N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:12.880 --> 00:19.520
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.320
Knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray.

00:21.320 --> 00:23.680
I have great respect for Knowledgefight.

00:23.680 --> 00:24.680
Knowledgefight.

00:24.680 --> 00:29.280
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys.

00:29.280 --> 00:30.280
Knowledgefight.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.280
Dan and Jordan.

00:31.280 --> 00:32.280
Knowledgefight.

00:32.280 --> 00:33.280
Need money.

00:33.280 --> 00:34.280
Andy and Kansas.

00:34.280 --> 00:35.280
Andy and Kansas.

00:35.280 --> 00:36.280
Stop it.

00:36.280 --> 00:37.280
Andy and Kansas.

00:37.280 --> 00:38.280
Andy and Kansas.

00:38.280 --> 00:39.280
It's time to pray.

00:39.280 --> 00:40.280
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air.

00:40.280 --> 00:41.280
Thanks for holding.

00:41.280 --> 00:42.280
Hello, Alex.

00:42.280 --> 00:43.280
I'm a first-time caller.

00:43.280 --> 00:44.280
I'm a huge fan.

00:44.280 --> 00:45.280
I love your room.

00:45.280 --> 00:46.280

I love you.

01:01.200 --> 01:02.720
I love you.

01:02.720 --> 01:03.720
I love you.

01:03.720 --> 01:04.800
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledgefight.

01:04.800 --> 01:05.800
I'm Dan.

01:05.800 --> 01:06.800
I'm Jordan.

01:06.800 --> 01:07.800
We're a couple dudes.

01:07.800 --> 01:08.800
I'd like to sit around, worship at the Altar of Selene and talk a little bit about Alex

01:08.800 --> 01:09.800
Jones.

01:09.800 --> 01:10.800
Oh, indeed we are, Dan.

01:10.800 --> 01:11.800
Jordan.

01:11.800 --> 01:12.800
Dan!

01:12.800 --> 01:13.800
Jordan.

01:13.800 --> 01:14.800
Quick question for you.

01:14.800 --> 01:15.800
What's up?

01:15.800 --> 01:16.800
What's your bright spot today?

01:16.800 --> 01:17.800
Why don't you go first?

01:17.800 --> 01:18.800
Well, obviously, there's only one bright spot for me, Dan.

01:18.800 --> 01:19.800
Yeah, I think I actually know what this is going to be.

01:19.800 --> 01:20.800
There's only one possible bright spot for me.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.360
Is it a really long bright spot?

01:22.360 --> 01:28.980
No, it will be fairly short. No. No, I mean the experience of watching it. Uh, it was it was fairly long

01:28.980 --> 01:30.380
Yeah

01:30.380 --> 01:35.980
There have been longer. There have been there have been significantly longer several hours. Perhaps there were

01:36.580 --> 01:40.060
Matches that have gone over two days before each. Uh, yeah, but

01:41.440 --> 01:44.320
no, uh Rafa and Djokovic played the

01:45.040 --> 01:46.400
I did almost say it

01:46.400 --> 01:51.080
I was thinking about him because I was going in my mind through the greatest matches in all of tennis history

01:51.080 --> 01:52.640
Mm-hmm and

01:52.640 --> 01:57.640
Djokovic and Rafa played the greatest clay court match in the history of tennis

01:58.160 --> 02:02.900
Without question the third set lasted an hour and 40 minutes. Mm-hmm

02:03.420 --> 02:09.580
that is the length of most Rafa on clay matches and that was just the third set and it was just

02:10.380 --> 02:16.840
Spectacular shot may get back and forth. It was no no, I mean it wasn't even that it was impossible shots left and right

02:16.840 --> 02:20.460
It was truly incredible and Djokovic won, unfortunately

02:20.460 --> 02:23.840
But I mean, there's no there's no shame there

02:24.360 --> 02:29.480
Three three points go a different way and Rafa wins six three six three six three

02:29.480 --> 02:33.040
Yeah, and even incredible even if you end up losing a match like that

02:33.040 --> 02:38.880
You were still a participant in it totally there's something to be said for like you were able to go that far, right?

02:38.880 --> 02:40.680
Right you were able to go that hard

02:40.680 --> 02:46.840
Yeah, totally and it's not like Rafa hasn't won enough French opens for people to think he's pretty good on clay. Mm-hmm

02:46.840 --> 02:49.280
He's won a few that's what I've heard. Yeah. Yeah

02:49.280 --> 02:54.880
He's been all right on clay for so for so long, but well, it was just it was incredible to watch

02:54.880 --> 03:00.560
Oh, I'm happy for you that you got to watch that if you were a tennis fan. It was a borderline religious experience

03:00.560 --> 03:02.720
I'm not joking. I got that from your text

03:04.240 --> 03:11.280
Intense it's an intense emotional experience. Well, my bright spot is actually kind of a athletic thing as well. Okay

03:11.960 --> 03:15.800
the recently the switch had the Nintendo switch has

03:15.800 --> 03:22.100
Updated it the game so you can now play Mario parties with people in other places. That's awesome

03:22.100 --> 03:26.860
Yeah, and so I've started playing some Mario parties with folks who live in other states

03:26.860 --> 03:31.940
Okay, some friends of mine and I am essentially undefeated. I

03:34.340 --> 03:40.520
Should grant I accept and I understand fully sure game is mostly random sure sure

03:41.060 --> 03:44.540
It's for children. Well, I understand all these things

03:44.540 --> 03:49.300
Um, but yeah, I've been I've been killing it in the the Mario party game

03:49.300 --> 03:55.380
I don't think there's anything wrong with getting confirmation as an adult that you could defeat children at something. Yeah, you know

03:55.380 --> 04:01.980
It's good. Yeah, it's nice. Sometimes you see kids do stuff and you're like, there's no chance I have at competing with that

04:01.980 --> 04:04.140
Yeah, you know and that makes you feel bad because you're an adult

04:04.140 --> 04:07.840
Mm-hmm, but really beating the shit out of kids can sometimes be well

04:07.840 --> 04:10.580
Maybe that's too far but really beating them can feel good

04:10.580 --> 04:16.820
One of the one of the fun things too about this this Mario party this this iteration of the game is that they have these spaces

04:16.820 --> 04:22.120
Where you can get a friend you can get an ally and so you'll just have like I always play as Waluigi

04:22.120 --> 04:23.600
Yeah, you know like of course you do. Of course

04:23.600 --> 04:28.960
I want to get Donkey Kong or Diddy Kong to be my friend and follow me around the board. Naturally. It's so fun

04:30.260 --> 04:34.340
Anyway, Jordan today we have an episode to go over. We're gonna be back into the present today

04:34.340 --> 04:39.980
Ooh, that's a bad place to be. It is. We're gonna be talking about June 10th, 2021, Blackjack. Ahh!

04:40.860 --> 04:46.620
Again, that's my new response to that. Bummer. Missed. Missed again. Maybe maybe that's the new bit

04:47.580 --> 04:49.580
so it's

04:50.540 --> 04:54.260
It's a day. It's a day. It's a monumental day in a lot of ways

04:55.300 --> 04:57.300
Okay, it is also a day of

04:57.900 --> 04:59.340
walking through

04:59.340 --> 05:01.340
Knee deep mud. Yeah

05:01.340 --> 05:04.380
for Alex's content. I imagine it's a day of

05:05.660 --> 05:12.420
Avoiding topics. Uh, yeah, not a lot of topics come up. Yeah, some very important things like whether or not we're all gonna die

05:13.100 --> 05:18.260
That is dealt with quite at length. I mean that seems pretty important

05:18.260 --> 05:23.260
Yes, unless the answer is no in which case it's not very important at all. Is it? You can put that on the back burner

05:23.260 --> 05:24.620
Okay, that's fair

05:24.620 --> 05:30.140
So today we're gonna get down to business on this but before we do let's say hello to some new wonks

05:30.140 --> 05:31.940
Oh, that's a great idea. So first, Dr.

05:31.940 --> 05:36.980
David strange hate or how I signed up for the patreon to get all of the podcast extras and the exclusive audio feed

05:36.980 --> 05:42.740
But I only got two because everything is uploaded as a video. Thank you so much. You're now policy wonk. I'm a policy wonk

05:43.460 --> 05:49.940
Thank you so much. To be clear to dr. Strange, David strange hate and everybody else. There's nothing that is behind a paywall

05:49.940 --> 05:55.340
Yeah, we tried very hard to keep things as far away from a paywall as possible and maybe we could do a better job

05:55.980 --> 05:57.980
putting some of those videos as audio, but

05:57.980 --> 05:59.180
Yeah

05:59.180 --> 06:05.340
Next from brother Ben Matt W. Thank you so much. You're now policy wonk. I'm a policy wonk

06:05.340 --> 06:08.460
Thank you very much Matt W. That was from his brother Ben. Oh, okay

06:09.420 --> 06:16.060
I freeze that. Yeah, next Emily Finch. Thank you so much. You're now policy wonk. I'm a policy wonk. Thanks Emily

06:16.060 --> 06:20.820
Oh and Blandy and candy. Thank you so much. You're now policy wonk. I'm a policy wonk

06:20.820 --> 06:22.740
Oh, thank you very much Blandy and candy

06:22.740 --> 06:30.100
Thank you and a couple of technocrats out there. I'd like to give a little wave to first Stevie P's most dirty dossier

06:30.100 --> 06:34.780
Thank you so much. You are now policy wonk and brew ha ha Chicago's drinking pot. Thank you so much

06:34.780 --> 06:42.060
You are now a technocrat. I'm a policy wonk crikey mate. That's fantastic. Have yourself a brew. How's your 401k doing, bro?

06:42.060 --> 06:46.060
All right, we got to go full tilt boogie on this Watson. All right, let's just get down to business

06:46.060 --> 06:51.620
We ain't making that money off that heroin. Why you pimps so good. My neck is freakishly large

06:51.620 --> 06:55.180
I declare info war on you. Thank you all so much

06:55.180 --> 07:01.980
Yes, thank you very much. Not to not to correct you but to clarify I believe Stevie P's dirty dossier is also a technocrat

07:02.500 --> 07:06.940
Correct. Yes, you accidentally said policy wonk. Oh, I'm sorry. Yes. I didn't want anybody

07:07.580 --> 07:13.080
You were gonna get so many Twitter messages that were used to been like, oh man. I appreciate you checking me

07:13.080 --> 07:16.340
I told you before we started recording. I barely got any sleep

07:16.340 --> 07:22.340
Totally that's what I'm here for. I'm not judging you. No, I appreciate the the subtle show

07:24.420 --> 07:28.380
So Jordan we have to do a little segment before we get into today's episode

07:28.380 --> 07:33.700
It's a segment that is taking the world by storm seems to be giving someone life is giving someone death

07:36.060 --> 07:38.060
You could say that

07:38.060 --> 07:44.380
Oh life is death you can that's true. Yep, so Renee

07:44.620 --> 07:50.020
Who is the best cat uncle and snail dad who had a birthday on the 6th? Happy birthday. Happy birthday

07:51.820 --> 07:54.640
Also, this is this is a this is a weird one

07:54.640 --> 08:00.660
Mm-hmm. So Sarah sent me a message and said that her friend Joe has a birthday in June June here

08:00.660 --> 08:02.380
Okay, so happy birthday Joe

08:02.380 --> 08:09.080
All right, Joe Sarah also told me that Joe will not say when his birthday is interesting just that it's

08:09.940 --> 08:15.720
I like this. Yeah, I like this a great deal. I am completely Phil Hartman in news radio

08:15.720 --> 08:20.860
I'm conflicted on one level. I enjoy people retaining some mystery in their life, of course

08:20.860 --> 08:23.620
But on the other hand, I'm like just tell your friend when the birthday is

08:25.300 --> 08:31.600
If you're not on Facebook, they might not remember anyway these days most people need that Facebook reminder to get a birthday

08:31.600 --> 08:33.600
I mean, there's only one way to

08:33.900 --> 08:39.460
If somebody doesn't want to tell you their birthday, then you have to surreptitiously discover it in any way pop

08:39.460 --> 08:44.960
You know, like follow them to the DMV one, right? You know just and then be in the corner just with a little

08:45.780 --> 08:51.660
Pair of magnifying glasses or your opera glasses if you will something along those lines, you know, you have to do something

08:51.660 --> 08:54.340
You gotta reach out to a podcast and have the host

08:54.340 --> 09:01.620
Oh, yeah, that's a good idea tell it tell Sarah what day your birth why haven't you texted his parents? They're there

09:01.620 --> 09:07.900
They're ready and waiting to give you their birthday. Yeah. Also, this is not a birthday. This is a congratulations to Camry

09:08.060 --> 09:10.920
This is graduating from the University of Ottawa. Oh

09:11.700 --> 09:15.820
Okay, engineering degree. I realize this is now just spiraling completely out of control

09:16.660 --> 09:23.500
We've lost it completely. This is this is our new show. Basically, I don't even know if we do Alex Jones related content anymore

09:23.500 --> 09:25.500
And we have one more one more birthday message

09:25.660 --> 09:30.700
This this fella Eric actually sent a message. He wanted me to read and be

09:32.020 --> 09:38.180
Jordan just shook his head. No, no. Sorry Eric Eric. Love you. That's a big that's a big shake of the head for me

09:38.180 --> 09:40.180
Happy 22nd birthday, Alexandra

09:40.420 --> 09:43.780
You're the happily ever after in my story, and I hope you have a wonderful day

09:44.060 --> 09:49.700
Remember to work for progress not perfection and keep sight of what's on the other side. There you go. All right

09:49.700 --> 09:53.860
Well, I'm not doing that again. That's a good wedding toast, but I don't think it's ever happened

09:53.860 --> 09:58.420
I'm not doing that again because we are getting dangerously close to territory that I am deeply uncomfortable

09:58.460 --> 10:04.860
No, we're we're borderline morning zoo crew at this. Yeah, but but Alexandra. Hope you have a great birthday. Yes, of course

10:05.700 --> 10:07.700
boy

10:08.340 --> 10:11.740
Being born is a condition that leads to death

10:12.720 --> 10:18.380
You can say that life is a disease that ends in death. Happy life is death day to all of you. Absolutely

10:18.380 --> 10:21.740
So Jordan we got to get this episode June 10th to go over

10:21.740 --> 10:27.820
All right, and here's not a context drop from today's show. My testicles are like, I guess like superstars. Yeah. All right

10:28.340 --> 10:34.080
Alex's testicles are superstars in what like in testicle related fields or or like

10:34.460 --> 10:40.060
As celebrity is it an influencer situation here as testicles average 17

10:40.060 --> 10:49.100
Rebound last season. Okay, so he starts out the show and I would describe it as

10:49.580 --> 10:55.460
Bad weird mood if he were anybody but himself sure since he is himself. It's a regular morning

10:55.460 --> 10:57.460
I would describe it as a pretty normal

10:58.660 --> 11:02.980
Now I've been saying this a lot before the shows just because all I do is tell you how I feel

11:02.980 --> 11:09.260
But I'm having a real trouble doing these products. It's a great way of putting it. That's a really great way because of

11:09.980 --> 11:11.980
how this is really

11:13.020 --> 11:15.600
Starting to set in on me that this is it

11:16.780 --> 11:23.820
And they're really killing people all around us and maybe people all around us and I was already ready today to come on air

11:24.660 --> 11:28.940
And look at the real numbers of the unprecedented amounts of young people

11:28.940 --> 11:34.860
having heart attacks having strokes even dying from the so-called COVID vaccines and

11:35.620 --> 11:37.580
then I

11:37.580 --> 11:39.580
Was sent a big Twitter feed

11:40.740 --> 11:45.060
By a good friend of mine a national talk show host about a 30 minutes for the show

11:45.060 --> 11:50.580
so I ended up reading this Twitter feed of medical documents and CDC numbers and

11:51.180 --> 11:53.180
I

11:53.180 --> 11:58.940
Actually got dizzy and almost passed out Alex almost passed out cuz he read a Twitter thread Wow

12:00.300 --> 12:03.900
Yeah, it's it's a little much it's kind of amazing how

12:05.140 --> 12:09.340
Accidentally self-aware that first bit. All I do is get on the radio and tell you how I feel

12:09.340 --> 12:14.780
Yeah, it's such a great like yeah, man. Yeah, you got it. You have identified the problem

12:15.340 --> 12:21.180
Yes, you nailed it. All you do people tune in to hear you feel things. Yeah, and it's

12:21.180 --> 12:28.860
Terrible, it's somehow weirdly cathartic for people who are really angry. Yes. Yeah. Oh god. No, that's me, isn't it?

12:30.060 --> 12:35.820
Fuck. Yeah, I um, I was interested in what was going on here. What was up with this Twitter thread?

12:35.820 --> 12:42.420
I wasn't so interested in his like I'm so angry. I can't do the show. Sure. It's so we've heard it

12:42.420 --> 12:49.540
Yeah happens all the time. Yeah, the present day is like it's it's it's so boring with something that's so

12:49.540 --> 12:53.620
Interesting. Mm-hmm. Like anybody else doing this would be

12:54.300 --> 12:56.300
good groundbreaking

12:58.820 --> 13:00.660
Anybody who had a boss

13:00.660 --> 13:03.540
Oh my god, they're gonna get fired. Yeah must mean it

13:03.540 --> 13:09.740
This is how TV shows start and then they get worse from there, but the first episode you like

13:09.740 --> 13:12.580
Yeah, it's Alex Alex talks a little bit more about this

13:13.140 --> 13:17.900
You know, you have that effect where quote women would get overwhelmed by something and just pass out

13:17.900 --> 13:21.540
And that's really the point. I've gotten to where I'm just like

13:22.660 --> 13:26.580
Nothing's stopping any of this. It's just rolling forward. I was reading

13:27.460 --> 13:33.660
about hundreds of thousands of people getting sick from the shots that are young how they're targeting our children and it just

13:33.900 --> 13:39.060
Pisses me off. And so my brain says go out and you know, do you know what people are doing this?

13:40.820 --> 13:45.080
I just it's just overwhelming. It's just overwhelming to watch him kill us like this

13:45.080 --> 13:47.080
So

13:47.080 --> 13:49.080
It is overwhelming that's pretty overwhelming

13:49.080 --> 13:54.200
so I looked up the most recent information on the CDC's website and there have been reports of

13:55.400 --> 13:59.560
5208 deaths of people who have gotten one of the kovat 19 vaccines. All right

13:59.560 --> 14:06.760
This is out of 302 million doses administered which represents a point zero zero one seven death rate. Oh, that's too dangerous

14:07.360 --> 14:14.200
So like but that's even if you assume the ridiculous absolute worst-case scenario that all of the deaths are even related or linked to the vaccines

14:14.200 --> 14:16.560
At all, it would be a point zero zero one seven

14:16.560 --> 14:22.760
It's just too dangerous for a vaccine Dan and the truth of the matter is that they are not all connected

14:22.760 --> 14:27.960
No, of course not. So so it's too dangerous to even hear about the vaccine. I guess so

14:27.960 --> 14:30.440
Yeah, it's also there is something that's been happening

14:31.160 --> 14:36.280
Lately there have been some more more reports of younger people having some heart inflammation

14:36.520 --> 14:42.680
Sure, that could be connected to vaccination and it's something that needs more study

14:42.680 --> 14:50.200
Of course, there have been 623 reports of myocarditis or pericarditis in persons aged 30 or under post vaccination

14:50.600 --> 14:56.120
These are primarily males and and through review of medical records. The CDC was able to confirm

14:56.760 --> 15:04.120
268 of these reports none of these cases have resulted in deaths and only 15 ended up hospitalized with 41 of them experiencing ongoing

15:04.760 --> 15:06.080
unspecified symptoms

15:06.080 --> 15:12.360
This is not good obviously and it's something that the CDC is investigating and when they have more information

15:12.360 --> 15:14.120
We'll know a bit more about it

15:14.120 --> 15:17.640
but the way that Alex is dealing with this story is just sensational to the point of

15:18.080 --> 15:23.520
Being dangerous like yeah, it makes me want to do you know what yeah, we do know what yeah

15:23.520 --> 15:30.640
You're talking about killing people. It is it is amazing that he's he's exemplary. You know, he's he's doing part of the trolley

15:32.200 --> 15:34.960
Ethical question where he's like, you know, we can't

15:35.600 --> 15:40.440
Hurt one person with a vaccine to save five other people's lives

15:40.440 --> 15:42.440
What we need to do is

15:42.760 --> 15:48.400
Throw that person in front of the train and then have the train run over the five people after that

15:48.400 --> 15:53.520
And then I live happily ever after and that person I'm gonna throw in front of a train is a doctor. Yes, exactly

15:53.880 --> 15:58.880
Yes, I'm going to get all of these people killed and then I'm going to jump on top of the train and fly

16:00.880 --> 16:05.000
Yeah, so the first hour I would say is meandering

16:05.000 --> 16:11.200
It's it's a bit meandering and it's unfortunate because as we as we learn in this this next clip

16:11.400 --> 16:16.800
Alex has so much news that he's so big like his balls. He's getting chills

16:17.760 --> 16:22.480
20 years ago out of a hundred or articles or so. There might be one really big one. I

16:23.840 --> 16:31.080
Have more than 50 devastating reports that are confirmed that send chills up my spine lightning round

16:31.080 --> 16:33.080
And

16:34.000 --> 16:37.400
It's just it's the real realization of how screwed we are

16:38.640 --> 16:43.860
It'd be like if I walked outside and looked up at the Sun and saw it like explode and I'd go oh my gosh

16:48.400 --> 16:52.080
It feels something kind of like that it's it's like the whoo Wow

16:53.320 --> 16:58.120
because they have set something in motion that is the planned organized total collapse of

16:58.120 --> 17:01.640
Civilization and mass death. So Alex is in a bad mood

17:05.080 --> 17:07.080
We're all dead

17:07.440 --> 17:13.680
It's pretty definite there doesn't seem to be much wiggle room. No, no, this was this would seem serious if here if you're

17:16.360 --> 17:18.360
Think that's the end for all of us

17:19.560 --> 17:24.280
Even if it was the planned explosion into a red giant earth is still gone, man. Yeah

17:24.280 --> 17:29.720
Yeah, and that the way he's speaking about this is obviously meant to be like there's nothing that you can do. We're all fucking dead

17:29.720 --> 17:33.960
Yeah, yeah, and it's um, I mean, it's certainly not inspiring

17:37.600 --> 17:45.320
That's the that's not the up-over-the-hill man charge that you necessarily want, right?

17:45.320 --> 17:52.740
I know that Patton when he was giving some of his sort of famous speeches generally be like we're fucking

17:52.740 --> 17:54.700
We're screwed

17:54.700 --> 18:00.860
We shall fight them on the beaches. It won't matter. You're all fucking dead. I saw the song blow up

18:02.860 --> 18:05.880
So I think that if you see the Sun blow up metaphorically

18:06.260 --> 18:09.540
One of the things that you might want to do is run away to a bunker

18:10.300 --> 18:15.180
You know, I mean if it's the Sun you I would just lay down and be like, let's do this man

18:15.180 --> 18:21.100
There's no hope at this point. That's why I said metaphorically. Okay metaphorically you might want to run away to the hills

18:21.100 --> 18:24.940
Sure, and Alex is certainly feeling that pressure. Okay, it's the end of civilization

18:26.180 --> 18:29.860
Fast and it's not even a selfishness, but my very cells

18:30.860 --> 18:36.800
Say get out of Austin get your family out and go to the most remote area and dig in now go

18:37.020 --> 18:42.780
But if we do that the globalist win boo, and they're gonna accelerate their collapse and finally dig us out of our holes later

18:42.780 --> 18:54.060
Every show is now coming out with dystopic mass death planetary extermination robots killing us

18:55.220 --> 18:57.220
under you in command because they're

18:57.820 --> 19:04.740
Pre-conditioning everyone to accept that and that that is the future that's about to unfold and I mean the video games the movies

19:04.740 --> 19:09.900
All of it. What about movies from like the 60s about robots? No, no

19:09.900 --> 19:11.900
I don't know

19:11.940 --> 19:17.380
Battlestar Galactica never happened every movie is now about the UN having killer robots

19:19.300 --> 19:24.140
That's true I find it so funny that we're also in the past and he's like

19:24.380 --> 19:29.360
I'm pretty sure that Saddam is in the United States or he's in Russia in Australia

19:29.360 --> 19:34.220
And then he's like they're gonna come and dig us up out of our holes and I'm like, ah, you don't even know man

19:34.220 --> 19:36.220
Oh you in the past don't even know

19:37.580 --> 19:39.580
Some people get dug out of holes buddy

19:39.580 --> 19:39.940
Yeah

19:39.940 --> 19:46.940
so Alex is pretty pretty doom heavy here like even actually kind of more so than usual like I think a lot of the

19:46.940 --> 19:48.980
Time he doesn't descend this deeply

19:49.700 --> 19:54.700
Into that abyss. It seems early too. It's it was immediate. Yeah, that's

19:55.380 --> 20:01.620
You gotta you gotta ease me into that. It was immediate and it kept going over commercial breaks

20:01.620 --> 20:06.960
Like you'd go to commercial and he'd come back and he was still doing this. All right. Okay fucking die

20:06.960 --> 20:13.900
All right, so we're in we're in full-on the the guy and watchmen shouting for the end of the world territory

20:13.900 --> 20:20.180
That's what was that's what's going on. Well, here's the situation Jordan when you have been like, let's say I

20:20.580 --> 20:25.980
Don't know convicted of a horrible crime and you're put in front of the the firing squad. Sure. They'll put a little

20:25.980 --> 20:32.100
A blindfold over you. Yeah, I was polite. Yeah, so you don't have to see the bullet coming

20:32.100 --> 20:35.580
You don't want to do that Alex is doing the opposite and in this next clip

20:35.580 --> 20:42.060
He wonders if maybe he shouldn't do the opposite. Maybe he should allow people to just have a blindfold. Okay

20:44.700 --> 20:48.340
This is not a deer in the headlights moment, it's

20:50.300 --> 20:52.300
It's almost obscene

20:52.300 --> 20:58.020
To even tell everybody this it's kind of like they put a blindfold on somebody who's in a firing squad

20:58.700 --> 21:01.980
so they'd have to watch themselves be killed and

21:03.420 --> 21:07.260
They and they give you a cigarette maybe a little bottle of brandy an hour before

21:08.460 --> 21:10.460
also polite

21:11.500 --> 21:13.500
So, you know what

21:14.700 --> 21:18.540
The public's not gonna wake up and stop this anyways, they don't want to they're that we're cursed

21:18.540 --> 21:23.260
We kill our babies they kill our old people. And so I guess I

21:24.140 --> 21:26.620
just guess prepare to have everything collapsed and

21:27.820 --> 21:34.460
Destroyed and and to die. I mean, I guess that's just really it prepare to die seems to be Alex's message

21:35.900 --> 21:41.260
Today, I mean that's a what what day was the 10th was that those Thursday that was Thursday

21:41.260 --> 21:46.060
Yeah, right before the weekend. I get it. No, I get it. You know, it's like Arthur Dent

21:46.060 --> 21:52.300
You know, it's like Arthur Dent. He just never got the hang of Thursdays man that happens. What are you gonna do? It's tough

21:53.100 --> 21:58.980
You know, it's like everybody's working for the weekend. Mm-hmm. It's just rough. Yeah lover boy

21:59.980 --> 22:01.980
Pissed off his hell about Thursdays

22:03.700 --> 22:08.540
So there might be an answer yeah, maybe and from listening to this clip

22:08.540 --> 22:11.340
I don't know if this is exactly the message you're gonna take away from it

22:11.340 --> 22:17.420
But it seems to me like maybe the answer is blindly accepting whatever Alex wants you to do

22:17.740 --> 22:20.140
And not questioning anything and just doing it

22:20.540 --> 22:27.100
Wow seems to be what he thinks will solve all the problems in the world vis-a-vis the globalist. So he's starting a religion

22:27.660 --> 22:28.780
maybe

22:28.780 --> 22:30.780
Because this mad scientist evil

22:31.420 --> 22:33.420
this post-humanist evil

22:34.860 --> 22:36.860
Has figured out all the angles

22:36.860 --> 22:44.860
and the only way you beat it is recognizing the angles and it's full spectrum assault and then do the exact opposite but

22:46.220 --> 22:52.940
Instead the public likes to debate and argue and act silly and and and fight with each other at the low level

22:53.260 --> 22:54.380
And if you do that

22:54.380 --> 22:58.220
We have zero chance if we just woke up and accepted god

22:58.620 --> 23:05.340
And and did what god said to do and stood against the new world order then this evil would just evaporate like

23:05.340 --> 23:07.340
Phantom is it gone?

23:11.740 --> 23:16.380
That everybody can feel it everybody can see it

23:19.820 --> 23:21.820
And

23:23.260 --> 23:27.180
That's just what it comes down to so here's what I'm gonna do

23:27.180 --> 23:37.500
Here's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna make sure we stay on here as long as we can and make sure that that's dealt with

23:37.500 --> 23:39.500
Make sure our own house is in order

23:39.980 --> 23:42.220
And then i'm gonna come back and i'm gonna hit all this finish

23:43.020 --> 23:45.340
As best I can i'm just gonna cover it and then that's gonna be it

23:46.700 --> 23:48.700
What

23:48.700 --> 23:56.060
Alex you're still doing a great job, but maybe next few segments you can't put stuff on screen because

23:57.580 --> 23:59.900
I'm here talking and they just put a screen clip up

24:00.540 --> 24:06.700
Of people in new york saying we want to wear masks forever. We don't want to take them off. We like them. There are blankets

24:09.500 --> 24:10.620
Sure

24:10.620 --> 24:12.620
And that's something I was going to cover later, but see

24:13.660 --> 24:15.660
That's painful to look at

24:15.660 --> 24:18.540
And so i'm right on the edge of just not being able to handle this anymore

24:19.420 --> 24:22.800
Plus it it then just becomes a distraction

24:23.340 --> 24:25.900
From what i'm already covering what i'm doing and i'm not bitching at the crew

24:26.220 --> 24:31.020
I told them to put stuff up on screen. It's just this point. I may have to start doing a show in a radio booth

24:32.540 --> 24:37.340
And the crew can go run other shows or something and i'm just going to go back to reading articles and covering those because

24:37.740 --> 24:44.220
Because I can't look at joe biden. I can't look at the mask cult. I can't look at another animal human clone

24:44.220 --> 24:50.620
Aren't we already dead? What's going on? Okay, so if I understand correctly, here's how the show is going so far

24:51.260 --> 24:57.180
I think also that clip is very indicative of how the show is going. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, please

24:57.500 --> 25:04.860
Yeah, so if I understand correctly, we're all dead. We're all already dead. Yes. We need to prepare to die. Yeah, uh,

25:05.580 --> 25:10.060
My crew put up a picture of joe biden and uh people supporting him

25:10.060 --> 25:14.860
So I am going to throw a hissy fit. I'm gonna go off the air. Uh

25:15.580 --> 25:18.060
The end I don't even think it's i'm gonna go off the air

25:18.140 --> 25:24.800
It's that i'm gonna i'm gonna threaten to just do radio now because i'm too distracted by images. That's bananas

25:25.340 --> 25:33.340
That is unprofessional to a level of like I think pathology. I think I think it's honestly just solving the wrong problem

25:33.980 --> 25:35.980
you know

25:35.980 --> 25:41.100
I'm too distracted by pictures to do my job and therefore get rid of the pictures

25:41.660 --> 25:43.580
I guess I guess it is a solution

25:43.580 --> 25:50.300
But you know if somebody jangles plastic keys in the room, I can no longer function as a human being

25:50.460 --> 25:56.060
So just get rid of all plastic keys everywhere dan. It makes perfect sense. That does make sense unless

25:56.460 --> 26:02.300
Jangling plastic keys are a major component of your job. There is that yeah, that is a problem

26:02.300 --> 26:09.260
Yeah, I do work at a jangling keys factory. So there is there are a lot of disorienting things. You might have to learn

26:10.060 --> 26:11.980
how to

26:11.980 --> 26:18.380
Focus your attention, uh better you could change you that was possible. I'm just tossing that out there. Yeah

26:18.620 --> 26:23.020
yeah, and I and I think I think that that also the idea of like

26:23.340 --> 26:27.900
If you just saw all the angles and all this we would just be able to defeat the new world order

26:27.900 --> 26:33.900
Yeah, like that's that's just your code for like if everybody just thought the exact same way I did. Oh, yeah

26:34.060 --> 26:39.260
Oh, yeah, nonsense if we all just did what god told us to do who's telling me what god is telling me to do

26:39.500 --> 26:44.380
Let me ask you that question because that's a really important question. Spoiler alert. It's alex. Yeah, that sounds right

26:44.620 --> 26:47.660
so, uh the vaccine side effects are something that alex is

26:48.140 --> 26:54.700
Greatly exaggerating and not dealing with seriously. Um, and uh, if you need any more evidence of that

26:54.700 --> 26:58.300
You know, the worst thing is uh, reading all these federal documents

26:59.500 --> 27:05.740
And how they know by design that they're giving the young people shots now that are going to mess up their hearts livers and brains

27:06.860 --> 27:09.100
And lungs for life, which is not going to be very long

27:11.020 --> 27:14.220
And then of course I I knew this a while ago while they're doing it

27:18.860 --> 27:20.860
Not just about killing you

27:20.860 --> 27:22.860
Yeah

27:23.740 --> 27:26.540
It's a sacrifice to the youth and that pleases their god

27:27.500 --> 27:31.900
And also it's going to weigh down and hurt their families and cause great anguish in their families

27:32.380 --> 27:36.060
Because you're supposed to bury your parents not bury your children. Yeah, you see you see

27:36.700 --> 27:44.460
These vaccines the the the side effects that people might experience are a sacrament to satan, right? Yep, right, right

27:45.100 --> 27:47.100
right

27:47.100 --> 27:50.540
I just can't disagree with any of that. Sure

27:51.420 --> 27:54.860
It's just airtight. You're not supposed to bury your parents

27:55.740 --> 28:00.380
Or I mean the other way around i've heard that said yeah parents not supposed to bury their child

28:00.460 --> 28:01.900
Yeah, see there we go

28:01.900 --> 28:08.380
And then if that makes sense, I assume that all the preceding arguments have to make sense as well it all it all tracks

28:08.460 --> 28:13.260
Yeah, so the public is in a trance and that is a problem for alex because his whole thing is about like

28:13.260 --> 28:18.780
Dealing with people who aren't in a trance. Yeah, but it seems like that is the better thing if we're all gonna die

28:18.780 --> 28:23.660
No matter what as he was arguing earlier, maybe just let people stay in the trance put on a blindfold

28:23.660 --> 28:28.140
Yeah, I think that alex is essentially admitting failure here because

28:28.860 --> 28:34.860
His self-appointed role is that guy who yells and wakes people up out of their trance exactly

28:34.860 --> 28:41.260
So if his primary complaint is that people are too much in a trance that means that you are ineffective at the job

28:41.260 --> 28:46.620
You have given yourself. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so I don't know if I don't know if I would be proud of this next clip

28:46.620 --> 28:50.160
If I were alex, okay, and then I just see the public mesmerized

28:51.260 --> 28:55.100
Into a trance watching their sports and playing their video games

28:56.540 --> 28:58.780
And I can't join the globalist because that

28:58.780 --> 29:11.580
That's evil and I don't want to prey on people and then most of the public he says predator. I'm saying

29:12.780 --> 29:19.020
I guess we're just here to tell the truth and let people make a decision for themselves and it'll all work out in god's plan

29:20.140 --> 29:22.140
but uh

29:23.740 --> 29:26.140
I mean, I feel like i'm being punched in the chest right now

29:26.140 --> 29:29.180
And I I don't know what it is. I'm supposed to do to not feel like that

29:29.420 --> 29:34.940
I don't really feel good about everything i'm doing quit your job and almost always when I feel like this. It means there's some answer

29:35.820 --> 29:38.620
There's something we're supposed to do right now. I'm going to stop this

29:39.340 --> 29:42.140
I guess that's really what it is. I feel extreme guilt

29:43.020 --> 29:45.180
And I'm not someone in my life that feels a lot of guilt

29:45.900 --> 29:48.140
You should I know that you should feel a lot of guilt

29:49.180 --> 29:52.220
That's why I may have to go off here today because I don't want to just sit up here and talk about how I feel

29:52.220 --> 29:57.180
Oh, this isn't some calculated thing before I came in today to say all this I I I

29:58.700 --> 30:05.260
I have stacks of government documents stacks of reports that are all total nightmares all ten on a richter scale of tyranny

30:07.740 --> 30:08.700
Just

30:08.700 --> 30:14.380
Just some person nearby just needs to be like alex. Just do your job

30:14.380 --> 30:22.060
Yeah, just shut up and do your job. Yeah, what are you doing? Don't talk about how well you could do your job. Yes

30:23.260 --> 30:29.420
Don't talk about how it's everybody else's fault. You can't do your job a little annoying just do your job man

30:30.060 --> 30:34.380
Just one time and I would I would argue that it actually is

30:34.860 --> 30:41.500
A calculated thing that alex is doing and not necessarily because he decided to get on air and act like a weirdo

30:41.500 --> 30:44.140
It's that he didn't prepare at all exactly

30:44.780 --> 30:51.420
He chose not to get ready to do his show at all. And so he has to fill time rambling about nothing now

30:51.500 --> 30:53.500
We're all gonna die

30:53.820 --> 30:59.100
You can't just come out and say sorry. Yeah, I have to burn an hour because i've only got two I have

30:59.980 --> 31:03.420
Too much news to get over. I have to talk about all of this

31:04.140 --> 31:06.620
I'm gonna kill a third of the show saying

31:06.620 --> 31:12.060
Complete horseshit, nothing gotta gotta do that. I gotta do that to really get into the news

31:12.140 --> 31:15.900
But you know what else he has to do. What's that predict things? Okay

31:16.540 --> 31:21.260
And we'll be sitting here in a year or two with you know, run 10k to raise money

31:21.660 --> 31:26.460
Because you know all the neurological problems and they'll have movie stars up there. Well, let's get together and

31:27.820 --> 31:31.100
Finally at a certain point 10 years down the road or even sooner they'll say well

31:32.220 --> 31:34.720
Folks are signing on to volunteer to be euthanized

31:34.720 --> 31:36.800
because they know they're too much of a weight on society and

31:38.880 --> 31:42.960
They'll get some extra money and get to party for a few weeks before they are killed

31:43.760 --> 31:46.080
And that's all the plan here. That's the plan

31:46.720 --> 31:48.720
Is this plan f now?

31:48.800 --> 31:53.360
We got a lot of plans on the air a lot of plans up in the air all the time

31:53.440 --> 31:58.720
I don't know. I don't know if I can handle this many plans. They don't seem like complementary plans. No, they sure don't

31:58.880 --> 32:02.160
Yeah, so then two years celebrities will be doing

32:02.160 --> 32:07.040
5k charity things. Yeah, I would assume that's true not necessarily for people who

32:07.600 --> 32:12.880
like were hurt by a vaccine side effect from covid but sure, you know, there are certainly

32:13.200 --> 32:17.520
You know experiences that people have had about long covid, you know, there's totally there are

32:18.160 --> 32:23.920
Things that we will learn moving forward that we're not aware of now or we're starting to become aware of now

32:24.160 --> 32:28.160
I could see celebrities doing fundraising for some sort of charity

32:28.160 --> 32:31.760
Uh in that line. Yeah, 10 years from now

32:31.840 --> 32:38.080
Alex believes there will be so many people who have been hurt by the covid vaccine right that there will be

32:38.940 --> 32:40.000
euthanasia

32:40.000 --> 32:42.960
Uh drives going on where you get to party

32:43.600 --> 32:49.520
Aha a little bit if you agree to let them kill you get a little extra money. Yeah, and you then that's for your family

32:49.600 --> 32:50.640
Yeah, okay

32:50.640 --> 32:54.240
So it's a little bit like looper is that kind of what we're dealing with here?

32:54.240 --> 32:59.120
We're dealing with you sign a contract for about 10 years and then you get killed like I I I guess

32:59.200 --> 33:04.240
It's kind of like suicide bombers, but without the bomb it does seem a little bit like that. Yeah, I don't know

33:04.240 --> 33:08.720
I don't I think this is uh, one of them, uh, predictions that alex is gonna forget he made

33:09.840 --> 33:15.920
Who's gonna run the 5k's 10 years from now when we've got all these euthanasia drives going all the runners will be dead

33:18.240 --> 33:20.240
I assume they're the first to go. Uh-huh

33:20.240 --> 33:25.520
So when you were worried about like who's gonna be uh, interpreting the words of god. Yes

33:26.240 --> 33:29.200
And I told you it was alex. Yeah, I tend to be worried about that, too

33:29.280 --> 33:36.000
I believe that it's alex primarily because he seems to think that churches are all full of betrayers. Well, there's that so this is

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
in today's stuff

33:38.720 --> 33:40.720
And your church isn't gonna say a word

33:41.760 --> 33:43.360
They just want to party

33:43.360 --> 33:47.600
They just want to have a good time a lot like churches. I know well, I'm not gonna say a word

33:47.600 --> 33:50.240
Have a good time a lot like churches. I know

33:52.320 --> 33:54.320
Hell

33:54.640 --> 33:57.520
You're not gonna find more satanic group of people than the folks that run the churches

33:57.920 --> 34:02.480
Because they're the real betrayers that went there to make sure there wouldn't be a church to fight this when it was needed

34:03.840 --> 34:06.320
So i'm sorry folks i'm real sorry

34:07.200 --> 34:12.400
And i'm not trying to depress you, you know, it means god's plans real and we're being judged but this is gonna be rough

34:12.400 --> 34:17.360
My church wants to party all the time

34:18.000 --> 34:23.600
God there were so many fucking parties at my church when I was young. Oh god all the time

34:24.300 --> 34:30.560
Non-stop partying even the parties that we did have at our church weren't fun. No, we didn't even have communion wine

34:30.640 --> 34:38.320
We run out from so many fucking parties. Dan. We we in our youth group. We had like, uh, every every I think it was every

34:38.320 --> 34:43.300
sunday, uh, we have evening sunday evening, uh, just youth group, uh,

34:43.860 --> 34:50.660
Services or whatever and afterwards they'd get uh papa john's pizza. Yes, right. Yeah, but you had to pay for slice

34:51.940 --> 34:54.100
That's not fun. That's not a party

34:55.060 --> 34:57.060
In the church. Yeah. Oh, man

34:57.140 --> 35:04.660
You realized jesus would have run in there and started throwing pizza all around the place like no commerce in this motherfucking place

35:04.660 --> 35:11.860
Right flipping the pepperoncini box. Of course get the also olives olives. Yeah, it was uh, not fun

35:12.260 --> 35:17.940
I'm jesus and I don't like olives this episode is just a mess

35:18.180 --> 35:23.220
yeah, like the whole first hour is this it is outrageous like and it's

35:24.660 --> 35:29.620
it's even worse once alex starts trying to explain why he's feeling the way he is because

35:30.180 --> 35:32.180
It's just such bullshit

35:32.180 --> 35:37.860
So here's what sent me for a tailspin because I already knew all this but it kind of all crystallized 10 minutes for the show

35:44.980 --> 35:46.980
And then

35:51.380 --> 35:55.220
There's some things I want to tell you and I can't tell you because the sources they told me not to sure

35:55.860 --> 35:57.220
and i've never

35:57.220 --> 36:02.180
michael own a source and i've never given information out sometimes there's information you can't get out because

36:02.740 --> 36:04.340
If you get out any of it

36:04.340 --> 36:09.780
It gives it away from the source before they finish the work they're doing but there's a major counter-strike to all this in the works

36:09.860 --> 36:11.620
right now

36:11.620 --> 36:18.340
But uh, it's been confirmed the documents have been seen that this is a kill plan. So there's a kill plan. Um

36:19.460 --> 36:20.420
Okay

36:20.420 --> 36:21.140
All right

36:21.140 --> 36:27.460
So yeah, alex has a source that he can't give up sure and he can't speak in specifics because the source, you know

36:27.540 --> 36:31.940
Blow their cover still working too hard. Yes still working under under cover

36:32.500 --> 36:36.900
I guess is alex talking to steve again. Is this a double agent situation?

36:36.900 --> 36:40.900
Is this somebody in the government who's viewing the kill plan documents?

36:41.600 --> 36:45.460
Anybody who actually has access to anything would never talk to a dick like this

36:46.180 --> 36:48.180
No one would talk to alex

36:48.180 --> 36:52.100
He gets on air and talks about how we're all gonna die for an hour at the beginning of his show

36:52.340 --> 36:56.180
Yep, i'm gonna be like, oh, hey alex. I've got to get your brain in on this

36:56.980 --> 37:02.020
See, this is why I just can't be allowed to be part of the government because I swear to god

37:02.180 --> 37:07.060
I would crank call alex at least once a week and be like i've got some documents for you

37:07.140 --> 37:12.980
I'd send him pictures of bullshit. It would never not be hilarious to me for them to show up the next day

37:12.980 --> 37:18.420
Yeah, it would just never not be fun. I'm not certain that you have to work in the government to do that

37:18.740 --> 37:20.740
Get yourself a proton mail, uh

37:21.700 --> 37:23.700
sure

37:24.820 --> 37:30.500
You could probably uh plant some stories lieutenant colonel bull s hit

37:32.100 --> 37:34.260
At protonmail.com. Mr. Bull

37:36.740 --> 37:38.740
My grandpa served

37:38.740 --> 37:45.620
Under you and uh, which one did your great grandpa serve in was the north or the south which one was it?

37:46.820 --> 37:49.380
Texas, okay, texas. Okay. Okay. I got you

37:49.540 --> 37:50.340
Um, so yeah

37:50.340 --> 37:57.620
I guess alex was sent into a tailspin at the beginning or right before the show because of some secret information that he got from

37:57.620 --> 37:58.500
a source

37:58.500 --> 38:03.860
Or a twitter thread that he read that almost made him pass out sure not entirely sure which

38:04.420 --> 38:08.100
It is but maybe his secret source is this twitter thread. I don't know

38:08.100 --> 38:12.580
I mean, I understand being thrown off by what would be relatively petty things

38:12.660 --> 38:15.940
like one thing that threw me off during that clip was literally going like

38:16.420 --> 38:19.140
Why don't I remember the theme song to tailspin?

38:19.860 --> 38:26.900
And then I realized that because every time I think about the theme song to tailspin I go did it tailspin we and i'm like

38:27.700 --> 38:31.060
That's ducktails. That's ducktails. I can't do that. Do you remember tailspin?

38:31.140 --> 38:34.580
I think I did the exact same thing that you did in my head just then yeah

38:34.580 --> 38:39.220
I think that it might not have had lyrics. I remember having loud drums

38:39.380 --> 38:43.540
I think the tailspin theme song didn't have lyrics. I think it was just instrumental interesting

38:43.620 --> 38:45.940
I'm, not sure but I did do the ducktail set

38:46.740 --> 38:52.820
Totally totally so we got a kill plan on our hands not entirely sure exactly how this is going to play out. Uh,

38:53.300 --> 38:58.340
Who do you think is way up at the top of this and I i'll tell you sure not a person organization

38:59.940 --> 39:03.460
Okay, so if you're asking me it can't be the un that seems too obvious

39:03.460 --> 39:06.660
Well, actually i'm asking you because we've been listening to this show

39:07.380 --> 39:10.980
for all the time that covet has existed yes, and

39:12.020 --> 39:13.780
You should know

39:13.780 --> 39:20.420
By now who's running all this? Oh, if there's a kill plan sure who's running it. Well the devil, of course

39:20.660 --> 39:24.020
No, no, no, no. Oh china. No biden. No

39:24.660 --> 39:26.660
Stelter. No fauci. No

39:27.460 --> 39:28.740
the cfr

39:28.740 --> 39:29.540
No

39:29.540 --> 39:31.540
the un no

39:31.540 --> 39:33.540
Brazil no, who cares?

39:34.340 --> 39:40.580
I've been talking to folks that have seen the official government plans. Uh-huh cia put out by the

39:42.100 --> 39:43.620
major foundations

39:43.620 --> 39:45.300
oh the uh

39:45.300 --> 39:46.500
carny endowment

39:46.500 --> 39:52.520
That's why the carny endowment is not in full control get bill gates once again. The cia is run by the carny endowment

39:52.980 --> 39:57.140
And it's just a total extermination plan. I mean final solution. We're all dead

39:57.140 --> 40:03.700
It's like wow. Wow, you guys are really evil because I knew they were evil but man

40:04.500 --> 40:06.980
It's bad enough wanting to wipe out third world people

40:07.940 --> 40:09.940
I don't want to kill them, but I know that

40:10.100 --> 40:15.620
They don't have jobs futures any of that. I'm not signed on to kill them. But this plan is to kill everybody

40:15.780 --> 40:17.780
Whoa, that got weird at the end there

40:18.340 --> 40:20.580
Um that is that's just bad writing

40:20.740 --> 40:26.340
That's just bad writing to all of a sudden come up with a brand new villain at the very end to swoop in and cause

40:26.340 --> 40:29.860
That's like if at the end of the scooby-doo episode. They took the mask off and they're like

40:30.260 --> 40:33.220
Terry from three towns down the street. What are you doing here?

40:33.220 --> 40:39.300
And he's like, oh just do this i'm certain that alex has never been like big on the carnegie endowment, but it's true

40:39.620 --> 40:40.980
That was not some

40:40.980 --> 40:48.740
Organization that's come up as one of our even in the mix. No players. No, not tertiary not tangential just gone

40:48.740 --> 40:56.420
John's hopkins is constantly a villain the gates foundation. Of course nation naturally, uh, cfr, obviously

40:56.500 --> 40:59.220
Yeah, the uh, the rockefeller foundation

41:00.020 --> 41:02.020
Yeah, I don't know. I I uh

41:02.580 --> 41:09.300
I mean the rothchilds are always in the mix. You could have just tossed the rothchilds in there. Nope carnegie endowment carnegie endowment, boo

41:11.060 --> 41:16.660
You know, you know what you have to do to destroy the world dan practice practice practice also fuck alex

41:16.660 --> 41:22.260
We're saying uh that stuff about people in the developing world. They have no future. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh fuck yourself. Fuck yourself

41:22.580 --> 41:28.820
Um, so alex has these sources that have told him about the kill plan and he doesn't just believe these sources now

41:28.820 --> 41:33.300
I should tell you he does just believe these well naturally, but he doesn't just believe no

41:34.020 --> 41:36.180
I mean, I see i've just got stuff like that going on

41:37.140 --> 41:40.180
And I don't just believe people that have seen the documents

41:41.220 --> 41:43.700
I can see the documents all in front of me how they're implementing it

41:43.700 --> 41:47.480
Everything I was told by the individual that saw this plan

41:48.440 --> 41:55.960
And held the plan is in event 201. The plan is in lockstep. The plan is in crimson contagion. The plan is all there

41:57.080 --> 42:00.920
But but specifically they've reached the point now of recruiting

42:01.960 --> 42:06.280
Levels deep into government corporations and are have gone operational now

42:06.680 --> 42:10.040
So they're even telling people the plan to get them on board

42:10.040 --> 42:13.480
Hey, like, uh, you know, you and your family are going to live

42:14.680 --> 42:17.400
If you want to be part of that 500 million that live

42:18.760 --> 42:23.800
It's on the georgia guide stones. You better get on board right now and you'll get up space for your family

42:24.520 --> 42:26.360
during the collapse

42:26.360 --> 42:29.640
But of course you read deeper and this is what these individuals were able to see

42:30.280 --> 42:34.840
it's exactly what they've told us that they believe all humans must be gotten rid of and

42:34.840 --> 42:39.720
And above that there's not much knowledge, but everybody including top pentagon four-star generals

42:39.960 --> 42:42.760
They think it's aliens some deal has been made with aliens to kill everybody

42:43.000 --> 42:45.560
and then the people that the small group that does it gets to like

42:46.040 --> 42:48.040
Like the board or whatever join these things. I

42:48.600 --> 42:51.000
Man, all i'm telling you is is that everybody's dead

42:51.560 --> 42:53.560
That's all I can tell you everybody's dead

42:54.680 --> 42:56.120
I mean

42:56.120 --> 43:03.000
If the if true, uh, I I guess there's nothing really we can do right? I mean if you make a deal with aliens

43:03.000 --> 43:06.440
Um, that's out of my that's above my pay grade four-star generals

43:07.160 --> 43:09.480
Think there's a deal with aliens

43:10.840 --> 43:13.320
Then we gotta get new generals. Yeah, that would be good

43:14.440 --> 43:20.600
Um, yeah, there's been a deal with it. Yeah, there's only gonna be 500 billion left. We made a deal with aliens

43:20.600 --> 43:25.960
It's a real bummer. Yeah, I mean on the one hand what if the aliens other deal was like we kill everybody

43:26.200 --> 43:28.200
That's a good deal

43:28.200 --> 43:36.760
Um compared to that. Yeah compared to the human extinction if we live in a scenario where there is kill everyone

43:36.840 --> 43:44.520
Or kill all but a hundred people. Yeah, obviously kill all but a hundred people is the preferable option to everybody dying. Exactly. Um,

43:45.240 --> 43:47.320
Yeah, I mean it's all made up. So sure

43:48.120 --> 43:53.080
Sure. Sure. It's we go back to the trolley problem again. Alex is just feeling bad

43:53.080 --> 43:59.400
What if there are 7.7 billion people in front of a train and we've got a hundred we could save

43:59.560 --> 44:00.920
I think it makes perfect sense

44:00.920 --> 44:06.280
So you got to just get right with god because everybody's gonna die and alex is just he's giving very little hope

44:06.600 --> 44:11.720
Uh at all in this first hour sure get right with god. Do the aliens know god?

44:13.320 --> 44:17.880
It's it's debatable whether they're actually aliens they might be demons they might be demons that's fair

44:18.120 --> 44:21.480
You're right. So you got to get right with god and then alex introduces a guest

44:21.480 --> 44:26.760
He's gonna have and mike down for this because he honestly sounds a little bit pissed that he's gonna be interviewed

44:26.760 --> 44:27.800
Oh no

44:27.800 --> 44:33.720
And the dominoes are falling the the the the the the program has already started the countdown is here

44:34.360 --> 44:37.960
And I I don't know what to do. I just get right with god. That's all I can say

44:40.040 --> 44:42.040
Instead we'll talk to my pillow guy

44:42.520 --> 44:48.840
Which will be fun. I'm sure nice guy really cares. That's a good heart fight the tyranny. Wow

44:48.840 --> 44:50.440
Wow

44:50.440 --> 44:52.440
Get right with god

44:54.440 --> 44:59.720
You can almost hear the silent we're gonna talk to the fucking my pillow. Yes, totally. No. No, I heard it

44:59.800 --> 45:02.680
I heard the fucking that was not spoken so loud

45:02.920 --> 45:08.200
so this is the episode of mike lindell from my pillow comes on for his first appearance on info wars, which is

45:08.600 --> 45:14.760
Baffling that it's his first appearance. That is baffling. Yeah for it says a lot for a guy to go from

45:14.760 --> 45:20.120
Um, limerick soap man to shit talking the my pillow guy

45:20.600 --> 45:23.960
I'm, just saying maybe you're uh getting above your britches there, buddy

45:24.040 --> 45:28.360
Well, I was thinking about like what the dynamics are here and why alex might be like

45:29.000 --> 45:33.560
Not super happy about this and I think why mike wouldn't be super happy about this either

45:33.960 --> 45:37.480
Is is because neither of this is neither of their first choice. No

45:38.040 --> 45:43.640
um alex probably doesn't want to talk to him because he's nuts and he sounds and

45:43.640 --> 45:49.800
He has the potential to drag alex into litigation with uh, you know slanderous claims. Totally. Yeah

45:49.800 --> 45:54.200
Yeah, he's throwing him around like water. Yeah, and I think that he's somebody who

45:54.920 --> 45:59.000
Um, you know, you could you could end up getting uh dragged into court

45:59.800 --> 46:03.480
for having too close of an association with particularly in uh,

46:04.040 --> 46:07.340
This sort of a setting interviewing them and allowing them to broadcast

46:08.020 --> 46:09.640
slanderous claims

46:09.640 --> 46:10.920
about uh

46:10.920 --> 46:16.760
Various things it does people and organizations. It does seem like mike lindell comes along with the same

46:17.300 --> 46:23.240
Producer as like a prank show where after you talk to mike lindell some lawyer just runs up to you real quick

46:23.240 --> 46:28.120
And he's like, okay. I just need to give you a quick interview. You're gonna need to sign this statement

46:29.080 --> 46:30.520
Exactly. Yeah

46:30.520 --> 46:35.240
um, so and I also think that mike can't be super happy about this either because

46:35.240 --> 46:40.360
He's been in the trump orbit in one of these people for a while now

46:41.000 --> 46:45.240
If he wanted to be on info wars, he would have been on there long ago long ago

46:45.320 --> 46:49.320
He would have been on there when roger was on and when the good days were going

46:49.320 --> 46:55.320
Yep, and the reason that he didn't is because obviously no one wants to be on info wars. It's the last resort

46:56.280 --> 46:59.160
Even for these shit head grifters for the my pillow guy

46:59.160 --> 47:07.000
Yes, this is slumming it mike lindell is doing this because he's not allowed on those other channels anymore because he's being sued

47:07.080 --> 47:12.200
by smartmatic and dominion and those claims are all he wants to talk about and those those

47:12.920 --> 47:18.280
Networks just won't let him uh spread that shit. So where can he info wars?

47:18.520 --> 47:23.960
Alex is the last person who will let him the tv networks are better lawyers than mike lindell's lawyers

47:23.960 --> 47:29.640
Because they're the only people who are like no we can't have you talking about your case on air

47:29.720 --> 47:31.880
We're going to learn that mike actually just lost his lawyer

47:32.680 --> 47:35.320
That makes sense a little bit later in this interview. That sounds right

47:35.640 --> 47:38.760
So alex before he gets into the actual interview with mike lindell

47:39.480 --> 47:42.360
He's gonna he's gonna talk a little bit about how the last hour was pretty heavy

47:43.160 --> 47:44.760
And it was yes

47:44.760 --> 47:47.400
I got pretty wound up last hour got into some heavy issues

47:47.400 --> 47:51.400
But i'm just telling you where the globalists want to take us if they succeed they're going to fail

47:51.400 --> 47:53.560
But as we get mike lindell back on and ready

47:54.120 --> 47:57.480
Please remember we're lister supported and I thank you all and you're amazing

47:58.200 --> 48:01.720
Uh, just like they tried to bankrupt and shut down mike lindell. They tried to shut us down

48:01.880 --> 48:05.800
But thanks for your support. We're still on air and still more effective than ever

48:05.800 --> 48:11.000
So we're introducing the brand new mega immune support supplements fun. Jesus. Yep

48:11.640 --> 48:16.760
Oh if you add mega you're you're you've already admitted you're done, you know the moment you're like

48:16.760 --> 48:22.360
You know the moment you're like, this is our mega health supplement. You're making bullshit up very much. So yeah

48:22.680 --> 48:29.000
It's it's interesting to me though the way that alex spends an hour saying we're all dead. Everybody's dead. Fuck it

48:29.080 --> 48:31.000
We're gonna die. It doesn't matter

48:31.000 --> 48:34.920
We're all dead and then he sort of tries to walk it back there with like

48:35.160 --> 48:38.440
I'm, just talking about what the globalists want to do if they win they're gonna lose

48:39.080 --> 48:41.080
Like as if to undo

48:41.560 --> 48:43.560
All that he did in the last hour

48:43.560 --> 48:49.160
Yep, that hour could have been anything else than anything anything else. Yep. It was meaningless

48:49.240 --> 48:52.440
It's a completely meaningless hour of just a guy

48:53.320 --> 48:56.760
Trying to get people scared. Yeah, and and hopeless

48:57.720 --> 48:59.000
I mean

48:59.000 --> 48:59.960
Okay

48:59.960 --> 49:01.080
so

49:01.080 --> 49:04.040
What he did was spend an hour telling us that we're all gonna die

49:04.680 --> 49:11.720
And then his way of apology is like this is only if they win and they're going to lose

49:11.720 --> 49:16.840
Now that first hour would be valuable if you were giving me steps on how to make them lose

49:17.160 --> 49:21.080
Uh, right because you you're giving me the intense fear

49:22.280 --> 49:25.400
Oh, well, maybe yep. You know what? Never mind. You're right

49:25.400 --> 49:30.120
That hour was incredibly important to letting me know why I need to buy those mega supplements

49:30.120 --> 49:34.200
That's the that's the end. That's the destination of the walk that we were on. Oh, I'm so tired

49:34.440 --> 49:40.280
That was a long walk to get there. You think you're tired. I do. Mike Lindell's tired. He works a lot. I believe that

49:40.280 --> 49:45.480
Uh, Mike, great to finally get you on air with us. Thank you so much. Sincere. Oh, thanks for having me on

49:46.120 --> 49:48.680
You're a busy guy working 20 hours a day. Wow

49:49.800 --> 49:55.640
Yeah, I just landed. I'm in Michigan today. I've been going all around this country trying to get

49:56.440 --> 50:02.280
This election pulled down and we will get it pulled down. So we're gonna 20 hour days trying to overturn the election

50:02.280 --> 50:06.040
What are you doing for 20 hours? That's a really good question

50:06.040 --> 50:11.560
I don't know what I don't know what what amount of work there is to be done on this front. I guess writing letters?

50:12.120 --> 50:13.320
It could be

50:13.320 --> 50:19.880
Um, traveling to another place and then writing letters? I guess there's no like time limit on talking shit. That's true

50:21.160 --> 50:26.200
That's probably what he's doing. I mean does does it qualify as work if no one's around to hear you talk shit?

50:26.200 --> 50:32.680
Is that our new like if a tree falls in the forest if Mike Lindell is telling you about the stolen election and no one's around to hear it?

50:32.680 --> 50:36.200
If you're your own boss, you can count that as on the clock Alex. I think so. Yeah

50:37.080 --> 50:42.520
Tax-deductible at least. Mike Lindell's got this argument about overturning the election, right? Sure. And

50:43.480 --> 50:45.480
some arguments

50:45.480 --> 50:52.920
Maybe they're three of a kind. Maybe they're a full house. Uh-huh. Not Mike's argument. No. Royal flush. Okay. All right

50:52.920 --> 50:58.120
It's been a pretty amazing because it's like you're sitting here with a royal flush in a poker game

50:58.120 --> 51:03.480
And we're just waiting to play it. We're gonna probably, you know, we're gonna bring it to the Supreme Court in July

51:04.040 --> 51:10.040
As a full warrant. Oh, that's fast. It's just a matter of getting the word out to every every person in this country

51:10.440 --> 51:15.960
Getting it out there. So the Supreme Court has pressure to accept it. Not a fucking chance

51:15.960 --> 51:23.320
The Supreme Court has pressure to accept this case. Not a fucking chance. No. Yep. No

51:23.320 --> 51:30.680
This seems to be the theme of what he's trying to get to is like we need to get everybody on board with this

51:30.680 --> 51:32.680
So the Supreme Court can't reject it

51:33.240 --> 51:38.440
I think he probably isn't stupid enough to think that that's really how things would work

51:38.760 --> 51:44.040
I think he knows that by the time people realize that the Supreme Court's not going to take this case up

51:44.040 --> 51:46.040
We still will have fleeced them

51:46.040 --> 51:53.320
Tends to be the case. It does seem like you are always moving the date where we're gonna get that royal flush up

51:53.320 --> 51:56.840
Oh, yeah, you got I mean you got to play, you know, you're never you're never pushing it back

51:56.840 --> 51:59.560
You're never like hey we're on the date

51:59.560 --> 52:05.800
You're always like and now next month we'll get there and you know what the the honest-to-god thing is that if he can get this

52:05.800 --> 52:07.240
In front of the Supreme Court

52:07.240 --> 52:11.160
Things are gonna move real fast. That's probably true. Things are going great

52:11.160 --> 52:16.600
I couldn't be happier the way things are going in our country right now really said before our president be back

52:16.840 --> 52:19.400
I said August I could be off by a month or two

52:20.200 --> 52:25.960
This you've been quarterbacking the resistance and I believe in you and I know you've been behind the scenes

52:25.960 --> 52:28.680
I've talked a lot of folks you've been working with. I'll leave it at that but

52:29.800 --> 52:34.760
President Trump our real president in now in his second term with with the Chinese agent

52:35.960 --> 52:38.360
Biden there this weekend as you know

52:38.360 --> 52:41.720
He came out in the video saying oh, we're gonna take back the Senate

52:42.280 --> 52:46.920
We're gonna take back the house and the White House sooner than you think and I've talked

52:47.800 --> 52:52.760
With Trump he is really excited and he believes when the evidence comes out. There's a strategy

52:53.320 --> 52:55.320
So wow, tell us about that

52:55.560 --> 52:56.600
boy

52:56.600 --> 52:58.600
Trump's gonna be president again in August

52:58.920 --> 53:04.920
That is a lot sooner than I was expecting. Yeah, I I that was sooner than I planned for specifically

53:04.920 --> 53:11.480
This is such a goddamn roller coaster. It's like the first hour is we're all gonna die and then Mike Lindell comes in

53:11.480 --> 53:15.320
It's like no Trump will be president again within a few months. Yeah

53:15.960 --> 53:22.440
Yeah, what? Yeah, the globalist plan seems very easy to sidestep how just completely

53:22.680 --> 53:29.080
How are you supposed to feel if you're a listener to this show? It's so it's so untethered. You're dead in a year. Boo

53:30.040 --> 53:32.040
President Trump. Yay

53:32.040 --> 53:36.040
This is just how you go through this broadcast just a constant

53:36.760 --> 53:40.280
Stream of look I'm bipolar and this is fucking with my yeah

53:40.280 --> 53:44.360
If I took any of this seriously as being like it all

53:44.920 --> 53:47.720
Based in reality. I would have a very difficult time

53:48.520 --> 53:51.080
Emotionally surfing these waves. Yeah. Yeah

53:51.080 --> 53:57.240
Yeah, no, one of the big things that I try and do to cope is is like lower the amount of intense emotional stimuli that

53:57.240 --> 53:59.320
I receive I believe if I listen to you

53:59.320 --> 54:03.400
One of these broadcast I would be running through the street screaming. That's why the

54:03.800 --> 54:09.960
Delegation of labor is the way it yes, it makes it only way this could work. Yeah, so once the Supreme Court

54:10.600 --> 54:15.560
In July gets a hold of this case. They're gonna rule nine to zero

54:17.960 --> 54:19.960
You understand me

54:20.920 --> 54:24.680
Unanimous I really think the best you're going for is five to four there

54:24.680 --> 54:28.200
I don't think Roberts is gonna side with you guys nine zero

54:29.240 --> 54:34.120
When that when the Supreme Court looks at this it's not subjective evidence

54:34.120 --> 54:38.200
So it's gonna be nine zero not eight to one seven to two

54:38.360 --> 54:42.760
It has to be nine zero because this is not this isn't subjective evidence

54:43.000 --> 54:48.600
So they're gonna pull this down and now and now but everybody needs to know there's a couple other things

54:48.600 --> 54:57.240
One is there were many down tickets to that were flipped especially with you know senators like John James both senators in Georgia

54:58.200 --> 55:06.840
Jason Lewis from Minnesota many congressmen many I mean this wasn't just at the presidential level and and and in our country

55:07.080 --> 55:13.320
I want everybody to know this there's no there's no statute of limitations on this everyone says come on Mike

55:13.320 --> 55:20.520
That's too hard to believe. Well, let me tell you something. Uh, but you believe we've been in this position a year and a half ago. No

55:21.320 --> 55:26.360
So and but I will tell you this every election in the United States is history

55:26.680 --> 55:30.440
if you find out there was a crime committed after the fact or

55:31.000 --> 55:35.080
That the other person won in any way. Let's say it was just a mistake whatever it was

55:35.320 --> 55:38.280
They put the person that won back in office

55:38.280 --> 55:45.020
They put the person that won back in office. And if there was a crime committed by the by anyone else they get arrested

55:45.720 --> 55:52.520
That's right. Let's use the sports analogy that's happened hundreds of times prominently thousands of times in smaller cases where you find out the other team

55:53.480 --> 55:54.760
cheated cheated

55:54.760 --> 55:59.720
So the other team cheated they then forfeited and then it's given to who they actually cheated against

55:59.880 --> 56:04.680
Do you notice how alex used a sports metaphor instead of an example from the world of politics?

56:04.680 --> 56:08.460
It does seem like a sports metaphor has more opportunities

56:09.400 --> 56:15.000
Yeah, like if you're in a boxing match and it later comes out that your opponent was on the juice or something like that

56:15.080 --> 56:19.720
You might you know that you might end up having the other person forfeit. Yes, that's true

56:20.840 --> 56:23.400
I'm hard pressed to come up with examples from

56:25.000 --> 56:32.120
The history of our courts, I mean there have been instances where there were really close races sure and somebody who had won

56:32.120 --> 56:37.320
Uh after a recount, you know, you they had uh flipped the winner sure or something like that

56:37.560 --> 56:43.800
Yeah, I don't know if I can think of any example of what they're talking about now off the top of my head

56:44.920 --> 56:49.420
I I would I would say the thing that's most surprising to me about this whole conversation

56:49.800 --> 56:55.960
Is the idea that mike lindell was talking to somebody about this and was like we've got an open and shut case

56:56.280 --> 57:01.020
It's all done and that person responded with no it's out of the statute of limitations

57:01.020 --> 57:06.220
Right, right. And then mike lindell says there's no statute of limitations and this person goes

57:06.860 --> 57:08.220
What?

57:08.220 --> 57:15.100
Yeah, I can't believe that in that case in that case. I'm gonna relitigate. I think this is the way to do it

57:15.260 --> 57:17.660
So like that's six. Was it 68?

57:18.140 --> 57:23.340
Yeah, yeah, let's go back to the beginning. Yeah, I don't think tj won that election

57:23.420 --> 57:27.340
That's what i'm gonna go out there right now. I think he stole it and you know, it's fucking awesome about that

57:27.340 --> 57:31.580
Too you undo one of those past elections and it throws you all gotta do them all

57:31.740 --> 57:37.180
You gotta start all over it throws everything into chaos because what if it was a two-term president totally then the second term

57:38.300 --> 57:42.220
Yeah, yeah, the whole country has to reset from the beginning

57:43.100 --> 57:46.620
We dig up george washington and we get him back in there. Yeah

57:48.780 --> 57:53.420
I honestly think that that might be a better solution to this fanciful nonsense

57:53.420 --> 57:58.880
Like I mean, this isn't a better solution up george washington. No, not exactly but sort of yeah metaphorically

57:59.420 --> 58:04.860
If mike lindell were to be let me be clear really clear. Sure. None of this is gonna happen

58:04.860 --> 58:07.100
Yeah, of course not if he were to have

58:07.720 --> 58:15.180
Incontrovertible evidence that this election was stolen by foreign powers or whatever sure and he gets it to the supreme court and they vote nine zero

58:15.500 --> 58:17.020
in july

58:17.020 --> 58:21.020
I think the answer isn't put trump back in office. It's right a new constitution

58:21.020 --> 58:25.580
Yeah, if our country has failed no complaints figure something better out

58:26.300 --> 58:30.460
Frankly, we should already be starting the new constitution process as we speak

58:31.020 --> 58:35.180
You know, but let's just take this country like an etch a sketch totally

58:35.420 --> 58:40.140
We'll hold on to some of the good stuff. Sure some of the protections and rights. Yeah. Yeah, but

58:41.580 --> 58:44.540
Anyway, mike lindell is being sued by dominion

58:44.700 --> 58:50.220
I would even go so far as to rewrite that 13th amendment to include prisoners and not uh, you know

58:50.220 --> 58:53.980
Just be like slaves are bad unless they committed a crime one time me

58:54.620 --> 59:01.180
So mike lindell is being sued by dominion and smartmatic, uh over claims, uh about their

59:01.740 --> 59:04.860
Their computers and their technology being used. Uh

59:05.640 --> 59:12.140
Intentionally to rig an election. Yeah. Yeah, that's a bit that's a big one. I think he's being sued for uh, it's in the billions

59:12.780 --> 59:18.780
Yep. Yep. Yep. I think punitive damages would suggest that's a good idea. Now. There's something you may not have heard

59:18.780 --> 59:25.500
What's that? Mike lindell is also suing them. I have not heard that. Yes. What crimes have they committed?

59:25.660 --> 59:29.980
Um, you gotta watch his documentary. Oh, I can't do that. I can't do that. I'm sorry

59:30.380 --> 59:36.460
We'll talk about it here in a minute. I made it. But anyway, um, he's suing them and there's a minor setback and that his lawyer quit

59:37.420 --> 59:38.440
and

59:38.440 --> 59:40.440
apparently

59:40.460 --> 59:47.600
Apparently jordan, this is cancel culture. Oh, okay now last thursday. This is really key. I sued dominion

59:47.600 --> 59:52.000
And smartmatic I threw them in there too because they're all in cahoots together

59:52.480 --> 01:00:00.020
And for two billion dollars, you didn't hear about that probably in the news, but I even put their lawyers as co-conspirators

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:07.280
I put down their lawyers because their lawyers have served papers either lawsuits or threatening letters to over

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:14.400
200 people in this country and and news outlets including fox and whoever so everybody lives in fear

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:20.400
Of being sued. Well when I did that last thursday, I had to get a local council in minnesota

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:27.360
I got so many lawyers. I don't even know their names, but I got a local council in minnesota to serve them in minneapolis federal court

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:33.040
This law firm said yes, that's great. We'll do it. So we did it they signed up

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:39.840
They were attacked on thursday night by bots and trolls and email and the left and the communism

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:45.280
Who knows who all attacked them? So then on friday they fired the one of their lawyers

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:50.240
And said they did that they blamed it on that lawyer for even taking mike lindale's case

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:58.080
So they could get out there out from under the attack. It's just more cancel culture. It's cancel culture man. Oh boy

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.160
it just

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:04.640
Just seems like maybe they the law firm was more like whoops. Uh

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:11.440
I don't think the billable hours is worth this. Yes. Yeah, this is going to really be a drag

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:17.280
Yeah, we should uh, we thought we could go under the radar and just bill mike lindale for money

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:21.120
Oh, we looked at mike lindale's books and granted he's

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:27.360
Bizarrely rich for someone who has a pillow company. Um, but not that rich

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:32.080
We can let him go. Yeah. Yeah. So anyway, he's got this new documentary

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:36.800
He has like these these documentaries have been like absolute proof. Sure absolute collusion

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:42.560
Sure, and now this new one is called absolute nine zero. Oh boy in honor of the supreme court. Yes

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:49.840
Yeah, yeah, this is the cyber evidence. Everybody needs to watch this video. It's absolutely nine zero

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:56.880
This is the cyber proof against dominion against all this it shows it shows china attacking our country

01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:02.560
What they did so I like to give everyone a fair chance to be heard sure I went ahead and I watched this film

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:06.640
And I want to tell you this right off the bat. I was not convinced. Oh, no

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:11.760
I I think your standards of evidence are a little bit higher than the supreme courts though, dan

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:18.400
There's nothing persuasive in the film and it's honestly mostly just uh, mike talking into his phone like he's recording on his phone

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.200
His ear pods are in

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:24.320
He's talking to an alleged cyber expert whose face and voice is on the screen

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:28.720
He's talking to an alleged cyber expert whose face and voice are distorted. It is an anonymous person

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:31.280
Who knows what the fuck he is got to be anonymous

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:38.160
So what it boils down to is that mike is claiming that he has what's called packet captures or the raw information from these computers

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:40.880
That proves that votes were being changed on election night

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:45.620
He shows these long scrolls of numbers over and over again in the documentary

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:52.720
As if to insist that even though you can't read this code. It's so definitive that trump is going to be president again in no time

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:58.320
Mike does say multiple times that these scrolls of numbers are actually the packet captures that they're working from

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:02.160
That's a problem the washington post among others

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:08.800
Pointed out that the scrolls of numbers are not packet captures and they're not even in the right format that that information would be found

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:14.960
In this sort of data that's transmitted over the internet is generally in binary. Whereas this is all hexadecimal code

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:18.960
So it just doesn't even make sense what the claims that are being made

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:22.800
That's going to be a tough hurdle for him to uh jump at the supreme court

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:29.040
But if he's got this kind of proof, I don't know the post took a look at some of the code and translated it into readable

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:36.340
Uh letters mike lindell is a piece of shit. It appears to be the pennsylvania voter roll, which is publicly available information

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:39.600
Yeah, okay

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:45.120
It might be a safe assumption to believe that this scroll of numbers is a dumb prop and this pixelated cyber expert is someone

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:52.160
Doing some fun role-playing and this is just a bunch of bullshit. That sounds likely. Yep. Oh, man. Mm-hmm

01:03:53.760 --> 01:04:01.040
There's an inverse relationship between confidence in a set of numbers that a pillow person cannot read and uh truth

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:03.360
Behind those numbers. Yeah

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:08.000
So alex, I don't know what it was. Like I think mike lindell was a little delayed

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:10.720
And so when he was like, oh we're gonna talk to the my pillow guy

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:16.800
It might have been a situation where it's like he's late sure for the interview and so like maybe that was what was frustrating him

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:19.040
Because alex is saying a number of positive things

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:26.080
He's being he's being pretty polite and positive and putting up with some clearly nonsensical things that might just be a good scene partner

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:30.160
Yeah, and I think what he's doing is he's chasing a contract that's not going to come. Yeah

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:34.800
It's a little too late the cash cow for mike lindell getting some of his money

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:40.340
Is a little bit in the past like a lot of those like oan or right side broadcasting

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:44.000
They could get any money they wanted from him. I'm sure you know

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:49.920
We saw those uh those rallies that were just like the coverage for these networks were entirely sponsored

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:56.160
Yeah, and like I think that alex maybe would want some of that. I mean I would if I were him

01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:00.000
It's easy money. Yeah, I think when I think it's too late

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.680
He's getting sued for millions or billions of dollars when it comes to principles versus gaining money

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:08.720
I think alex is going to go for gaining money every single time

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:15.440
But that money just won't be there for long. Yeah, I think it's too late. He's uh, he's fishing in a dry well

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:21.920
Um, but he does say some nice things about mike and uh then accidentally a my pillow commercial breaks out

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Oh, no, my listeners still love trump, but I love trump. I want to run for president again

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.960
He is our president. I want to run for the speaker house, whatever he wants

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:35.760
But from a listener's view on the street people started asking more often. Do you know mike lindell?

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:38.640
Instead of you know trump because it's an example

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:41.920
People want action

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:47.840
They want somebody to stand up and I know trump had to lick his wounds get ready totally cut off a few months to

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:51.360
Exercise lose weight trump's fucking great. He's giving speeches

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:54.880
The threat to arrest his whole family would set up bogus stuff. He doesn't back down

01:05:54.880 --> 01:06:02.480
I'm, not criticizing trump when I hold up mike lindell. I'm saying he's the example of putting it all on the line

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:07.200
Uh and and being there so I know you don't want to bring this up i'm bringing up right now. How do people

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:10.640
Support with all the attacks you're under fighting the globalist

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:16.240
How do people support the work you're doing because I know you're separate from my pillow with your your political action

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:20.880
But how do people do that so they can buy the pillows and then finance what you're doing?

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:25.360
Finance what you're doing. Wait, I thought you I thought that my pillow was separate from the political stuff user

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:27.360
But it finances the political stuff

01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:29.840
That's suspicious

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:34.400
Well, you know that the best way is because you know dominion attacked my employees soon

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:40.640
We've lost all our retailers. So people have really stepped up but you could you could use the promo code mike today

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:48.640
Just use mike and you can save up to 66 on all our products. That's a lot. This goes on a while, too

01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:54.240
This this this ad is not short. Mike has created a new bed that he plugs. Sure. Sure

01:06:55.360 --> 01:07:00.800
Oh boy. Yep. I want I need to sue for something for alex

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:07.840
I need to sue for like extreme gaslighting for alex insisting to me that trump licked his wounds by exercising

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:12.640
Yeah, he was doing set ups. I want I there needs to be punitive damages for that

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:18.960
Yeah, something because you can't do that. That's just wrong. Carpe donkdom is gonna put out a uh,

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:24.240
compilation of like uh, uh set to eye of the tiger of trump like boxing

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.240
Show me show me one heaven

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:31.920
Meat hanging in a in a in a locker show me an example of him working out one picture. I don't know

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:37.360
I don't know. I just think this is more masculine hero worship nonsense totally. That's so disgusting

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:41.920
So I think that this next clip is one of the weirder things that i've heard happen on the show

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:47.200
Ever. Um, you know, there's there's there's things that are bizarre ideas that are bizarre. Sure

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:52.160
And then there are things that just happen that i'm like how did that happen? That's weird

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:57.200
And this is one of those it's the latter thing. It's not a weird idea. All right. I just don't know how this happened

01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:03.040
Okay, we're gonna do what i'm gonna do in I mean now see on your show right now as we speak

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:09.920
Um in july i'm gonna get a place, uh some big location. I don't care

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:15.040
Michael and l stay there. I gotta you know about tv already. I got hard breaks satellites stay there

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:19.600
We'll come right back in a few minutes. I want to hear this big announcement. Alex almost never does that

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:22.320
He runs into the brakes all the time

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:25.840
Whether it's like I will skip this break that used to do that

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:31.360
Yeah, but even multiple times on this episode he's just in the middle of a sentence and it goes to break. That's so great

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:35.920
Why would he interrupt mike lindell in the middle of the big announcement?

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:41.360
That's the best time to interrupt somebody i'm gonna announce people on to on this show

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:44.800
Right now i'm sorry. We gotta go to break shit

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:51.360
You're breaking the flow a little bit. I guess I do understand it, you know from a presentation standpoint

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:54.960
You would want it to be clean. Yeah, you want the full announcement all at once

01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:58.640
You don't want to announce the first half and then we'll be back at break and then you announce the second

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:03.840
No, no, that makes sense. Yeah, but not for alex. No, not for alex. No, not for alex

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:10.400
No, and I would uh, I would assume that most professionals would know that a big announcement was about to happen on their show

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:12.160
if you

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.160
if you were going to

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:20.240
Also, I mean just from a professional standpoint as an interviewee if you're going to make a big announcement

01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:24.560
You should know if it's going to be broken up. Yeah. Yeah. Oh boy. Yeah

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:27.040
So anyway, are you ready here to the announcement? Let's do it

01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:31.200
You were you we were going to break you had a big announcement. What is the big announcement?

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:35.520
Yeah, well, this is just part of the plan, but the big announcement is um

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:43.680
If all the cyber evidence I have all this stuff from the day before the election the election the two days after all those packets

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:50.240
They're called packet captures everybody since I went public with that in on an absolutely nine zero

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:54.640
I got all kinds of companies from all over the united states

01:09:54.640 --> 01:10:02.640
Cyber companies that are cyber white hat hackers cyber companies said hey, we'd like to look at that and validate that pay us in bitcoin

01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:08.160
Sometime in july i'm gonna get either. I don't care if it's us big stadium

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:15.680
I don't care how big it has to be i'm gonna invite all of these white cyber, um experts in

01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:21.120
And I want to televise all of them can be there the whole world can watch

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:26.160
The whole world can watch and I don't care if there's a hundred of these companies there here it is

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:33.280
And I want them all to say on on on tb and everywhere. Wow. There it is hundred percent. There it is. There it is

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:38.160
It's like showing a royal flush in a poker game and everyone going does everybody see it?

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:39.680
Hello

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:45.200
That election's coming down. Um, i'm not gonna hold my breath on uh this event happening. Yeah

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:47.760
I would argue it's less like

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:53.120
Showing people a royal flush while you're playing a game of poker and more like instead of having cards

01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:55.760
You throw a dead horse on the table and you're like see

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:57.920
I won

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:03.680
Well, technically he would have something to show them. I guess it would be more like he's got a two. Yeah

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:09.040
Um the death card from a tarot deck naturally the instruction card, right?

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:12.320
um

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:17.600
That nolan ryan's, uh, rookie baseball card and a piece of non. Yes, exactly. Yeah

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:21.120
Royal flush, baby. What kind of looks like cards?

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:23.520
uh

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:24.800
Yeah

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:30.640
I don't know. I I would love for this to happen though. I do think it would be chaotic on a level

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:35.220
It would rival the uh, the the landscaping

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:37.760
four seasons

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:40.080
Yeah, yeah, that would be pretty delightful

01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:46.080
I was just thinking like I wonder if even if a ransomware company if he would even notice if his

01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:51.120
Computers were locked and he can't get into his business software unless he paid 10 million in bitcoin

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:53.200
He'd be like, oh no

01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:59.360
And then just record on his phone like he wouldn't even fucking care. Yeah. Yeah, or it would be cancel culture

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:04.000
Yes, it would be cancel culture. So mike's got one last little thing, uh to say here and uh,

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:09.360
This is where I you know, it's kind of getting a little bit worried that maybe mike is a bit of a christian zealot

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.360
In the same vein as alex

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:14.240
Everybody needs to pray. That's the number one thing for mike

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:17.520
And and everything he's doing

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:24.400
Yeah, thank you. And I thank everybody for your prayers and I believe I do believe that we're in the greatest revival ever

01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:27.840
People aren't looking for hope unless things are bad we get through this

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:33.120
It's going to be once again one one nation under god, but it's the biggest revival for jesus in history

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:37.840
Everybody right now is just they're praying and we are our prayers are answered

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:44.080
They have been answered over and over here. Remember god's got his hand in all of this. This is on god's timing

01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:47.680
Can you imagine if this would have been flipped back in uh, december?

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:52.640
You might have had a you know, democrats not believing that they really that it really got stole

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:58.800
Well now when the supreme court pulls this down those nine supreme court justices are going to be heroes

01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:02.960
They're protecting our country from china and whether you're a democrat or republican

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:06.640
It's going to be a united and as long as your message gets out we win

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:10.160
So, I don't know. I don't know if you quite grasped what he was saying there at the end

01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:15.920
He's saying that like if if trump had been put back in like right after the election or whatever

01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:20.800
Yeah, democrats would have been really mad. No, but now democrats all know the election was

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:24.640
Was a scam. Well, we all watched absolutely nine zero. Yes

01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:27.040
so and so now the we will

01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:33.920
We will carry the supreme court justices out of chambers on our shoulders chanting and cheering. Thank you

01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:41.040
Thank you. Thank you three and a half more years of trump three and a half more years. I think he gets time served

01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:43.760
I disagree, sir

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:45.920
I have to take that up with mike

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:48.960
I'll take it to the supreme court

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:55.840
So mike lindale takes off and alex has another guest on uh for another the last hour. Uh-huh

01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:59.840
And uh, it's a it's a fellow we know uh, he's a rat fucker

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:05.280
Oh boy, he's uh, here we go. Mary prankster. All right. All right this bastard

01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:10.880
Uh, roger stone is back and he wants to talk about the good old days

01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:14.720
Those were the days that he would like to talk about I assume yeah

01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:21.120
There was a time when both parties just had two different governing philosophies a more liberal philosophy a more conservative philosophy

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:28.960
On finances on fiscal matters on foreign policy matters. This is no longer the case you have now we want to overthrow

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:33.200
We want to overthrow democracy america first party under donald trump

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:40.400
And you have the other party that has been completely co-opted by the red chinese. I think this is abundantly clear

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:46.720
Their party will not denounce radical islam. What think about that the party of harry truman?

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:49.040
What?

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:52.960
Why is truman in here truman has nothing to do with radical islam?

01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:59.920
I don't connect with you generally. I wasn't like hey, it wasn't like radical islam defeats. Truman is the

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:02.720
Headline he was holding up. You don't know about dewy

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:06.160
Um

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:08.160
yeah, I I think I

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:09.280
um

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:13.520
I don't know. I lose patience for people who make these two arguments together

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:16.880
They like there was a time when both parties loved the country

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:24.080
Sure, and now we have all coalesced around a charismatic leader with a america first slogan and then the other people

01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:30.960
Everybody else are co-opted by the comments. Yes, exactly. Yes. It is us against them with no middle ground

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:34.720
Yes, but oh I miss the days when everyone used to be able to do middle ground

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:39.040
We used to be able to do middle ground all the time when I was working for nixon the main thing

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:41.120
That we did in our administration

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:47.840
Reaching out to the other aisle. Yeah, that's what we did. Definitely and when I was working with reagan

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:55.280
We reached out across the aisle to destroy those unions. That was our plan. Yeah, and what?

01:15:55.760 --> 01:16:00.800
Jesus christ, so roger has a belief and that is that trump is the greatest president since lincoln

01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:08.880
He is the greatest president since abraham lincoln I agree maybe since washington, so let me ask you this

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:14.800
What do we do then? Because we're just sitting here watching the country destroyed and I understand I don't want a civil war

01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:17.200
They're trying to start one. Anyways, what do we do then?

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:23.280
But you can go to roger stone's plan to save america.com. That's a long url

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:30.400
That's a little that's not happening buddy. No, you gotta trim that up

01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:34.160
Get a bitly or something

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:41.680
Don't have a website that requires an apostrophe. That's what I that's all i'm saying. It's too confusing for people you're trying to target

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.400
Especially for those people. Yeah

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:46.960
Please check out my website

01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:53.060
Www.rogerstone's got some wonderful ideas that will have very much helped this country get back on track.com

01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:00.560
Oh god, I went to this website and it's just one of these

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:05.760
Uh-huh. It's just one of these awesome things that just the people on the right do this all the time

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:10.320
They're so good at this and that is just it's a donation landing page. Yep

01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:15.680
And I have a plan that will save america put in your email address and i'll send it to you

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:20.160
Got it. Just try to build up an email list roger's trying to get back on his hustle. Jesus

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:24.560
Yeah, so this is his uh transition back into being able to direct market to people. Yeah

01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:27.440
Um, so good good good on him. Yeah, great

01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:31.600
Yeah, I bet he could take it. I bet he could get a job working for greenwald at this point

01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:37.440
Working on that sub stack. That might be that might be a good way for stone to go greenwald and stone. Yeah

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:41.200
The new well manifold went down

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:47.280
So greenwald's the next obvious choice right get uh get at water in there and you gotta you got a consulting firm

01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:48.080
Oh, man

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:51.280
I wonder if greenwald would know how shitty he's become if I

01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:55.840
Really told him that he and roger stone are equal now. That'd be bad

01:17:55.840 --> 01:18:01.520
So you may have some ideas about greenwald, but roger's got some ideas about fauci

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:04.640
Hitler, okay

01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:06.640
All right. Fauci will be remembered

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:12.000
As hitler that sounds strange. I think tony fauci is going to go down with adolf hitler

01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:18.720
Joseph stalin and chairman mao is one of the great mass murderers of all time and those who say what are you talking about?

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:24.080
Millions of people have taken this vaccination have had no reaction to which I say. Yeah

01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:26.080
Ah

01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:34.080
Well, I have been roundly outsmarted roger stone shit I didn't think of that

01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:38.480
That's certainly not an argument that

01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:43.920
Can't be made about everything. No, no, no, no that one. No, nope

01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:52.880
Very dumb, how about uh, how about we just apply that to literally any and all arguments with roger stone from now on just say

01:18:52.880 --> 01:19:00.240
Yet. Yeah, not yet. Oh, no, they'll never kill trump. Not yet. Oh now you've been defeated, sir

01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:08.000
Oh, yeah, fuck off. So, uh, one of the big things about mike lindell's interview was that trump is going to be president again

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:13.040
Imminently. Yes. He's going to be put right back in that august maybe a little bit later couple months

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:16.080
Maybe couple months max august. Maybe i'm a little bit off couple months

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:22.080
You never know how long the supreme court is going to take with arguments, you know, totally and there's literally no

01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:28.720
Uh protocol for reinstating a president. No, I don't think we've ever done that one before so I

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:32.880
I would think that there might be conversations that would last quite a while about that

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:39.840
Um, but yeah a couple months anyway, it would have been funny if after harding they were like listen

01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:42.800
I mean, this is too soon. We're just gonna redo it

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:46.080
So that's mike's big thing

01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:48.560
Now roger is on right after

01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:55.440
No, he's not into it. Okay now I should also tell you just as a way to give a little bit of context for this

01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:57.360
this next uh

01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:03.440
Uh clip roger his wife apparently has just recently been diagnosed with cancer and that's awful

01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:07.600
Yeah, I hope the best for her, uh recovery that sucks. However

01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:11.040
Alex takes that information

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.460
And tries to turn roger's wife's diagnosis

01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:20.340
Into a vaccine talking point. Wow, and if I were roger, I would be furious

01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:27.620
Well, first of all, look I have great respect for mike lindell who's doing an extraordinary job and spending his own money putting his

01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:33.540
His mouth his money where his mouth is try to undercover the election fraud in all these states parenthesis

01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:39.940
I would never do that. Listen, I make the subjective judgment that even then turning over the election will be very difficult

01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:43.540
I really hope to be wrong. I hope mike lindell is right

01:20:43.540 --> 01:20:47.860
I hope the president's instinct is correct at the moment. I've got to be honest with you

01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:55.380
I'm, so distracted with my wife's cancer treatments and the tsunami of contradictory medical advice that we're trying to sort through

01:20:55.780 --> 01:21:03.460
And the millions and millions of phds and doctors and professionals as well as holistic and homeopathic healers

01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:08.500
Who've contacted us trying to help us? It's heartwarming. It really is but it's also

01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:14.580
Overwhelming it is. Hey roger. What do you make of so many people that get the inoculation and get cancer in a few months?

01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:21.140
Uh, that's what all these scientists are saying. It's doing i've got a new article out of florida out of palm beach close to where you live

01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:24.980
I don't get into your own private life. I don't know if you made this public or not. You didn't take the vaccine

01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:28.420
But did anybody else, you know take the vaccine recently? They just got cancer

01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:35.940
Well, uh, no, but I can tell you that uh that my uh, a member of my family did take it not my wife

01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:39.720
A member of my family did take it not my wife just disgusting

01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:42.580
Just absolutely disgusting

01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:47.460
No, uh, but I can tell you that you're a disgusting monster

01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:54.100
Uh that you have just decided to turn my wife's cancer diagnosis into a prop for your own bullshit

01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:59.700
And normally i'm fine with that but this is my fucking wife. We're talking about you asshole

01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:03.060
Yeah, I mean he's brought up, uh on this interview a couple times

01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:08.660
Like I wouldn't pull clips of it to to discuss because it's you know his private life and you know, sure

01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:13.860
That's very difficult. It's not what we do a loved one. Uh have uh have a medical condition like that

01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:17.540
And uh, he's brought it up a couple times and it seems like something that is

01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:24.020
You know kind of scary and something that is difficult to deal with for even for a slimy fuck like roger

01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:29.380
yeah, and I I would rather make fun of his terrible positions than

01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:33.220
A legitimate tragedy and pain that he's going through

01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:38.660
Yeah, so he's brought it up a number of times and for alex to now do that

01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:42.600
Is so insulting it is so exploitative

01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:48.420
It's because if alex is listening to him, he has to recognize that like this isn't

01:22:49.060 --> 01:22:54.180
Like roger's polonium poisoning right? Right. Right. This is actually real. This is real. Yeah. Yeah

01:22:55.460 --> 01:22:56.340
I mean

01:22:56.340 --> 01:22:59.940
Here's the thing. Here's the other hand I have for that which is just

01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:08.020
Roger and alex have both done this to so many people in the past where they've exploited their personal shit for their propaganda that it's like

01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:12.020
Hey, you live by the sword you die by the sword. Of course. This was going to happen

01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:16.260
I guess you know you can't roger can't feel insulted

01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:20.900
Without wrestling with his own behavior, I guess you know

01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:26.740
So I can feel insulted on his behalf because I haven't taken his wife's cancer and used it as a prop

01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:32.420
Nor have I taken anybody's cancer and used it as a prop. It's just low, you know, like it's low. It's low

01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:38.100
It's a real bummer. It's a it's a it's a it's a real real bummer to be sitting here

01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:44.500
I'm, like I hate both of these people but alex is really edging out in terms of who I hate more in this interaction

01:23:44.660 --> 01:23:50.100
Yep. Yep. I I can't I can't imagine what it would feel like to do that the way alex is doing that too like

01:23:50.100 --> 01:23:54.260
Uh, hey, this this article is from close to where you live

01:23:54.500 --> 01:24:00.580
There's all these people who are getting cancer after getting the shot. Did anybody you know who maybe just got cancer?

01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:04.580
Yep, like say it was your wife. It's such a leading question kind of thing

01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:08.820
It's like please use your use your wife's condition as a as a way

01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:13.700
To make my narratives work better for me to make money off of you're around cancer people now

01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:15.300
You go to the treatments all the time

01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:20.980
So you gotta know a bunch of people with cancer tell me which ones took the vaccine and then let's go turn that pain into

01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:27.140
Profit totally totally and my profit not yours, by the way. No, because nobody's gonna get to your dumb url you idiot

01:24:27.220 --> 01:24:31.220
Yeah, they're gonna put that apostrophe in and get lost exactly. It's never happening

01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:37.060
Yeah, so you have one last clip here and I I really do think that this is so indicative of like

01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:42.820
Present-day alex and why it's just this this shit's meaningless. It's just a bad person doing a bad job

01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:46.500
Uh, because you know at the beginning of the show, like I said, it's an hour of him

01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:50.660
Just talking about how everyone's dead. It just doesn't matter and here's what he says

01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:53.300
at the end of the show

01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:56.420
Sometimes I start the show the best of moods end up bad moods

01:24:56.420 --> 01:25:00.740
Sometimes I start the bad mood in a good mood as rob doodler in the hall was telling me earlier man

01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:02.740
You're in a good mood now you're in a bad mood throughout the show

01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:07.140
You know, I appreciate listeners that tune into this show because you're not looking for lies

01:25:07.220 --> 01:25:12.180
You're looking for truth and the truth hurts sometimes but we got to admit that truth to get through the bad and you know

01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:14.740
Make it a better world. So I appreciate you all going through this

01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:17.300
just like i'm doing it and

01:25:17.300 --> 01:25:23.140
so many days at the end of the show i've got like the most powerful stuff we had I haven't hit yet because

01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:27.380
I've already looked at it two or three times and it's already got me pissed

01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:32.820
Yeah, man, the news got him pissed so he can't cover the news can't do can't convey the information

01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:36.180
That is the information part of the information war but he can

01:25:36.180 --> 01:25:42.580
Uh, take his feelings and project them onto the audience and lash out like a little baby in a way that reduce

01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:46.660
releases endorphins or gets him feeling better

01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:52.100
Remember when he was yelling about how he had a migraine and then he yelled he called the pope this the devil and he felt

01:25:52.100 --> 01:25:58.660
Better. Yep. It's just that but with the audience. He's just he just needs to get his emotions out. Yeah. Yeah this like

01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:01.620
Yeah, this is I I think any good

01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:06.520
Acid therapist or psychologist would be able to correctly diagnose

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:12.040
The relationship alex has with his listeners as incredibly abusive parasitic

01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:17.720
Uh, I feel like what he just did and what we listen to of him telling me that everybody's gonna die

01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:24.440
And then him feeling better at the end of it and me being left alone with this feeling that is domestic violence

01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:29.400
I feel abused this is fucking bullshit. It is but it's it's

01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:34.600
You know, obviously it's not that bad because you and I at least know that he's full of shit

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:41.080
Sure, and it doesn't affect us in any way that we're taking what he says seriously, right? But like if you did

01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:43.800
You would be

01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:50.520
Being taken for a ride. Yeah, alex would be trying to make you feel his emotions and leave you holding the bag

01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:54.680
Yes, total of the bad emotions totally and that's just uh, not cool

01:26:54.680 --> 01:27:00.520
I am getting my bad out emotions out of me and giving them to you because you deal with them and

01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:06.840
That last clip gave me a little bit of a hint that maybe he's a little bit

01:27:07.540 --> 01:27:14.520
subconsciously aware that that's what he does could be a little bit which is gross and it could be that rob doo has

01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:21.800
Told him specifically and maybe that conversation with rob doo is him trying to be like alex. Yeah, you did it again. Yep

01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:28.440
So wow, what a fucked up. Jesus. I listened to this episode and there's something that's kind of like well, that's a

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.320
Intense psychodrama. Yeah, that's going on

01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:38.440
Yeah, obviously and and it's monumental that michael and elle the my pillow guy is on the show that's not happened before

01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:40.680
This is a meeting of the minds

01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:46.760
And trump's gonna be president again after a nine zero. No, I still don't think that's happening. I still don't think that's happening

01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:52.200
We will see we will see what yet yet. So but you know look

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.760
Looking at this in especially in juxtaposition with the 2003 stuff

01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:02.040
Like it doesn't feel like alex is taking his moods out in 2003

01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:08.600
It does not feel like he's just having a kind of uh lashing out at a microphone. Yeah, no

01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:11.480
And that's kind of why it's better

01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:18.840
You can't I mean there's just no way to view our time with alex as anything other than watching a man descend into madness, right?

01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:24.200
Like we're we're doing a it's apparently lucrative madness. I mean we're doing a

01:28:25.140 --> 01:28:27.720
27-year heart of darkness situation

01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:36.760
We're watching colonel kurtz, that's what we're doing. Yeah, maybe oh mr. Kurtz he dead

01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:44.920
And uh, alex is just a mess. Um, anyway, uh, this has been our adventure on june 10th

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:46.600
Yes, we'll be back

01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:51.240
It has been an adventure. It has been an adventure. We'll be back. But until then, uh, we have a website
