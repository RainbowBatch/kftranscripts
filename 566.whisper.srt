00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,920
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,040
knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,840
I have great respect for knowledgefight

knowledgefight

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,280
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,800
saying we are the bad guys

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,840
knowledgefight

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,920
Dan and Jordan, knowledgefight

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,280
I need money

11
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,640
A&E In Kansas, A&E in Kansas, A&E in Stop It

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,960
A&E in Kansas, A&E in Kansas, A&E in It's time to pray

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,200
A&E in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding us

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,600
Hello Alex, I'm a first-time caller, I'm a huge fan

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,800
I love your room

18
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,720
I love you.

19
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,720
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight.

20
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,720
I'm Dan.

21
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,720
I'm Jordan.

22
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,720
We're a couple dudes.

23
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,200
I'd like to sit around and worship at the altar of Selene and talk a little bit about

24
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,200
Alex Jones.

25
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,200
Oh, indeed we are, Dan.

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,200
Jordan.

27
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,200
Dan.

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,200
Jordan.

29
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,200
I have a quick question for you.

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,200
What's up?

31
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,200
What's your bright spot today?

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,400
My bright spot today, this is actually a bright spot I'm excited to give or to discuss.

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,520
All right.

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,840
I was a fan of The Tick growing up.

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,840
Oh, hell yeah.

36
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,840
The animated cartoon?

37
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,840
Cartoon.

38
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,840
I loved it.

40
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,840
Deflator Mouse, come on, man.

41
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,840
Chairface Chippendale.

42
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,840
Of course.

43
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,840
It doesn't get better than that.

44
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

45
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,840
Great.

46
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,840
Loved it.

47
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,840
Fantastic.

48
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,560
The sensibility of it, the humor, everything about it was just fantastic.

49
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,560
I loved it as a kid.

50
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:48,640
I have always been a little bit hesitant to give other interpretations of The Tick a chance.

51
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,480
I tried watching the newer one.

52
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,480
Which one?

53
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,480
The Patrick Warburton one?

54
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,480
No.

55
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,480
The Peter Serafinowicz one.

56
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,480
Gotcha.

57
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,480
Yeah.

58
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,480
Peter Serafinowicz is great, isn't he?

59
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,480
It's outstanding.

60
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,480
It's so good.

61
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,480
Yes.

62
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,480
It's so good.

63
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:08,080
I'm a few episodes in and I'm like, this is exactly what I would have wanted from a live

64
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,960
action version of The Tick.

65
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,960
Totally.

66
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,960
Spectacular.

67
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,960
Yeah.

68
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,680
There's so many little subtle things.

69
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,640
I would never have guessed that Serafinowicz would get the character that good.

70
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,640
You know what I'm saying?

71
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,040
And Griffin Newman's fantastic as Arthur.

72
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,040
Totally.

73
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,040
No, no, he's great.

74
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,760
But at least the first episodes are really hinging around him and this sort of backstory

75
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,760
of him as a superhero.

76
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,760
Totally.

77
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,560
And that's exactly the way to tell the story.

78
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,200
It's really good.

79
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,320
I am so pumped.

80
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,520
I'm bummed that I think it's canceled, right?

81
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,400
I'm pretty sure it's canceled, yeah.

82
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,980
Sucks that there's a limited amount of them, but I'm excited to have something to watch

83
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,120
that I really enjoy.

84
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,400
Yeah, that was one of my favorites.

85
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,180
I'll never forget Deflator Mouse, just because I saw the cartoon when I was eight or something.

86
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,180
So young.

87
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:04,000
And it was like 20 years later that I was like, oh, that's a reference to a fucking

88
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
opera?

89
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Shit!

90
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You know?

91
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,860
What kind of eight year old is going to be like, what a great pun?

92
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,640
Was The Mad Bomber Who Bombs at Midnight a pun?

93
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,020
I do like The Mad Bomber Who Bombs at Midnight.

94
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,120
So what's your bright spot?

95
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,360
My bright spot, Dan, is walking.

96
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,360
Not Christopher.

97
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
Oh.

98
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,360
Ah, no.

99
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,240
The weather's nice out, and we only live a couple miles away from each other, so I've

100
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,800
started walking to do the show.

101
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,200
It's about a 40 minute walk, which is the perfect length of time to start going back

102
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,000
through old albums and actually listen to the full thing.

103
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh, yeah.

104
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,380
Yeah, I've been going through the Ninja Tunes label here recently, and I just got to Lemon

105
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:55,720
Jellies 64 through 95, and the final track on that is called Go, and it is so good because

106
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:02,300
they use William Shatner's sample there, and so it's just like they finally do something

107
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,640
good with William Shatner.

108
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:09,840
It's been so long, but they finally did something good with William Shatner around 20 years

109
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,840
ago.

110
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,180
What about those talk albums that he did?

111
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,180
That's what they're doing.

112
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,640
They're taking samples from the talk albums.

113
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,480
But I think that even just those raw are great.

114
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,480
Oh, you think so?

115
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,480
Really?

116
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,480
No, I don't know.

117
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
I actually haven't listened to them.

118
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,480
I know a lot of people make jokes about it.

119
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,480
Yeah, I mean, it's easy to make jokes about it.

120
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,280
What are you going to say about it?

121
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,280
It's good?

122
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,640
I guess that's as good a joke as I have.

123
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,640
This is good.

124
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,400
Hey, look, we're going to put this on on a date.

125
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,240
We're going to lower the lights a little bit and just listen to some Shatner.

126
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,240
And make out to some Shatner.

127
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,240
Exactly.

128
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,240
Yes.

129
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
What are you doing?

130
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,240
Yeah.

131
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,240
So, Jordan.

132
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,240
Yes, sir.

133
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,240
I'm glad you're enjoying these albums.

134
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,400
And today we have an album to discuss.

135
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,400
Oh, yeah.

136
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,400
And that is an episode of Alex's show.

137
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,400
Okay.

138
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
I look at those as albums.

139
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,400
Okay.

140
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,400
Yeah.

141
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,400
All right.

142
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
He's prolific.

143
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,400
Very.

144
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
Yes.

145
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,400
We're going over May 21st, 2003.

146
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,400
Blackjack.

147
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,400
No.

148
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,400
God damn it.

149
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,400
I bet.

150
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,400
Oh, shit.

151
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,400
We're going back to the past.

152
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Okay.

153
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,680
And part of this is because we had a little bit of sort of a cliffhanger on the last episode.

154
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,480
Alex was complaining a whole bunch about The Matrix.

155
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
Yep.

156
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,480
And he was saying he was going to go see it.

157
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,480
Of course.

158
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,480
And he did not.

159
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,480
And he didn't.

160
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,480
So we have to satisfy this.

161
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,120
We have to give some sort of closure to this.

162
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,120
Yeah.

163
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,120
Of course.

164
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,600
And I will say that Alex has seen The Matrix by this point, and we're going to get one

165
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
of those rare gems.

166
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,080
Solid movie reviews.

167
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,440
We're going to get a gem of a movie review out of Alex.

168
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,440
Okay.

169
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
I'm excited.

170
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,440
Yeah.

171
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,440
As am I. I'm thrilled to walk you through this.

172
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,400
But before we do, we've got to take a moment to say hello to some new wonks out there.

173
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,400
That's a great idea.

174
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,760
So first, Steven T. Thank you so much.

175
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,000
You're now a policy wonk.

176
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm a policy wonk.

177
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Thanks, Steven.

178
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,960
Next, Lego from St. Paul.

179
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,960
Thank you so much.

180
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,960
You're now a policy wonk.

181
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,960
I'm a policy wonk.

182
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,960
Thanks, Lego.

183
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,960
Thank you.

184
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,960

217
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:17,280
was that the answer to the universe and everything uh no it's 42 right yeah isn't it yeah what the

218
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,560
well the 32 first it would just be fun okay if you know I couldn't tell if you were fucking with me

219
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:29,120
no the the question uh that the universe is trying to answer right is what is six times seven

220
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,280
but if anybody got the question and the answer right at the same time the universe would be

221
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,560
destroyed and be replaced by something even weirder okay yeah well anyway happy birthday

222
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:46,960
Matt uh uh Alex has uh some kind wishes for you being born is a condition that leads to death

223
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,360
you can say that life is a disease that ends in death so Jordan um today we're going to be

224
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,760
talking about uh Alex on the on may 21st and I this is a rare instance where I decided like

225
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:06,320
I have not watched these movies in forever it's been a long time and so I decided I might need

226
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:14,400
to refresh my memory and I actually watched the matrix reloaded as a as a sort of refresher course

227
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,000
because I was like what is he talking about even when it comes to movie reviews Dan's gonna look

228
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,200
into it and research things and take down your opinion well I was curious I was curious because

229
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:31,600
I remember enjoying uh the movie enough sure and and look I have a lot of things I'm gonna read

230
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:38,960
some of my my notes uh just sort of raw yeah uh go over some of my thoughts are you doing a live

231
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:45,040
tweeting of uh I basically did uh on a notebook page um I'm gonna go over a little bit but this

232
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:55,040
was uh not bad not a bad not a bad film I enjoyed it I would appreciate more movie reviews that were

233
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,960
just very simple a couple words I'm sick of these long like explanations of the plot and the history

234
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:06,480
of the movie and the shots angle and what that means for interpretation no it's all right it

235
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,080
really picked up after the highway scene yeah that's true I will say that that's true a little

236
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,080
bit of at the beginning was a slog to get through but whatever no everybody wants to watch the

237
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:24,400
dancing scene for at least another six minutes it had some pacing issues um but I don't begrudge

238
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,360
that too much it wasn't it wasn't insurmountable in terms of enjoying the movie no no no um

239
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,640
like I said I have some thoughts so does Alex last night I went and saw the matrix I'm gonna give

240
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:42,160
about a five minute review of that and I think a transcript of my review should be made I want to

241
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:49,600
give a warning about this film if there was any questions about being uh from Illuminati origin

242
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:57,840
those are now answered put those concerns to bed is it yes oh yeah okay it is a deeply Illuminati

243
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,560
shit just for the listeners I need you to know that when Alex said I'm gonna give you about a

244
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,080
five minute review Dan just went shook his head no it is not gonna be a five minute review nor

245
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:17,120
should it be transcribed all of that was wrong um yeah so apparently uh Alex had seen the first

246
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:23,520
Matrix movie sure and he was like is this Illuminati shit I don't know and he saw the second

247
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:30,560
one he's like yes definitely Illuminati shit I do like that the concerns have been put to bed put

248
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,720
them to bed put the concerns to bed yeah because the answer is yes which is somehow less concerning

249
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,520
well I mean it's it's no longer an open question now you know that this is just evil I mean I

250
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:47,520
suppose certainty is a comfort in some ways right yeah so I guess at this point I would say that um

251
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:53,120
if you're convinced that this uh movie has Illuminati origins maybe you shouldn't do that

252
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,000
whole red pill thing like maybe you shouldn't take that metaphor because the Illuminati made

253
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,520
that metaphor so so what you're saying is perhaps these stupid thoughts uh are bullshit that they're

254
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,280
feeling in the moment and then later on they'll be like that's actually a great movie and let's

255
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:13,280
use the metaphor yes yeah that sounds I get the sense of that yeah that sounds about right um so

256
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:19,360
there's a lot of people who shouldn't see this movie humans yes but if you're gonna see it you

257
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:26,160
whatever just don't show it to kids I would not let my children watch the film and uh if you want

258
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:35,600
to see it yourself to see the face of the new world order go ahead but uh it uh very very dark

259
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:42,400
and very evil uh is all I can really say about Matrix Reloaded but uh I'm gonna

260
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:50,320
go over some of it here on the show he does he does go over a little bit of it yeah I will say

261
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:56,640
that from I listened to Alex's review first got confused and then I watched the movie I'm like

262
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,160
boy there's a lot he doesn't cover

263
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,960
he would not have a very good sense of the movie it's a big movie it's a big movie yeah there might

264
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:13,840
be too much in it but um you know he he starts off his conversation about uh the Matrix by talking

265
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:20,800
about the first movie and I don't know if I agree with his premise okay the first Matrix was

266
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:34,160
obviously new age in its overall presentation that you've got to believe in yourself and then you can

267
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:40,480
change the parameters that is not no reality no problem within I take issue with that I mean like

268
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,360
maybe there is some new ageiness to it certainly sure sure but I don't think that it's about like

269
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,640
believe in yourself and you can change the parameters of reality I am fairly certain

270
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:55,520
that most everybody in that movie who also believed in themselves right next to Neo

271
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:01,440
was immediately murdered within the first 45 minutes yeah Neo didn't have the ability to

272
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,600
change things because he believed in himself he had the ability to change things because he was

273
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:12,000
created and born inside the Matrix yeah I understand maybe that you're trying to say

274
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,960
that we're all the chosen one but that's not what the movie is trying to say yes yes if you're going

275
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:22,880
to bring that to the film that's on you yeah I mean and for fuck's sakes in one movie later

276
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:28,960
after this one Neo is literally in a Christ-like position to show you that he's making the

277
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:35,920
sacrifice spoilers I'm sorry apologies I have to get to that a couple years from now it's Alex

278
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:42,480
freaks out about that now you got to go hunting for when Revolutions was released oh god I can't

279
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,880
wait um yeah I think his interpretation of the first movie is a little bit flawed yeah

280
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,320
based on everything about the first movie yes the and the watching of it but he you know he

281
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:01,440
watched this this the first film and like I said he was confused he's like is this illuminati how

282
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,360
do you get confused well because you don't know if it's illuminati or not maybe the Wachowskis

283
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:13,920
are putting out something that is heroic sure anti-illuminati sure or maybe it's illuminati

284
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:22,320
and so I was ambiguous I'm certainly a Christian and didn't follow the new age Hindu or Buddhist

285
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:32,800
line but I was still overall not sure if the film was a production of the globalist

286
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:41,840
what well now I am sure that the matrix one and the matrix two matrix reloaded are

287
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:51,120
in the most pure sense illuminati productions so I was pretty excited to hear about like

288
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,840
why yeah in the most pure sense what sealed the deal what was it about this film that was like

289
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,400
yeah no dead to rights this is this is globalist I need to know I mean did you just watch the

290
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:08,240
credits and the executive producers were the illuminati sorrow exactly like is that what

291
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:17,680
we're dealing with I was not prepared for how this review would get going okay I I was like okay

292
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:23,040
he's gonna misinterpret something sure you know I couldn't have possibly imagined that this was

293
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:29,760
the start of it look down for this okay it's outrageous the film begins obviously with a

294
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:39,120
group of trailers and there is a wide screen shot that has been squeezed down and distorted

295
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:51,600
as an authority figure type man in black sits behind a table with flickering subliminals being

296
00:15:51,600 --> 00:16:00,640
splashed on the screen talking about power aid alex is mad about a power aid commercial I am no

297
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:09,600
I am no uh you know what it I was I was I was out when he said before we even get to the movie

298
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,800
we got to deal with the trailers yeah no no no no no I don't even why would the illuminati count

299
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,080
trailers this isn't even a trailer this is a commercial power raid yes I thought he was

300
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:25,200
misinterpreting a fucking uh commercial for men in black 2 or something like rip torn is sitting

301
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:30,240
behind a desk it's not it's not we'll get into it but he's really mad about okay okay it's a power

302
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,240
talks down to you and says you're not even going to understand what I'm saying to you

303
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:44,720
you pathetic mindless hive mind of units you are units that power the matrix drink your power aid

304
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,480
do as you are ordered to do

305
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,320
so that's how the film begins it's not it's a commercial

306
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:00,720
um it's not how the film begins it's really not how the film begins if you watch it like now if

307
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,640
you were to stream it it doesn't start the power a commercial isn't there no so this wasn't an

308
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,600
authority figure in the commercial it was one of the agents from the movie there weren't subliminal

309
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,520
flickering lights the commercial was just set in the entire great interrogation room where they

310
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,320
took neo in the first movie sure some of the stuff that alex is saying is from the commercial but

311
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:26,160
some is also his own embellishment but it's obviously just a way to like sell power aid

312
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,720
using a character from the movie yeah i spent a lot of time thinking about it and honestly this

313
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:36,240
is the only way you could do a commercial like this with a tie-in to the matrix like if you use

314
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:42,400
any of the main characters it's gonna really seem goofy as shit oh no no the agent would be great

315
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,440
they're perfect for this because they don't have a personality except for agent smith so they're

316
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,520
essentially just blank slates yeah one of them selling power aid doesn't negatively affect your

317
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:58,000
impression of the agents because it can't they aren't individuals right so it's fine that said

318
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,160
i went and watched this commercial uh and there is a canon problem with the commercial okay

319
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,920
i'm gonna play a little clip here uh from that commercial and then we'll discuss uh the issue

320
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:15,440
i love this show consider this the active human body can generate up to 12 000 btus of body heat

321
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:24,160
pure precious life-giving energy it is unfortunate your collective puny little minds couldn't figure

322
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:31,840
out a way to harness this energy put it to good use somehow but that's beside the point the point

323
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:40,720
is to keep generating all that energy your body needs to be replenished so drink your power aid

324
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,760
we have quotas to meet so that's obviously supposed to be like deadpan comedy yeah yeah

325
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,560
the problem is that this agent is trying to sell power aid to people who are inside the matrix

326
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,320
activities inside the matrix shouldn't affect the amount of energy that gets produced by the

327
00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:00,160
person's physical body outside of the matrix people's actual bodies are in pods they have

328
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,880
no need for power aid there's tubes and stuff going into them i do believe that they are

329
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,200
suspended in goo of some sort you wouldn't even be able to get that power to their mouths power

330
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,240
is it power aid that they're suspended it might be that could be true if so this commercial is

331
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,840
underselling if you don't have power aid you will die yeah given what we know about the machines in

332
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,960
the movies if physical activity in the matrix translated to greater energy production in the

333
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:31,120
real world then everyone in the matrix would be suspiciously into exercise and fitness if you have

334
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,840
like seven billion batteries and you could boost their productivity by 30 if their avatar of the

335
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:41,200
matrix works out that's an amount of energy production that would not be ignored by machines

336
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,760
no no no generally they are well known for efficiency they keep humans in pods

337
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,800
anything is on the table that's what i'm saying i do like the idea that there's somebody somewhere

338
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:59,920
like man nobody is using these gym memberships nobody this is unreal this is unreal anyway

339
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:05,520
the bottom line here is that uh this commercial is just kind of dumb it's kind of just a fun

340
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,440
powerade commercial that played before the movie it's not part of the film and it's not meant to

341
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:17,040
shame people for being dumb like there's an ai version of irkot it's like sorry guys nobody's

342
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:23,200
working out so you can't turn your ac on this this week like come on man yeah i like i like though

343
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,080
that alex is sitting there in the theater watching this powerade commercial and he's like i am

344
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:36,400
personally insulted by this character talking down to me all you need i i have been shamed by this

345
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:46,000
powerade commercial wow you just can't find a single moment not to be mad about yeah if you

346
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,800
can get mad about a powerade commercial what why even bother with the movie you're already done

347
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:58,480
yeah what's it like what's it like what's it like how do you take in any media if you're

348
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:07,760
shamed by a power so the actual movie starts sure and uh here's where alex is at then it launches

349
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:20,880
into uh the world of the matrix that is the real physical world of the underground base of xion

350
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:34,480
yes xion get it and you have the marauding forces that that uh surface to the wrecked cities above

351
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:46,240
and transmit the minds or the souls in a type of digital astral projection okay into the machine

352
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:55,200
world or the matrix and you're told that both of these are reality because perception is reality

353
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,280
if there's one thing that i took away from the message of the matrix movies even before i went

354
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,600
and re-watched it it's kind of the opposite of perception is reality yeah basically what you

355
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,480
perceive is not real yes that's the point it felt like the point of the movie is that some things

356
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,800
that feel like reality might not be but there is a definite reality which is worth fighting for

357
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:19,280
yeah if perception was truly reality then it wouldn't matter if neo ever perceived the matrix

358
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,920
to be the actual world or an illusion if he accepted the matrix as reality then it would

359
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:30,080
actually be that the movies do actually deal with this quite eloquently perception can shape reality

360
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,960
to an extent like if you're in the matrix and you want that to be a reality it's possible to

361
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,320
live your entire life in that state and not run into any problems joey pants his character in the

362
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,720
first movie he wants to be reinserted into the matrix and not be aware of the fight against the

363
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,040
robots because it's more comfortable to him and it's implied that that's something that can be

364
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:56,240
done his subjective experience and perception can create his subjective reality but that isn't real

365
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,640
the movie is very clear that there's an entirely different actual reality that exists regardless

366
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,480
of your subjective beliefs about reality nothing you do in the matrix affects that fact as the what

367
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:13,040
is reality robots have turned humans into batteries and shit in the first movie the first

368
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:20,080
thing he does is show you the desert of the real the real not not the desert of the we perceive

369
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,360
this to be dark it's really interesting to me that this is this is where alex is at because

370
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,840
he's getting caught up in a pretty elementary philosophical question about perception and

371
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:35,760
reality that the wachowski's movie actually goes one step beyond in terms of like even just the

372
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,720
starting point is past this i think that's what we're really dealing with here it's like when

373
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,760
you're when you're watching he sounds like he's explaining the movie to my grandma you know of

374
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,640
just like things that aren't really part of the movie but she's gonna like it a lot more than if

375
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,920
you tell her like there's a car chase you know like that's not what's gonna work for her yep

376
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:04,000
so trinity jumps on a motorcycle yeah right okay wearing black spandex it looks great um so zion

377
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,760
he takes issue with uh-huh he takes issue with like weird things uh specifically about like

378
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,520
naming conventions yeah but when i went back and i watched it i was like it's interesting that he

379
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:19,120
doesn't take issue with everything yeah everything has a fucking name that means something it's kind

380
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,000
of a reference to everything yeah and so the zion stuck out in his head and then here's another one

381
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:36,000
and the whole film is basically illuminati characters dark masonic overtones with a dark

382
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,240
occult leader and he says that we are the occult we're the vampires we're the werewolves we're the

383
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:49,200
demons nope absolutely not him that and of course he's called the merovingian or the merovingian

384
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,960
bloodline this is what the satanist based in france believe that they are descendants of jesus

385
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,320
and he's brothers with satan this is deep occult illuminati stuff so alex takes issue with the

386
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:07,680
merovingian he's not a good guy nope okay we're we all recognize that he's bad yeah that's why

387
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:13,360
he's got that name yeah and he's not even like high-end villain he's he's an antagonist he's a

388
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,480
middle manager yeah yeah yeah he is the mini boss of this side quest totally they have to go get

389
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:25,760
the key maker yes yeah yeah yeah um yeah i guess it's you know zion and merovingian you can take

390
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,200
some issue with those but what about like Nebuchadnezzar was the name of their ship

391
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,560
yeah yeah yeah what about trinity no don't worry about it no don't worry about it no

392
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:42,240
morpheus absolutely no reference there dan it's it's interesting the selective uh sort of outrage

393
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,800
or selective like pointing this out as sure something that means something without without

394
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:52,960
incorporating all of the things right into it like it just it's pick and choose yeah i mean

395
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:00,000
if you name something zion in a piece of popular culture someone's gonna be pissed and it's usually

396
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,560
and it's usually gonna be hard right christians it's gonna be alex in 2003 exactly yes that's

397
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:09,360
going to happen but if you're mad about that you can't you can't let that get in the way of being

398
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,000
mad about all the other religious references in the movie you know that's the problem here he

399
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,800
needs to be a more holistic hater yeah so the movie it's evil that's that's i mean really the

400
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,440
bottom line and again i'm showing you about small tidbits of this i've got to go back and take notes

401
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:33,680
which i will do this is a i've never seen a more powerful overtly soul twisting mind control film

402
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,680
there is lesbian and homosexual scenes in the film oh my god oh my god the fucking

403
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,160
illuminati are back at it dan why is that the first thing that he brings up after saying that

404
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:54,240
it's mind twisting and evil because i urges it's very weird to me it's very strange even for alex

405
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:02,160
that's weird yeah there's homosexual and lesbian scenes yeah yeah 2003 was uh was different though

406
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:09,760
like uh you know that was before gay people were even allowed to marry it's true so uh i i think

407
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:16,560
there was a lot more open and vicious uh uh well i mean now there's so much open and vicious hatred

408
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:25,040
man the world sucks bummer yep um so look this is all just trying to make implants fashionable

409
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:30,560
right body mods yeah yeah jacks in the back of your head yeah and living in the future now

410
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,400
that's been born out oh yeah we all have jacks we all have jacks in the back of our head yeah

411
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:43,680
uh there also is everyone has chip implants and chip plug-ins and this is a good thing

412
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:48,800
good thing we have a little speech in there where the machines aren't bad we can fight them with all

413
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:55,280
of all of this so it's making it a new fashion statement probably one of the strongest cultural

414
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:03,280
movements we've seen in history in modern history is the matrix the video games and the cartoons now

415
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:14,800
in the a bunch of spin-off uh cartoons for the big screen and dvd there was they again are

416
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:20,880
conditioning the children the anime that it's normal to have plug-ins into your mind wire heads

417
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:27,760
as they were called decades ago it is fashionable to have implant points all over your body like

418
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:33,360
okay so matrix was popular right yeah and alex is trying to make this argument that like they're

419
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,920
trying to condition you to get jacks on the back of your head to plug into computers or something

420
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:43,920
sure but like if your argument is just that it's popular and there's like spin-off properties like

421
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:50,800
what about the ninja turtles oh yeah like they were huge yeah yeah what about that were they

422
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:55,600
try what were what were the globalists trying to mainline uh then were they trying to turn us all

423
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:02,320
into people who go into goo well i know i know that i had and this i remember specifically i had

424
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:08,560
a rafael action figure and what you would do is you would push rafael's head down and it would

425
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:13,760
attach to a spring and then you'd uh click it and the head would pop out like he was headbutting you

426
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:19,040
right and from that i learned that the illuminati want me to headbutt the shit out of people wait

427
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:26,160
wait a second yeah i know rafael was a ninja turtle true what weapon does neo grab when he's

428
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:31,920
fighting the mira vingian's goons in that staircase was it was it size he does he does

429
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:39,360
yes no shit oh wow neo is rafael this is blowing the whole thing wide open for me oh man perception

430
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:44,880
is reality wait wait ninja turtles were preparing us for the matrix right preparing us to take

431
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,360
the jacks in the back of our head right i mean wasn't it a point of pride in the movie though

432
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:55,840
how many people were born naturally who didn't have the jacks and were like happy about it i'm

433
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:01,040
pretty sure that that was a i believe so yeah yeah um also the scene that alex is talking about like

434
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:06,320
with uh the machines are good or whatever is it's just that scene where the dude takes neo down to

435
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:14,000
the engineering level yeah in uh in zion yeah and he's like well you know machines suck but also

436
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,280
we gotta use them yeah we wouldn't be able to breathe down here yeah yeah so it's like a win

437
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:25,040
some lose some situation it was a little heavy-handed in terms of the uh the dialogue but

438
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,360
you know whatever i guess if alex wants to take that as oh that's right whenever the old guy pulls

439
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,480
him aside and they're standing on the ledge with all the apartments behind him and no one can see

440
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,600
them or whatever yeah yeah it's in the middle of the night the thing i loved about that scene is

441
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:48,160
like this fucking apartment complex if you want to call it that is gigantic huge that dude the

442
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:53,680
counselor or whatever had to have been waiting forever on the off chance that neo would walk

443
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:58,080
out of his little apartment so he could walk up and be like do you need some coke hey you want

444
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:03,120
to hang out i would have loved for the like a scene of the movie just be like dude he doesn't

445
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,840
even have like a cell phone to like play a game on or something he's just sitting there twiddling

446
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:14,160
his thumbs he's got he's got the neo futuristic version of angry birds and he's just throwing

447
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:21,280
plushies off the off the edge shit i hope neo has a bad dream and wakes up he comes out here

448
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,600
just gonna wait gotta make this look like i'm randomly passing by

449
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:35,360
he's hiding around the corner yeah yeah oh when he opens the door yeah so um you know the big set

450
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:41,680
piece uh at the end of the movie is uh neo meets with the architect sure who created all the

451
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:49,280
previous matrix right right and explains to neo that he is a uh like a uh aberration yeah yeah

452
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:54,400
matrix yeah uh he's supposed to go to the source and then everything will reboot reset all over

453
00:31:54,400 --> 00:32:00,000
again it was built into the code etc etc yeah so alex talks about that a little bit and the

454
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:09,120
architect this old man sigmund freud obi-wan kenobi archetype no to both sits there and uh

455
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:17,120
tells neo that they have allowed people to leave the matrix that they discovered

456
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:21,440
that suppressing an exodus from the matrix

457
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:35,200
actually causes a shutdown and a degradation of the 99 that remain inside their exoluthal tanks

458
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:44,000
that's correct as human batteries for the power grid surprised he understood and again you find

459
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:54,000
out that basically the computers are disembodied spirits are angels are devils and uh have all the

460
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:05,280
same carnal desires as humans but with an added uh viciousness like greek god so it is an illuminati

461
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:13,360
film through and they tell you we are the proof god okay i that clip was fascinating to me because

462
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:18,560
he's kind of getting it but he also doesn't seem to understand that it's a piece of fiction no

463
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:24,160
and then second he doesn't get that the characters in the matrix that like neo runs into are supposed

464
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:31,920
to be programmed yeah he doesn't get like the idea that these are their programs in a computer no

465
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:38,240
no they explicitly say things that are like oh that's what you are yeah you know like uh the

466
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:44,640
guy who fights neo before he goes to talk to the uh the oracle is like he he's basically like a

467
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,280
password screen yeah yeah whatever to authenticate totally whenever they go through all those doors

468
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:54,560
like it's the back door in a program like they talk about this pretty explicitly almost constantly

469
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:59,760
yes to the point where you're like wait and is when is he gonna fight microsoft word yeah they

470
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,800
aren't greek gods yeah or anything yeah he's gonna like clippy yeah exactly what is this gonna show

471
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:10,080
up agent smith absorbs clippy you're trying to destroy the make matrix would you like some help

472
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:16,560
with that oh god yeah i don't understand i don't understand how you can like get half of it i guess

473
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:24,960
and not the the the bigger picture yeah the oracle herself itself is a program and not a person or

474
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:33,360
an actual oracle at delphi yes yeah so i have now uh my notes from the matrix reloaded they're

475
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:38,240
getting intense you remember i do appreciate that your handwriting is much larger than mine

476
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,720
um that was just sort of like so i could scribble you know like i see so i could watch it and also

477
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:48,240
like half ha ha haphazardly take notes gotcha so here i'm just gonna read the notes uh-huh

478
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:54,480
as they appear on the page michael from lost exclamation point true i forgot that michael

479
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,720
from lost was in this he's one of the main characters he is one of the main characters yes

480
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,280
he's like one of the four people of in abaca and he's great yeah he's really great i love that guy

481
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:09,360
he's really good in the role too yep i don't want him to get hurt yeah um what oh this is just a

482
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:14,240
little note one of the fun things about the matrix is how important non-neo characters are that's

483
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:19,360
true you know what is it is like he's the chosen one and all this but none of it would be possible

484
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:24,880
like what he's doing if it weren't for other things that like morpheus is doing or niobe is

485
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:31,840
doing like everyone else has like parts that they need to play in order for him to be able to live

486
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:37,280
up to his oneness totally or whatever i think that's great it is absolutely no coincidence

487
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,600
either that all of those characters are from a diverse set of backgrounds with a bunch of

488
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:48,400
different possibilities within that yeah yeah yeah my next note roy jones jr i forgot that

489
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:54,320
roy jones jr is in this i also forgot that roy jones jr was in that i almost forgot oh man yeah

490
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,440
one of the one of the great albums one of the great uh rap albums uh round one the album uh

491
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:05,200
roy jones jr weird who want to get knocked out who want to fight roy jones who want to be next

492
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:12,320
now that i think about it that is weird oh yes oh boy yeah weird yep okay uh there's that scene

493
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:17,280
where there's two oh this is just a stupid note so there's a scene where there's like agent smith

494
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,440
turns another person into an agent smith yeah each other yeah they made the staring thing i

495
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,800
just wrote two agent smith should kiss totally they had to have at some point right it felt

496
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:34,560
like they were going they had to have um all right um what would you do if you met you dad

497
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,880
i probably think you'd fall in love i don't think so i'd probably try and beat myself

498
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,960
so i i thought that it was a little bit tacky that the beef between morpheus and the commander

499
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,160
was about niobe was about a woman like i thought that was a little bit uh easy uh yeah especially

500
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,240
when we're dealing with on the other hand there's part of me that thinks it's a good character

501
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,680
choice because despite the fact that we're dealing with such an end of the world level threat of

502
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:04,720
course people are still going to have those dumb little uh personal beefs you know what i'm saying

503
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:10,480
i get that it's a little bit convenient and a little simple exactly i fucking love harry lenox

504
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:17,360
dude who plays the commander he is great he is really really good he is oh what a fucking hard

505
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:24,640
ass for no reason half the time but also this is my next note he's not wrong to doubt morpheus no

506
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:29,840
no no agree totally rational morpheus is out of pocket he's doing all kinds of shit he's

507
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:36,000
ignoring the chain of command yes fully understand yeah um the other the other thing too that i was

508
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,600
thinking about is like you know you you you forget i guess if you haven't seen these movies in a

509
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:48,640
while you kind of forget that everybody hates neo and and morpheus basically they're not the heroes

510
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:56,800
to the powers that be in the the human world right of zion like they are not like they are out like

511
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,840
you said they're out of pocket yeah totally and you forget that it's they're they're they're

512
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:08,240
basically populist leaders alex should love this yeah to a certain to a certain uh interpretation

513
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:14,800
too you can view that as like it is a positive thing that these people will just completely

514
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:20,640
ignore orders and completely ignore the the uh current power structure in order to fight what

515
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:26,160
they believe is is true and correct but also what if they were wrong they've just killed all of

516
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:34,320
humanity so there's that yeah you know uh next note i love a cave but zion sucks um i do love

517
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:41,360
a cave uh i just didn't care for the aesthetic of of zion i will tell you about the cave we when i

518
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:46,320
i watched that movie with uh my best friend and his dad because uh i can't remember how

519
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:52,880
old we were at the time but it wasn't like cool for us to go because my parents heard

520
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:58,640
that there was a tit in the dance scene in the cave oh no oh there was a tit my friend really

521
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:05,040
oh no joke oh could you have spotted it unless somebody told you way in advance there's a lot

522
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,920
of people there's tons of people but that was enough for my family to be like hey there might

523
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,960
be a tit and not being able to see that leads me to my next note and that is this cave is way too

524
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:22,640
big that was a giant cave everyone's having their their uh their moment the tribal beats and the

525
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:29,200
rave it's too big the acoustics were great in that cave it's too big it's ridiculously big

526
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:37,840
uh next note uh fishburn not good i don't think he was carrying his weight i think the first movie

527
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:43,200
he did so much yeah that in this one he was allowed to just kind of be in the background

528
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:50,000
yeah you know i was just not uh that i was not that into him um so next note is neo a virgin

529
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,480
look when he and trinity are hooking up sure is that his first time i mean in the real world it

530
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,760
has to be doesn't it i would think so yeah that's interesting what not very but a little bit

531
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,880
interesting what what kind of what kind of dick prowess could you have if you've only done it in

532
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:10,880
the imaginary world i don't know i mean maybe hey if you come in in the matrix you come in real life

533
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:16,640
is that true i think so if you die in the matrix then yeah so everybody's goo is gross as shit

534
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:22,720
next note keanu is not enough of a blank slate like when he was sitting there talking to the

535
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:29,520
the oracle yeah i was like he's supposed to be like a blank slate that's kind of you know you

536
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:35,920
have sure he's he has too much agency for the role that he's in i think okay all right i might

537
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:41,360
be wrong but yeah i think we could i i would need to watch the movie again and then we could really

538
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:47,360
get into it i got a little bit bored uh there's because it drives a little bit yeah and i i

539
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:53,360
this note is this movie is just a video game everything is a fetch quest yeah that's a good

540
00:40:53,360 --> 00:41:00,560
point constantly over and over again yeah yeah oh you have to go get the key maker oh the key maker

541
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:06,160
takes you to a door like you know over and over again like you have to go to a oh and then once

542
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:11,760
you get there oh no you gotta go to b oh no you gotta go to c it's it's a little bit clunky but

543
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:18,160
like i said like once they get to the the like highway chase scene things pick up business

544
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:23,520
business picks up yeah yeah you forget a little bit of like they're just going around doing a

545
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,280
quest right all right you get lost you get absorbed in it a little bit more but at the

546
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:33,920
beginning it's it was a drag oh uh later on it's borderline a heist film in that way of

547
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:40,240
like a problem arises we have to go somewhere and get the you know like uh like oceans 11 we got to

548
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:46,560
go get the uh emp from some other place because ours broke or whatever yeah yeah like that kind

549
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:54,560
of thing next note hugo weaving is a monster he's killing it he hmm he's good he is good he's good

550
00:41:54,560 --> 00:42:00,160
at acting he's good at uh agent smith i don't know about my uh my boys elrond i have a different

551
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,240
interpretation of the elrond but that's fine that's fine i'm talking about just in this film

552
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:12,160
he is crushing i get it i get it also i didn't really have as much of a memory of who the bad

553
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:19,280
guy is like obviously in the first movie the bad guy is the matrix it's the mature sure and i kind

554
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,520
of thought that was true in the second movie too and then agent smith becomes the villain in the

555
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:30,480
third one i didn't realize that it was really clear early in the second movie and it's agent

556
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:36,720
oh yeah yeah yeah the matrix and the machines are no longer really like they're an impediment maybe

557
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:44,640
yeah they're a hassle but the bad guy is clearly agent smith yeah it's a virus yeah yeah um also

558
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:50,400
this is this is just a little bit of a nitpick thing uh neo stops bullets yes you know yeah

559
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:58,080
why is he ever punched sometimes you get punched he has telekinesis i don't understand why nobody

560
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:03,600
threw a bottle of power raid at him that he can also stop with his matrix powers yeah that seems

561
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:07,600
to make the most sense to me and then while he's stopping the power raid he could scold alex

562
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:14,560
this will give you power uh i thought the cga fight scenes looked amazing for being made in

563
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:20,480
2003 totally they hold up they look like sometimes like a little bit of it's a little bit cartoony

564
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,880
you can tell it's digital but like considering that this is 18 years old or yeah yeah it's

565
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:31,280
amazing there was a point in the agent smith fight where you so clearly see it go from people trying

566
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:40,000
to actually do a choreography to uh like complete cgi stuff where you're like okay well this might

567
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,640
be uh a little bit on the uncanny valley but but it's not like it wasn't so much that that it took

568
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:51,120
me out of the experience of watching the fight scene totally no like you get like oh yeah that's

569
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:56,080
that's digital or whatever but it's not distracting and it's a cool fight scene yeah uh next note

570
00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:08,080
everyone is right all of the humans are right morality is complicated everyone disagrees with

571
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,280
it everyone disagrees and everyone is right

572
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:21,120
i thought that was a little bit weird i do i like that i like that a lot i like that everybody's

573
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:26,880
right but everybody is also disagreeing about yeah yeah it's complicated maybe they have across

574
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:32,960
purposes kind of you know like maybe it's like you have the same goal and the way that you think

575
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:39,440
we're going to get to that goal is correct right uh but it might be sort of contradictory next note

576
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,560
two exclamation points on this one no you haven't used two exclamation points for three years

577
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:49,040
correction three oh shit this is unprecedented cornell west

578
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,000
wait cornell west is in there i forgot that he plays one of the members of the tribunal

579
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:02,000
he does not it's cornell west yes get the fuck out of here i was like that can't be cornell west

580
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,000
it is it's cornell i will be that i feel like i should have remembered yes although probably the

581
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,520
first time i saw it i had no idea who cornell west was why would i know why would i be a 12 year old

582
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:18,560
that's like a huge cornell west guy yeah it's it's possible that you just had no idea but it's it's

583
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:24,320
outrageous he's one of the people who's on the board or whatever yeah whenever uh they're talking

584
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:29,600
about sending two more captains yeah help out with an old guy the old the old guy who talks

585
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:34,720
yeah and then there's the old lady and then it's cornell west there's a couple other people but

586
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:39,360
yeah those are the three that have speaking roles bananas yep so this is from the mira

587
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:45,120
vingian scene okay i forgot that that woman orgasmed from eating the cake that he sent her

588
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:53,120
that's true that was tacky that was really weird uh because because the only thing that

589
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:58,960
you can think of while that's going on is somebody right next to her going i'll have what she's

590
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:04,320
having like that's literally what's happening yeah and the way that the matrix code goes in

591
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:09,440
between her legs and then there's an explosion i was like this i would i would have taken another

592
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:16,400
pass at this this is this is totally not in line with the rest of this movie also does the code

593
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:25,440
in your genitals give you an orgasm it's an explosion right okay all right um so uh

594
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:32,400
uh the mira vingian's wife monica belucci uh i just thought this was really funny this computer

595
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,000
program really wants to get kissed

596
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:42,400
i don't know why it does seem like that mm-hmm i i i was watching them go in and out of doors

597
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,120
and it made me think of the adjustment bureau okay i have nothing else to add to that i just

598
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:51,520
thought of the adjustment bureau all right they wear the hats they do wear the hats i recall um

599
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:58,320
i i liked the twins i liked the twins the dreadlocked albino twins this is aggressive

600
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:02,720
i don't know why you're pointing at me because i remember not liking them the first time i saw the

601
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:07,120
movie oh okay okay i remember thinking it was a little bit uh dumb or whatever but like their

602
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:13,200
powers are really well defined and well done in the movie yeah they can choose when to have

603
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:20,000
physical form essentially so they can be in danger from a knife or a gun or whatever like the way

604
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,920
they go in and out of cars yeah yeah it's very fun it's a well imaginative yeah yeah um and that

605
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,400
the only thing i didn't like is that like they apparently die in an explosion they could have

606
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:38,080
just gone on corporeal at any time yeah um also neo should just have told uh trinity that

607
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:44,560
he saw her death in the matrix would have really cut down on time it certainly would have been more

608
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:49,120
i don't know because they have a they have what's presented as a good relationship yes they seem to

609
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:53,440
really care about each other correct and it does not make sense that he wouldn't trust her with

610
00:47:53,440 --> 00:48:01,040
that kind of information they're in a post uh like apocalyptic hellscape world let's be on the level

611
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:07,840
with each other yeah yeah yeah honesty is the best policy whenever uh everything is collapsed

612
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:16,480
three exclamation points again okay steaks so the movie has clear steaks oh okay okay everything is

613
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:21,760
very clearly like immediately flashback to the joey pants situation oh no no that was the first

614
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:27,200
movie like wait are there more steak eating scenes no i i i think that the steaks were a lot clearer

615
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:33,680
than i expected them to be yes yeah it made a lot of sense and then uh the last thing that i i uh

616
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:40,640
last note was from the architect scene um you know so he says that you can go to the source

617
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:46,400
and then you choose people to repopulate zion like we've done the last five times sure who was the

618
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:54,960
last one who did that and created this zion right who was that was that i don't know i know oh oh

619
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:00,080
okay you're you're telling me i mean was it the exact same neo was it it can't be the same neo

620
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:04,560
because later on we find out he made a different choice or is it the same neo who's learned from

621
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:12,960
his previous choices i don't know but it's a turncoat it's it's whoever the last uh one was

622
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:21,200
is not a good uh character yeah i mean that's that is that kind of like really dangerous choice

623
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:27,840
of theoretically he could just wind up wiping out the human race and he could just wipe out the

624
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:33,040
he could just wind up wiping out the human race entirely if that neo and i don't know why we're

625
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:41,040
using a gender pronoun for this uh could be anybody but uh you know he's the the person

626
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:46,720
is faced with the choice of like is everybody going to die or am i going to reboot this perhaps

627
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:52,240
infinitely but if i reboot it at least we got another go right you know so there's that there's

628
00:49:52,240 --> 00:50:01,040
that uh moral quandary there um i hated the architect because uh too freudian no to obi-wan

629
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:11,760
no i mean you can't replace uh big words for uh actually making sense you know so there's a lot

630
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:16,880
of that where i'm like you're just using that word because you know people aren't gonna look

631
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:23,680
up the definition later i feel like it made enough sense yeah to like it's it's serviceable

632
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:29,440
no contextually you get it but from a fine granular kind of if i'm combing through the

633
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:34,240
script i'm crossing out five dollar words left and right yeah yeah that might be a good note

634
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:38,880
but also i did enjoy how like you know the obviously the movie is building towards like a

635
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:43,840
climax of like something you think is gonna maybe be like action oriented yeah yeah and then neo

636
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:48,080
walks through the door and it's just an old dude sitting there that is fun yeah it is fun there's

637
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:54,160
some there's some subversion of tropes there yeah yeah um anyway my review overall not bad okay

638
00:50:54,160 --> 00:51:00,000
all right you know i don't like movies that much but i enjoyed at least half of it like i think

639
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:07,120
it was really slow starting yeah like when they're in zion and all that it's it was tough to get

640
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:12,000
through yeah i was like i'm gonna turn this off like 15 minutes in i was like i can't sit here

641
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,360
and watch this but i pushed through and i enjoyed once it got cooking yeah i recall there being a

642
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:26,160
lot of vitriol towards reloaded and uh and then even more towards uh revolution yeah uh but i

643
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:31,200
think that also might be because we were coming off the back of uh uh the phantom menace and

644
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:35,840
attack of the clones at the same time so everybody's just furious at every movie and i

645
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:41,840
think that the first matrix is almost an impossible challenge to follow up totally like i think that

646
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:48,800
that was that was something that caught on so huge yeah and and blew minds like i i don't even

647
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:54,400
know what you would do if you like we were trying to make another one yeah i think they did a fine

648
00:51:54,400 --> 00:52:00,880
job yeah especially with a massive budget that you're expected to show in the film you know like

649
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:08,480
the original matrix was so well uh written and so tight because of those uh you know budget

650
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:14,560
challenges at least partially not of course because of them yeah but that that kind of uh

651
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:21,040
we got to figure out a way to do this that's cheap is a lot of times a really interesting uh and uh

652
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:26,080
uh font of creativity necessity is the mother of invention there we go i would i could have said it

653
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:32,400
like other people do uh-huh well i am the architect um so alex gets uh to talking about the

654
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:37,920
uh how like in 25 years we're all gonna be plugged in that's true we're gonna be plugged

655
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:43,200
into machines man oh we're counting down it's not just wired magazine silicon weekly and many other

656
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:53,360
publications including salon today that are warning you of the takeover last year a new army

657
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:59,280
war college report in 2000 came out and said within 25 years we will all be in a hive mind

658
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:11,200
that the pentagon will oversee the insertion of the public into a control grid that we will all

659
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:20,240
be mounted in our homes wired in to a global government mind control computer see that's

660
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:25,760
kind of fun because alex could take that clip and he could be like look at facebook sure sure you

661
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:30,240
know like he's like i was right yeah yeah he's not no he's talking about the matrix and talking

662
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:35,440
about that being real yeah and there's something uh in your in your house that you're plugged into

663
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:41,280
or whatever like it's not it's not a metaphorical um oh my god social media is gonna take off no

664
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:47,040
and there were people already at the time going like social media might not be a good idea to have

665
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:52,480
it take off and they were people who had studied real life technology and real life trends towards

666
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:58,240
that they weren't like it's gonna be exactly like the matrix dog eyes come on dub dubs the movie's

667
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:04,160
evil yeah come on that's reality all this is though like this whole movie everything is just

668
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:12,480
preparing you jordan sure to go into the matrix okay they are preparing you for your journey into

669
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:18,400
the real matrix now if you're shocked by this i have been warning you long before the matrix came

670
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:24,720
out this was their plan the elite of course will not be implanted and most of you are going to be

671
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:30,560
killed after they release mass plagues this is if they get you herded into the larger cities

672
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:40,960
and yesterday i read from wired news out of the newest darpa document where they say everything

673
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:46,560
you do will be tracked and traced and you will be plugged in to this system i'm sure you saw all the

674
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:52,560
you saw all the newscast in the same exact words in the same order uh that wired article in case

675
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:57,120
you did not listen to our last episode was about a research proposal that darpa had for a program

676
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:02,640
called life log uh which didn't end up happening and we're not in the matrix we're not so or are

677
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:10,960
we we wouldn't know uh exhausting yes so um i feel exhausted by those sorts of questions where you're

678
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:18,480
like well maybe we are what is totally totally great yeah um fun alex finds it painful to watch

679
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:24,320
movies like the matrix it was painful but he's still gonna buy a copy well of course

680
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:32,000
this is real truth is stranger than fiction and to have the illuminati shout at me for two hours was

681
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:46,000
very very painful uh i was nauseated during the first 30 minutes of the film i will have to of

682
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,240
course when it's on dvd get a copy and try to freeze frame it now i'll still give him my money

683
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:58,560
but you know like i will i just am i i'm just blown away by that statement out of a human

684
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:03,120
after what he said yeah i mean like he thinks that the illuminati yelled at him for two hours

685
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:07,440
and part of that was a powerade commercial yeah that he took personally was the powerade

686
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:11,360
commercial on the original dvd or do you have to get the director's cut i think i played in

687
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:16,720
theaters you can find it on youtube okay i found it um so anyway this this movie was the most

688
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:23,600
gripping that's a positive review word right yeah it tends to be it's a gripping instance of mind

689
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:30,960
control i mean it's hard to keep people entertained for two hours it's difficult uh there were other

690
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:36,160
subliminals here i'm not sure exactly what the covert subliminals were they're really good then

691
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:41,840
in the front of the film at higher levels and then saturated in emotional scenes when your

692
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:48,480
conscious mind is diverted in the primitive combat function mammalian activity structure

693
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:57,920
so this is what we're facing i recommend that uh you do not see the film i know the

694
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:04,560
reverse psychology will probably see it though curiosity killed the cat i was i felt like

695
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:10,960
walking out of the film it was the most gripping but i'm gonna buy it overt mind control i have

696
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:18,000
ever experienced i don't know if you could do a better commercial for the matrix movie to alex's

697
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,280
audience than that yeah like that is catnip to them they will they're all gonna flock to the

698
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:32,000
theater to like like oh my god i was able to resist the mind control no it's like one of those

699
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,560
it's like one of those uh marketing strategies where they try and piss off christians because

700
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:42,080
then they know real people will watch it and be like oh i get it you know this is fun i'm doing

701
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:49,040
this to make whiny old church ladies angry at me yeah so this next clip just confused me okay

702
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:56,640
the oldest form of mind control is superstition the witch doctor

703
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:06,480
knew when the solar or lunar eclipse was coming it's really offensive and he was generally part

704
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:14,400
of a hereditary guild or kind of your first masonic lodge no and he didn't know why there

705
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,640
was an eclipse but he knew when it was coming and it happened so infrequently that people would

706
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:23,040
forget about it he could use that knowledge to shock and amaze members of the tribe

707
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:30,240
and then get special favors the best hut the best women the best food so i guess according to alex

708
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:39,200
like witch doctors are illuminati i think that's what he's saying man i will tell you this right

709
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:46,080
now yeah i think the thing that scares him more than the matrix reloaded more than uh oblivion

710
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:53,920
that's weekend at bernie's too because if you recall i think we all know what happened to uh

711
00:58:53,920 --> 00:59:00,320
bernie in that situation was there an eclipse he was brought back to life and ambulatory by a uh

712
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:06,480
what we we would have called at the time a witch doctor yeah i i know that i've heard these sorts

713
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:12,960
of ideas from alex and they they come from like weird colonial era literature totally uh about

714
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:20,160
the like uh the horrible depictions of yeah uh folks um the i i know that i've heard these

715
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:27,040
thoughts but i didn't know that his idea of like shamans being part of a guild an ancestral guild

716
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:32,160
sure i didn't know that part of it which i think is really funny i think that's hilarious to

717
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:38,160
imagine that he thinks that all of these these shamans or whatever uh yeah they were somehow

718
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:44,240
linked up back in the day and you know what they got the best huts that's i just that's what the

719
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:53,440
scam was what a fucking ignorant and racist thing to think without learning anything about it at all

720
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:59,360
it's interesting to question whether like he got this from some other very misguided source or if

721
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:07,280
he wrote it himself yeah in his head and i'm not sure um so i feel like alex is kind of

722
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:13,760
as it relates to the matrix he's really caught up in it being a little gay when you see a society

723
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:22,160
in decline the empire's always use superstition and gladiatorial diversions to divert and distract

724
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:30,800
them and that's exactly what i saw in the matrix an overall globalist in your face admitting its

725
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:41,040
revelation of the method illuminati terms uh homosexual orgies and much much more this is

726
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:47,920
a corrupting film he brings up way more than once that there's like there are things that are

727
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:53,760
homosexual in nature right that's a real sticking point for him so what he's saying is that the

728
01:00:53,760 --> 01:01:00,960
elites in the middle of a crumbling empire will do their best to distract you with superstition

729
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:11,120
and uh gladiatorial type combats a certain sort uh so that is why alex is giving us the christian

730
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:19,680
point of view of a movie it makes sense yeah fair enough so i thought like man what fun we got a

731
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:25,680
movie review alex was off base on a lot of stuff he's gonna do for the rest of the show yeah i

732
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:30,080
feel like there's there's really nowhere else to go after you've dug into the reloading there's

733
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:35,040
one place to go okay and that's to the phone sure alex takes a call and this guy is uh he's

734
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:40,160
a disabled person and he wants to know what the globalists are going to do with him oh no oh no

735
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:48,080
no 50 years old march and uh anyway i i was my left eye was put out with a rock when i was four

736
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:54,720
so i had to use my right eye uh pretty much all my life and it's getting to where i can hardly read

737
01:01:54,720 --> 01:02:01,840
and uh but i was in a real bad wreck at uh well i had to go on total disability it messed my neck

738
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:10,320
and my spine up and uh i had to become totally disabled and i was just wondering what's going

739
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:15,520
to happen to me when all this stuff comes about they're going to just get away with me they are

740
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:24,880
they are going to uh put you in the compact city and you will live in a small one-room apartment

741
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:31,040
with arm swat teams all about you cameras everywhere thumb scan to get your food and

742
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:35,600
the first time you get sick they're not going to treat you they're going to put you on hospice

743
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:41,760
strap you down and dehydrate you to death it's terrible ain't it well i don't mean to scare you

744
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:47,360
scary doesn't mean to scare him what the fuck was that they're gonna dehydrate you that is so

745
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:55,360
fucking cruel that dude is clearly struggling he's super fucked up yeah he's really just man

746
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:02,640
and then alex just without a fucking thought just makes up some bullshit about how this guy's going

747
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:08,480
to be tortured to death in a small apartment under watch of the swat teams wow they're gonna tie him

748
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:14,880
down and uh dehydrate him is that what that guy was calling and looking for i don't think it's

749
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:21,440
maybe i mean he couldn't possibly have been looking for comfort no no maybe maybe he was

750
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:27,360
looking for something uh to justify his his belief in alex yeah it's like well this is

751
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:32,480
the horrors that they're going to inflict upon someone like me and their dystopian future yes

752
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:37,520
then i must fight and this caller actually does you know i guess he does get what he was looking

753
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:42,400
for he hopes that he can fight to the death uh against these people who would seek to dehydrate

754
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:50,080
him well i just hope god gives me the guts to uh fight to die as patrick and you're dead well you

755
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:57,360
say you have a son yo i got two boys one your job is not to move away and take some jobs and make a

756
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:03,200
little more money their job is to take care of you right yeah they don't take care of you they're

757
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:11,360
going to hell what i mean honor thy father and mother of course that is the commandment more

758
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:18,480
important than all sure uh but also no also no huge no that seemed that seemed a little bit out

759
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:22,480
of place for what i know of alex like your kids got to take care of you they're going to hell

760
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:30,080
what a very strange man yeah what a strange man to react like this to a guy who's clearly in pain

761
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:34,160
yeah and all the time i feel like these are interesting glimpses into things that you know

762
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:38,160
he would say or support but wouldn't really necessarily come up if it weren't for callers

763
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:42,720
yeah totally that's why i kind of enjoy that there's a lot more callers uh in the past also

764
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:48,000
yeah i do like finding out more and more little tiny details of his weird cosmology of like well

765
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,960
obviously if you don't stay with your parents and take care of them until their death you go to hell

766
01:04:52,960 --> 01:05:00,080
yeah yeah satan will uh grab you is that why his dad works there must be must be um so another

767
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:06,160
caller calls in he wants to he's been he's big into relitigating the civil war um here's a couple

768
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:13,920
points okay over a hundred thousand soldiers from the union army deserted lincoln ended up with a

769
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:22,560
general who was a drunk i mean the the odds and the north and later on a president lincoln was

770
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:30,160
like lincoln was a very spiritual man no yeah his wife was in the adult well his wife is a different

771
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:37,440
story i hear you listen i appreciate the call i gotta go and they uh have it weird that lincoln

772
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:44,400
shows up on a episode where he hates homosexuality so much so we get uh alex goes to break and he

773
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:51,120
comes back and he gets another call and uh this guy is just watched a tv show about hitler sure

774
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:57,840
and uh he wants to make some comparisons to george bush i do like these calls too yeah uh the wording

775
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:05,360
uh the phrasing that uh hitler used in his speech before the Reichstag after the Reichstag fire to

776
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:12,720
get uh passage of the enabling act which gave him uh all-encompassing powers did somebody

777
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:18,080
take that i'd like somebody to send me that please i didn't but i certainly hope somebody does because

778
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:24,240
you you will love it alex you're gonna love it so this guy's saying that the phrasing that hitler

779
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:29,840
used yeah and arguing for the enabling act is the same as the phrasing that george bush is using

780
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:34,480
yeah he didn't tape this he has no idea alex hasn't seen it it's just a conversation of people

781
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:40,240
you catch that thing on tv yep okay wild whatever i have a theory i have a theory that i've been

782
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:47,840
working on for a long time which is that part of why we are where we are now is so many people

783
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:55,040
have been so obsessed with watching documentaries about hitler and the rise of uh the nazis that

784
01:06:55,680 --> 01:07:02,480
over time it's turned into a sort of admiration for that for a lot of people which is why we see

785
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:08,320
all of these conversations in comparisons to hitler from the far right about everybody else

786
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:14,240
despite them adopting those tactics tactics almost whole cloth you know what i'm saying yeah i think

787
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:21,600
i think they're like it was effective i think you could learn the wrong lessons yes um so alex and

788
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:27,680
this caller while they're talking about hitler and his speech that is mirroring uh george w bush um

789
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:34,160
they they get into a little bit of a hey let's recast the bush administration but with their

790
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:40,080
sort of their analog in the sure sure sure the hitler administration of course of course

791
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:46,320
the comparison between the bush administration and the hitler administration john ashcroft

792
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:55,120
homeland security patriot act yeah john ashcroft heinrich heinrich heimler heinrich heinrich

793
01:07:55,120 --> 01:08:03,520
heimler yeah and we've got um i guess ridge is kind of the herman guring and cheney is um well

794
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:09,040
i guess kind of a behind the scenes guy but it's it's they're not going to get away with it

795
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,240
it's rumsfeld gabbles

796
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:20,320
it's rumsfeld gerbils gabble's rub spelled gabbles

797
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:27,440
i need to be in more situations where that question is asked of me yeah so john ashcroft

798
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:32,240
was the attorney general for bush this is not analogous to himbler who was the reichfuhrer

799
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:36,960
yeah he was the commander of the ss if you want to be overly generous you could say like he was

800
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:42,320
metaphorically the head of the joint chiefs maybe something like that maybe he was just colon pal

801
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:47,520
tom ridge is the secretary of homeland security right herman gering was the head of the luftwaffe

802
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:51,280
and then he was in control of the reich tag so an equivalent here might be the speaker of the house

803
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:56,080
or maybe vice presidents and so the president of the senate sure sure cheney's behind the scenes

804
01:08:56,080 --> 01:09:01,280
guy with no parallel so i'm gonna ignore that apparently rumsfeld is gerbils which is fucking

805
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:07,840
nuts yeah that's carl rove is gerbils yeah anyone who knows how to book a fantasy nazi team knows

806
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:12,160
that it's a disgrace that alex doesn't like no it's rove yeah it's it's could not have been more

807
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:20,400
rove ever yeah no there's only rove and gerbils like it's those two it's very very simple so

808
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:28,960
gabbles um he had some ideas about uh the big lie that is that is so much like how uh how gabbles

809
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:34,160
he had some ideas about the big lie right you tell a big enough lie and people will believe it

810
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:38,800
bigger lie harder it is for people to you know whatever the big lie alex has some thoughts about

811
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:44,080
that well joseph gabbles was hitler's minister of propaganda he's the one who said when you tell a

812
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:50,000
lie make it big repeat it often and most of the people will believe it and some people say that

813
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:55,360
that quote is i don't ever bother what our enemies do is tell a big lie and tell it often enough but

814
01:09:55,360 --> 01:10:02,640
that they were still explaining what they did i don't know i seem to remember from sarah's book

815
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:09,360
uh as the way i quoted it but i may well be wrong but uh but what i'm saying is some people say that

816
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:14,400
that's taken out of context but no they're explaining how the big lie works regardless

817
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:19,280
it's a statement of fact so some people think that was taken out of context is there anything

818
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:24,640
more american than two old white guys talking about nazis that they haven't bothered to read

819
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:31,200
about so gerbils took the concept of the big lie actually from another source sure from mine comp

820
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:35,680
yeah hitler's book yep the passage in question had to do with hitler blaming everything that

821
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:41,520
went wrong in world war one on the jews the jews had committed a big lie about what had gone down

822
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:46,160
when alex says that gerbils points out that their enemies use a big lie what he's failing to point

823
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:51,520
out is that the actual context of the quote is nazi propaganda against jews yeah the big lie

824
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:57,520
was the bit was the lie about jews being the problem that was the big lie yeah the big lie

825
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:03,360
wasn't the jews lying about their involvement the big lie was telling people that it alex is doing

826
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:09,120
a great job of putting uh history into context for his this is awesome great hey this is the

827
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:15,200
guy who said that hitler and stalin were complete badasses he's read so many books about world war

828
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:22,320
two millions so alex gets another caller and this this is my kind of cat okay he wants to know a

829
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:29,600
very specific question uh he wants the answer uh from alex and that is what bible do you read man

830
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:34,240
and this is a loaded question sure because this means something to this caller obviously he thinks

831
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:40,160
that some uh versions of the bible are not accurate yeah yeah some things like a like a

832
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:45,360
newer version the king james or the niv or whatever it is you'd like there are some books

833
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:51,600
that are added yeah yeah yeah maybe he's somebody who's into some non-canonical books maybe who

834
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:56,960
knows i love this kind of question because it's very specific and there's a specific answer that

835
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:04,000
you should give okay if you're a religious person uh-huh you should have an opinion even if that

836
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:10,560
opinion is i think a lot of different translations sure uh are okay sure you should have an answer

837
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:17,600
alex whiffs uh let's talk to george in colorado thanks for holding george you're on the air

838
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:22,240
yeah how you doing man i'm a first-time listener and uh i gotta know where you stand on a couple

839
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:27,440
of things um on sunday morning when you go to church uh just wondering uh what bible you

840
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:34,560
carried to uh church with you well i don't go to church i don't go to the worship the government

841
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:39,920
and and learn a masonic religion most of these i can't really find a church here locally i

842
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:48,400
occasionally go to tex mars church which is good oh no no oh no no so okay so alex doesn't go to

843
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:55,120
churches but when he does he goes to tex mars noted anti-semite yeah yeah yeah i don't necessarily

844
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:58,400
even believe that i think alex is just grasping at straws and that was the only thing that could

845
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:05,200
come into his mind of like oh this is a crazy uh right wing extremist uh church i can you know sort

846
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:11,120
of signal to yeah um but yeah i mean the caller is just like he wants an answer of like king james

847
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:17,840
all the way baby yeah and alex instead is like i only go to uh uh uh insane anti-semite church

848
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:23,360
yeah yeah i don't go to church where you worship the government it couldn't be more of an important

849
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:28,960
question either because the simple fact is if you want to believe the bible you also have to believe

850
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:34,800
that it was divinely inspired so if there's a difference between two different versions of the

851
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:40,960
bible that would suggest that people got involved somewhere along the line uh at least in one of the

852
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:46,400
versions exactly if there's a discrepancy right so uh this caller is into jesus and that should be

853
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:54,320
enough for alex it's not it's just on a spiritual level here and uh from my from here in colorado

854
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:59,840
it's like the mecca where all these bibles are published and everything and uh and we take a lot

855
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:04,880
of heat and that's what we stand for at our church and uh you know we just believe in the old-time

856
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:11,200
religion and uh and serving the lord jesus christ you know and going out personal soul winning and

857
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:16,640
you know confrontational soul winning and stuff well i don't do that the cashless society control

858
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:21,680
grid of the new world order uh no about uh accepting jesus christ or you know personal

859
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:26,240
faith i mean so your church doesn't talk about the new world order though well no well yeah i

860
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:31,680
mean of course what i mean you know that's in sermons and everything great listen i appreciate

861
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:38,160
the call good to hearing from you george so apparently alex's prerequisite for a church

862
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:44,960
to actually be a church is they have to have his political inclination yes and preach about the

863
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:51,680
new world order it's not enough that they are aggressively and confrontationally into saving

864
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:58,000
souls for jesus yeah that's weird yeah yep yep that's pretty weird yeah you know if there's

865
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:04,720
anything i've always thought about religion it's that it should be in politics non-stop yep so

866
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:11,680
alex gets another caller and this guy is kind of into hitler i believe troy in new york you're on

867
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:17,440
the air go ahead yes uh thank you for allowing me to speak and be heard oh no about the big lie

868
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:24,480
technique the anti-christ accused uh hitler of inventing and propagating the big lie technique

869
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:33,600
this accusation is in fact the big lie technique in action well um you know it's not not the devil

870
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:38,400
who reveals the tricks of the devil it's the anti-devil who reveals the tricks of the devil

871
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:47,440
oh so i guess he's saying that the jews are the devil so wait so the anti-christ toll said that

872
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:53,120
hitler no the anti-christ doesn't reveal the anti-christ plans right it's a good thing to

873
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:59,360
reveal the anti-christ plans in my comp hitler talked about how the jews were to blame right

874
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:04,400
for everything in world war one and the big lie was uh like pointing the finger at nationalist

875
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:10,880
leaders right right and so that is hitler revealing the anti-christ plans which was

876
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:16,240
i mean if you look at it just very clearly saying that the jews are yeah that's basically what he's

877
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:24,800
saying yes yeah that's why i'm concerned right it's concerning issue yes there is a problem

878
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:31,680
especially after you know alex has said that he goes to text mars's church yikes like this is

879
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:38,080
just this is deeply anti-semitic yeah everything that's going on here yeah i don't i but man you

880
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:44,240
could just get away with a lot of shit oh yes oh man and then it gets even worse because uh

881
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:50,800
a name gets dropped and alex although he should be denouncing this person will not

882
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:57,440
because i was hearing that guy forgot his name he's from what was his name is david

883
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:02,800
david j smith waukesa hatchee texas yes yeah and he was saying you know it's a new world order and

884
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:06,080
there's not much that we can do about it because you know it's in the bible and i was just

885
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:11,280
you know uh that's what a lot of people think you know they think well it's in the bible and

886
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:17,440
certainly bad things happen bad things are going to happen but we have a job to warn people to

887
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:23,920
wake folks up and we can do something about that and uh at the same time you know people thought

888
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:28,080
that hitler was the anti-christ you can't fight him at the end of the world some of the christians

889
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:33,760
thought that they thought scallan was they thought mal was so every thug that comes along

890
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:38,320
the churches are being paid off not to speak out and fight it i'm not saying david j smith's doing

891
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:43,920
that he's a good guy i'm talking about the big establishment 501c3s so david j smith is doing

892
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:48,480
the same thing that all of these evil churches are they've been paid off to do it yeah he's saying

893
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:53,120
there's no use in fighting the new world order or whatever but alex is like no he's cool yeah well

894
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:59,840
he's doing it for free um if you don't recall david j smith is the preacher who's super into

895
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:07,120
british isrealism yeah i i do recall that uh very much a white identity uh proponent and yeah the

896
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:12,880
true jews are white people yeah yeah so now we have two examples within like 10 minutes of alex's

897
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:20,640
show of two very anti-semitic preachers uh that alex is a fan of yeah and won't speak ill of uh

898
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:29,200
he's a good guy that's bad man yeah that's that's really bad yeah yeah and especially because one of

899
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:34,000
the things that we've thought for so long is that he went under the radar with his anti-semitism by

900
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:41,600
just renaming it globalism that he's just openly anti-semitic here is kind of mind-boggling like

901
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:47,680
does he hide it later well i think i think that he probably doesn't experience all of this stuff

902
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:53,680
as being as anti-semitic that's true that's true well yeah it is it's super anti-semitic so let's

903
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:58,000
let's take a load off let's get a little bit uh lighter this has been you know some heavy stuff

904
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:03,840
with these calls a lot of a lot of hatred and uh this is just a good fun it's one of the things

905
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:09,200
that i think is is one of the treats one of the delights of going back to the past and that is

906
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:15,520
that there's a running theme that keeps going on through alex's show and that is that people from

907
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:22,720
the republic of texas keep calling and wanting to like get alex's take on things sovereign citizen

908
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:27,360
stuff yes yeah yeah they expect alex to be on board because he wants to secede and what have you

909
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:34,320
but he hates these people uh let's talk to dewayne in texas dewayne you're on the air go ahead

910
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:44,240
oh alex appreciate your uh time and uh the name is wayne not dewayne but wayne and uh i was just

911
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:49,840
checking to see if you have gotten my letter and i think you'll recognize it because it had the

912
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:56,640
texas flag on the envelope and on the letterhead yeah i've got your letter good i need a fax number

913
01:19:56,640 --> 01:20:02,400
from you it's not over the air but you can fax my fax well sir i don't know if i can you know i

914
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:08,000
barely have time to read these letters i understand let's respond to them i understand what's on your

915
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:16,320
mind sir i just received a letter from the uh republican national committee wanting my opinions

916
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:22,000
i answered their questionnaire and then i'm sending them a three-page letter of my opinion

917
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:28,880
yes and what are your opinions well my opinions are that the only way we're going to beat this

918
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:37,680
citizen start small and for texas to start the process for succession and then but to do that

919
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:42,080
we can't have 14 fruitcakes pop up and claim themselves presidents of texas

920
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,720
alex is just so mad at these republic of texas people not a big tent

921
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:58,320
it's not a big enough tent for 14 presidents oh yes i got your letter that that is the

922
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:05,440
that is the that's the moment just that deflation of that that i got your letter that familiarity

923
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:10,800
of like i know exactly who i'm talking to this is happening this is gonna happen is this the

924
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:16,400
president of texas calling in i have to i have to let you talk a little bit because i know

925
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:24,640
so many of my listeners are you and there isn't really all that much uh air between us there's not

926
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:30,080
there's not a real substantive difference between what we believe yeah i just hate you i just hate

927
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:36,880
you because you won't shut up about it i want to talk about the matrix reloaded yeah for an hour

928
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:43,440
yeah and take uh aggressively anti-semitic calls yes and now i have to be like oh the government's

929
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:50,960
a lie so here's how we wrap up uh alex has taken some calls he has a he has a guest uh who talks

930
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:59,760
to for a bit in the third hour um who's someone who ran a um a a union in new mexico and they

931
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:07,520
got evicted uh because they had a uh war protest yeah and great yeah great that is something that

932
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:12,960
you should probably you know you know point out or whatever alex wouldn't do that in the present day

933
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:21,040
no um but also i don't know if i'm really that interested in this because like obviously

934
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:25,520
personally i agree that they shouldn't have been evicted yeah but i understand that having a

935
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:30,720
demonstration could have been a breach of their lease sure so i understand and i don't understand

936
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:38,000
why alex would be against the landlord's right to evict someone for having a rally yeah yeah yeah

937
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:43,520
i don't know it's politically bizarre and i i don't know so they talk for a bit in one way i

938
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:49,920
am like you know part of protest is that there are going to be consequences for it you can't protest

939
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:56,480
and think that it's not a protest if no one is going to fight back you know that's just uh advice

940
01:22:56,480 --> 01:23:03,360
much like um much like uh the matrix too need to be stakes yes absolutely and then on the other

941
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:10,160
hand fuck you yeah you for evicting them fair enough yeah uh so here's the last clip and we

942
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:17,120
posted an article on infowars.com about the mara maraginian bloodline what they talk about matrix

943
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:23,680
too i don't suggest it's mind control folks i've seen it it's mind control man i control folks i've

944
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:27,600
seen it someone like me is strong enough to stand up to the mind control you might not be don't go

945
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:35,760
ahead do you know how strong he is he can't he can't be mind control he's going to buy the movie

946
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:41,680
just so he can test himself against its mind control or dan it's good practice or dan perhaps

947
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:45,600
all of the mind control that he was concerned about is not the mind control they were thinking

948
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:51,440
about maybe they were mind controlling him into buying the dvd yeah he also uh has a fridge full

949
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:57,760
of powerade and he doesn't know why exactly yes i'm so mad at powerade he's chugging powerade and

950
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:02,800
saying these mind tricks don't work on me the only way to get rid of powerade is to drink it all

951
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:07,760
that's true that's what's gonna happen i'm gonna drink the whole business dry powerade is a finite

952
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:12,880
resource and eventually i'll get to the end of it eventually we're gonna run out of power and i'll

953
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:19,520
teach them i'll show them i'll give them all my money yeah so i guess in terms of this the the

954
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:24,960
you know obviously they needed to get to the point where he actually sees the movie yes that's great

955
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:29,120
yeah and in terms of preparation for an episode this included me watching a movie so right you

956
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:34,640
know that's a nice little derivation from the norm fun um but yeah we'll be back uh on our

957
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:39,440
