00:12.880 --> 00:17.920
Dan and Jordan, I am sweating

00:17.920 --> 00:21.040
knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray

00:21.040 --> 00:23.840
I have great respect for knowledgefight

00:23.840 --> 00:24.960
knowledgefight

00:24.960 --> 00:27.280
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

00:27.280 --> 00:28.800
saying we are the bad guys

00:28.800 --> 00:29.840
knowledgefight

00:29.840 --> 00:31.920
Dan and Jordan, knowledgefight

00:34.320 --> 00:39.280
I need money

00:39.280 --> 00:42.640
A&E In Kansas, A&E in Kansas, A&E in Stop It

00:42.640 --> 00:46.960
A&E in Kansas, A&E in Kansas, A&E in It's time to pray

00:46.960 --> 00:49.200
A&E in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding us

00:49.200 --> 00:51.600
Hello Alex, I'm a first-time caller, I'm a huge fan

00:51.600 --> 00:52.800
I love your room

00:56.720 --> 00:57.720
I love you.

00:57.720 --> 00:58.720
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight.

00:58.720 --> 00:59.720
I'm Dan.

00:59.720 --> 01:00.720
I'm Jordan.

01:00.720 --> 01:01.720
We're a couple dudes.

01:01.720 --> 01:05.200
I'd like to sit around and worship at the altar of Selene and talk a little bit about

01:05.200 --> 01:06.200
Alex Jones.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.200
Oh, indeed we are, Dan.

01:07.200 --> 01:08.200
Jordan.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.200
Dan.

01:09.200 --> 01:10.200
Jordan.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.200
I have a quick question for you.

01:11.200 --> 01:12.200
What's up?

01:12.200 --> 01:13.200
What's your bright spot today?

01:13.200 --> 01:16.400
My bright spot today, this is actually a bright spot I'm excited to give or to discuss.

01:16.400 --> 01:17.520
All right.

01:17.520 --> 01:21.840
I was a fan of The Tick growing up.

01:21.840 --> 01:22.840
Oh, hell yeah.

01:22.840 --> 01:23.840
The animated cartoon?

01:23.840 --> 01:24.840
Cartoon.

01:24.840 --> 01:25.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:25.840 --> 01:26.840
I loved it.

01:26.840 --> 01:27.840
Deflator Mouse, come on, man.

01:27.840 --> 01:28.840
Chairface Chippendale.

01:28.840 --> 01:29.840
Of course.

01:29.840 --> 01:30.840
It doesn't get better than that.

01:30.840 --> 01:31.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:31.840 --> 01:32.840
Great.

01:32.840 --> 01:33.840
Loved it.

01:33.840 --> 01:34.840
Fantastic.

01:34.840 --> 01:39.560
The sensibility of it, the humor, everything about it was just fantastic.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.560
I loved it as a kid.

01:41.560 --> 01:48.640
I have always been a little bit hesitant to give other interpretations of The Tick a chance.

01:48.640 --> 01:52.480
I tried watching the newer one.

01:52.480 --> 01:53.480
Which one?

01:53.480 --> 01:54.480
The Patrick Warburton one?

01:54.480 --> 01:55.480
No.

01:55.480 --> 01:56.480
The Peter Serafinowicz one.

01:56.480 --> 01:57.480
Gotcha.

01:57.480 --> 01:58.480
Yeah.

01:58.480 --> 01:59.480
Peter Serafinowicz is great, isn't he?

01:59.480 --> 02:00.480
It's outstanding.

02:00.480 --> 02:01.480
It's so good.

02:01.480 --> 02:02.480
Yes.

02:02.480 --> 02:03.480
It's so good.

02:03.480 --> 02:08.080
I'm a few episodes in and I'm like, this is exactly what I would have wanted from a live

02:08.080 --> 02:09.960
action version of The Tick.

02:09.960 --> 02:10.960
Totally.

02:10.960 --> 02:11.960
Spectacular.

02:11.960 --> 02:12.960
Yeah.

02:12.960 --> 02:14.680
There's so many little subtle things.

02:14.680 --> 02:19.640
I would never have guessed that Serafinowicz would get the character that good.

02:19.640 --> 02:20.640
You know what I'm saying?

02:20.640 --> 02:22.040
And Griffin Newman's fantastic as Arthur.

02:22.040 --> 02:23.040
Totally.

02:23.040 --> 02:24.040
No, no, he's great.

02:24.040 --> 02:28.760
But at least the first episodes are really hinging around him and this sort of backstory

02:28.760 --> 02:30.760
of him as a superhero.

02:30.760 --> 02:31.760
Totally.

02:31.760 --> 02:34.560
And that's exactly the way to tell the story.

02:34.560 --> 02:36.200
It's really good.

02:36.200 --> 02:37.320
I am so pumped.

02:37.320 --> 02:41.520
I'm bummed that I think it's canceled, right?

02:41.520 --> 02:44.400
I'm pretty sure it's canceled, yeah.

02:44.400 --> 02:48.980
Sucks that there's a limited amount of them, but I'm excited to have something to watch

02:48.980 --> 02:50.120
that I really enjoy.

02:50.120 --> 02:52.400
Yeah, that was one of my favorites.

02:52.400 --> 02:58.180
I'll never forget Deflator Mouse, just because I saw the cartoon when I was eight or something.

02:58.180 --> 02:59.180
So young.

02:59.180 --> 03:04.000
And it was like 20 years later that I was like, oh, that's a reference to a fucking

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
opera?

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Shit!

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
You know?

03:07.000 --> 03:12.860
What kind of eight year old is going to be like, what a great pun?

03:12.860 --> 03:15.640
Was The Mad Bomber Who Bombs at Midnight a pun?

03:15.640 --> 03:20.020
I do like The Mad Bomber Who Bombs at Midnight.

03:20.020 --> 03:21.120
So what's your bright spot?

03:21.120 --> 03:24.360
My bright spot, Dan, is walking.

03:24.360 --> 03:25.360
Not Christopher.

03:25.360 --> 03:26.360
Oh.

03:26.360 --> 03:27.360
Ah, no.

03:27.360 --> 03:31.240
The weather's nice out, and we only live a couple miles away from each other, so I've

03:31.240 --> 03:33.800
started walking to do the show.

03:33.800 --> 03:38.200
It's about a 40 minute walk, which is the perfect length of time to start going back

03:38.200 --> 03:41.000
through old albums and actually listen to the full thing.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Oh, yeah.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.380
Yeah, I've been going through the Ninja Tunes label here recently, and I just got to Lemon

03:47.380 --> 03:55.720
Jellies 64 through 95, and the final track on that is called Go, and it is so good because

03:55.720 --> 04:02.300
they use William Shatner's sample there, and so it's just like they finally do something

04:02.300 --> 04:03.640
good with William Shatner.

04:03.640 --> 04:09.840
It's been so long, but they finally did something good with William Shatner around 20 years

04:09.840 --> 04:10.840
ago.

04:10.840 --> 04:12.180
What about those talk albums that he did?

04:12.180 --> 04:13.180
That's what they're doing.

04:13.180 --> 04:14.640
They're taking samples from the talk albums.

04:14.640 --> 04:17.480
But I think that even just those raw are great.

04:17.480 --> 04:18.480
Oh, you think so?

04:18.480 --> 04:19.480
Really?

04:19.480 --> 04:20.480
No, I don't know.

04:20.480 --> 04:21.480
I actually haven't listened to them.

04:21.480 --> 04:22.480
I know a lot of people make jokes about it.

04:22.480 --> 04:23.480
Yeah, I mean, it's easy to make jokes about it.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.280
What are you going to say about it?

04:25.280 --> 04:26.280
It's good?

04:26.280 --> 04:29.640
I guess that's as good a joke as I have.

04:29.640 --> 04:30.640
This is good.

04:30.640 --> 04:32.400
Hey, look, we're going to put this on on a date.

04:32.400 --> 04:35.240
We're going to lower the lights a little bit and just listen to some Shatner.

04:35.240 --> 04:37.240
And make out to some Shatner.

04:37.240 --> 04:38.240
Exactly.

04:38.240 --> 04:39.240
Yes.

04:39.240 --> 04:40.240
What are you doing?

04:40.240 --> 04:41.240
Yeah.

04:41.240 --> 04:42.240
So, Jordan.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.240
Yes, sir.

04:43.240 --> 04:44.240
I'm glad you're enjoying these albums.

04:44.240 --> 04:46.400
And today we have an album to discuss.

04:46.400 --> 04:47.400
Oh, yeah.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.400
And that is an episode of Alex's show.

04:49.400 --> 04:50.400
Okay.

04:50.400 --> 04:51.400
I look at those as albums.

04:51.400 --> 04:52.400
Okay.

04:52.400 --> 04:53.400
Yeah.

04:53.400 --> 04:54.400
All right.

04:54.400 --> 04:55.400
He's prolific.

04:55.400 --> 04:56.400
Very.

04:56.400 --> 04:57.400
Yes.

04:57.400 --> 04:58.400
We're going over May 21st, 2003.

04:58.400 --> 04:59.400
Blackjack.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.400
No.

05:00.400 --> 05:01.400
God damn it.

05:01.400 --> 05:02.400
I bet.

05:02.400 --> 05:03.400
Oh, shit.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.400
We're going back to the past.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.400
Okay.

05:05.400 --> 05:09.680
And part of this is because we had a little bit of sort of a cliffhanger on the last episode.

05:09.680 --> 05:11.480
Alex was complaining a whole bunch about The Matrix.

05:11.480 --> 05:12.480
Yep.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.480
And he was saying he was going to go see it.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.480
Of course.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.480
And he did not.

05:15.480 --> 05:16.480
And he didn't.

05:16.480 --> 05:17.480
So we have to satisfy this.

05:17.480 --> 05:19.120
We have to give some sort of closure to this.

05:19.120 --> 05:20.120
Yeah.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.120
Of course.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.600
And I will say that Alex has seen The Matrix by this point, and we're going to get one

05:23.600 --> 05:25.600
of those rare gems.

05:25.600 --> 05:27.080
Solid movie reviews.

05:27.080 --> 05:29.440
We're going to get a gem of a movie review out of Alex.

05:29.440 --> 05:30.440
Okay.

05:30.440 --> 05:31.440
I'm excited.

05:31.440 --> 05:32.440
Yeah.

05:32.440 --> 05:33.440
As am I. I'm thrilled to walk you through this.

05:33.440 --> 05:37.400
But before we do, we've got to take a moment to say hello to some new wonks out there.

05:37.400 --> 05:38.400
That's a great idea.

05:38.400 --> 05:39.760
So first, Steven T. Thank you so much.

05:39.760 --> 05:41.000

you can say that life is a disease that ends in death so Jordan um today we're going to be

07:53.360 --> 07:59.760
talking about uh Alex on the on may 21st and I this is a rare instance where I decided like

08:00.320 --> 08:06.320
I have not watched these movies in forever it's been a long time and so I decided I might need

08:06.320 --> 08:14.400
to refresh my memory and I actually watched the matrix reloaded as a as a sort of refresher course

08:14.400 --> 08:20.000
because I was like what is he talking about even when it comes to movie reviews Dan's gonna look

08:20.000 --> 08:25.200
into it and research things and take down your opinion well I was curious I was curious because

08:25.200 --> 08:31.600
I remember enjoying uh the movie enough sure and and look I have a lot of things I'm gonna read

08:31.600 --> 08:38.960
some of my my notes uh just sort of raw yeah uh go over some of my thoughts are you doing a live

08:38.960 --> 08:45.040
tweeting of uh I basically did uh on a notebook page um I'm gonna go over a little bit but this

08:45.040 --> 08:55.040
was uh not bad not a bad not a bad film I enjoyed it I would appreciate more movie reviews that were

08:55.040 --> 09:00.960
just very simple a couple words I'm sick of these long like explanations of the plot and the history

09:00.960 --> 09:06.480
of the movie and the shots angle and what that means for interpretation no it's all right it

09:06.480 --> 09:12.080
really picked up after the highway scene yeah that's true I will say that that's true a little

09:12.080 --> 09:18.080
bit of at the beginning was a slog to get through but whatever no everybody wants to watch the

09:18.080 --> 09:24.400
dancing scene for at least another six minutes it had some pacing issues um but I don't begrudge

09:24.400 --> 09:29.360
that too much it wasn't it wasn't insurmountable in terms of enjoying the movie no no no um

09:30.240 --> 09:36.640
like I said I have some thoughts so does Alex last night I went and saw the matrix I'm gonna give

09:36.640 --> 09:42.160
about a five minute review of that and I think a transcript of my review should be made I want to

09:42.160 --> 09:49.600
give a warning about this film if there was any questions about being uh from Illuminati origin

09:49.600 --> 09:57.840
those are now answered put those concerns to bed is it yes oh yeah okay it is a deeply Illuminati

09:57.840 --> 10:02.560
shit just for the listeners I need you to know that when Alex said I'm gonna give you about a

10:02.560 --> 10:08.080
five minute review Dan just went shook his head no it is not gonna be a five minute review nor

10:08.080 --> 10:17.120
should it be transcribed all of that was wrong um yeah so apparently uh Alex had seen the first

10:17.120 --> 10:23.520
Matrix movie sure and he was like is this Illuminati shit I don't know and he saw the second

10:23.520 --> 10:30.560
one he's like yes definitely Illuminati shit I do like that the concerns have been put to bed put

10:30.560 --> 10:36.720
them to bed put the concerns to bed yeah because the answer is yes which is somehow less concerning

10:36.720 --> 10:41.520
well I mean it's it's no longer an open question now you know that this is just evil I mean I

10:41.520 --> 10:47.520
suppose certainty is a comfort in some ways right yeah so I guess at this point I would say that um

10:47.520 --> 10:53.120
if you're convinced that this uh movie has Illuminati origins maybe you shouldn't do that

10:53.120 --> 10:58.000
whole red pill thing like maybe you shouldn't take that metaphor because the Illuminati made

10:58.000 --> 11:05.520
that metaphor so so what you're saying is perhaps these stupid thoughts uh are bullshit that they're

11:05.520 --> 11:09.280
feeling in the moment and then later on they'll be like that's actually a great movie and let's

11:09.280 --> 11:13.280
use the metaphor yes yeah that sounds I get the sense of that yeah that sounds about right um so

11:13.280 --> 11:19.360
there's a lot of people who shouldn't see this movie humans yes but if you're gonna see it you

11:19.360 --> 11:26.160
whatever just don't show it to kids I would not let my children watch the film and uh if you want

11:26.160 --> 11:35.600
to see it yourself to see the face of the new world order go ahead but uh it uh very very dark

11:35.600 --> 11:42.400
and very evil uh is all I can really say about Matrix Reloaded but uh I'm gonna

11:43.760 --> 11:50.320
go over some of it here on the show he does he does go over a little bit of it yeah I will say

11:50.320 --> 11:56.640
that from I listened to Alex's review first got confused and then I watched the movie I'm like

11:56.640 --> 11:58.160
boy there's a lot he doesn't cover

12:02.560 --> 12:06.960
he would not have a very good sense of the movie it's a big movie it's a big movie yeah there might

12:06.960 --> 12:13.840
be too much in it but um you know he he starts off his conversation about uh the Matrix by talking

12:13.840 --> 12:20.800
about the first movie and I don't know if I agree with his premise okay the first Matrix was

12:20.800 --> 12:34.160
obviously new age in its overall presentation that you've got to believe in yourself and then you can

12:34.160 --> 12:40.480
change the parameters that is not no reality no problem within I take issue with that I mean like

12:40.480 --> 12:45.360
maybe there is some new ageiness to it certainly sure sure but I don't think that it's about like

12:46.080 --> 12:50.640
believe in yourself and you can change the parameters of reality I am fairly certain

12:50.640 --> 12:55.520
that most everybody in that movie who also believed in themselves right next to Neo

12:56.080 --> 13:01.440
was immediately murdered within the first 45 minutes yeah Neo didn't have the ability to

13:01.440 --> 13:05.600
change things because he believed in himself he had the ability to change things because he was

13:05.600 --> 13:12.000
created and born inside the Matrix yeah I understand maybe that you're trying to say

13:12.000 --> 13:16.960
that we're all the chosen one but that's not what the movie is trying to say yes yes if you're going

13:16.960 --> 13:22.880
to bring that to the film that's on you yeah I mean and for fuck's sakes in one movie later

13:22.880 --> 13:28.960
after this one Neo is literally in a Christ-like position to show you that he's making the

13:28.960 --> 13:35.920
sacrifice spoilers I'm sorry apologies I have to get to that a couple years from now it's Alex

13:36.960 --> 13:42.480
freaks out about that now you got to go hunting for when Revolutions was released oh god I can't

13:42.480 --> 13:48.880
wait um yeah I think his interpretation of the first movie is a little bit flawed yeah

13:49.840 --> 13:54.320
based on everything about the first movie yes the and the watching of it but he you know he

13:54.320 --> 14:01.440
watched this this the first film and like I said he was confused he's like is this illuminati how

14:01.440 --> 14:07.360
do you get confused well because you don't know if it's illuminati or not maybe the Wachowskis

14:07.360 --> 14:13.920
are putting out something that is heroic sure anti-illuminati sure or maybe it's illuminati

14:14.720 --> 14:22.320
and so I was ambiguous I'm certainly a Christian and didn't follow the new age Hindu or Buddhist

14:22.320 --> 14:32.800
line but I was still overall not sure if the film was a production of the globalist

14:34.400 --> 14:41.840
what well now I am sure that the matrix one and the matrix two matrix reloaded are

14:42.880 --> 14:51.120
in the most pure sense illuminati productions so I was pretty excited to hear about like

14:51.120 --> 14:57.840
why yeah in the most pure sense what sealed the deal what was it about this film that was like

14:57.840 --> 15:02.400
yeah no dead to rights this is this is globalist I need to know I mean did you just watch the

15:02.400 --> 15:08.240
credits and the executive producers were the illuminati sorrow exactly like is that what

15:08.240 --> 15:17.680
we're dealing with I was not prepared for how this review would get going okay I I was like okay

15:17.680 --> 15:23.040
he's gonna misinterpret something sure you know I couldn't have possibly imagined that this was

15:23.040 --> 15:29.760
the start of it look down for this okay it's outrageous the film begins obviously with a

15:29.760 --> 15:39.120
group of trailers and there is a wide screen shot that has been squeezed down and distorted

15:39.120 --> 15:51.600
as an authority figure type man in black sits behind a table with flickering subliminals being

15:51.600 --> 16:00.640
splashed on the screen talking about power aid alex is mad about a power aid commercial I am no

16:00.640 --> 16:09.600
I am no uh you know what it I was I was I was out when he said before we even get to the movie

16:09.600 --> 16:14.800
we got to deal with the trailers yeah no no no no no I don't even why would the illuminati count

16:14.800 --> 16:20.080
trailers this isn't even a trailer this is a commercial power raid yes I thought he was

16:20.080 --> 16:25.200
misinterpreting a fucking uh commercial for men in black 2 or something like rip torn is sitting

16:25.200 --> 16:30.240
behind a desk it's not it's not we'll get into it but he's really mad about okay okay it's a power

16:30.240 --> 16:34.240
talks down to you and says you're not even going to understand what I'm saying to you

16:35.040 --> 16:44.720
you pathetic mindless hive mind of units you are units that power the matrix drink your power aid

16:46.160 --> 16:48.480
do as you are ordered to do

16:50.960 --> 16:54.320
so that's how the film begins it's not it's a commercial

16:54.320 --> 17:00.720
um it's not how the film begins it's really not how the film begins if you watch it like now if

17:00.720 --> 17:06.640
you were to stream it it doesn't start the power a commercial isn't there no so this wasn't an

17:06.640 --> 17:11.600
authority figure in the commercial it was one of the agents from the movie there weren't subliminal

17:11.600 --> 17:15.520
flickering lights the commercial was just set in the entire great interrogation room where they

17:15.520 --> 17:20.320
took neo in the first movie sure some of the stuff that alex is saying is from the commercial but

17:20.320 --> 17:26.160
some is also his own embellishment but it's obviously just a way to like sell power aid

17:26.160 --> 17:30.720
using a character from the movie yeah i spent a lot of time thinking about it and honestly this

17:30.720 --> 17:36.240
is the only way you could do a commercial like this with a tie-in to the matrix like if you use

17:36.240 --> 17:42.400
any of the main characters it's gonna really seem goofy as shit oh no no the agent would be great

17:42.400 --> 17:47.440
they're perfect for this because they don't have a personality except for agent smith so they're

17:47.440 --> 17:51.520
essentially just blank slates yeah one of them selling power aid doesn't negatively affect your

17:51.520 --> 17:58.000
impression of the agents because it can't they aren't individuals right so it's fine that said

17:58.000 --> 18:02.160
i went and watched this commercial uh and there is a canon problem with the commercial okay

18:03.280 --> 18:07.920
i'm gonna play a little clip here uh from that commercial and then we'll discuss uh the issue

18:07.920 --> 18:15.440
i love this show consider this the active human body can generate up to 12 000 btus of body heat

18:15.440 --> 18:24.160
pure precious life-giving energy it is unfortunate your collective puny little minds couldn't figure

18:24.160 --> 18:31.840
out a way to harness this energy put it to good use somehow but that's beside the point the point

18:31.840 --> 18:40.720
is to keep generating all that energy your body needs to be replenished so drink your power aid

18:40.720 --> 18:45.760
we have quotas to meet so that's obviously supposed to be like deadpan comedy yeah yeah

18:45.760 --> 18:50.560
the problem is that this agent is trying to sell power aid to people who are inside the matrix

18:50.560 --> 18:54.320
activities inside the matrix shouldn't affect the amount of energy that gets produced by the

18:54.320 --> 19:00.160
person's physical body outside of the matrix people's actual bodies are in pods they have

19:00.160 --> 19:04.880
no need for power aid there's tubes and stuff going into them i do believe that they are

19:04.880 --> 19:09.200
suspended in goo of some sort you wouldn't even be able to get that power to their mouths power

19:09.200 --> 19:14.240
is it power aid that they're suspended it might be that could be true if so this commercial is

19:14.240 --> 19:19.840
underselling if you don't have power aid you will die yeah given what we know about the machines in

19:19.840 --> 19:24.960
the movies if physical activity in the matrix translated to greater energy production in the

19:24.960 --> 19:31.120
real world then everyone in the matrix would be suspiciously into exercise and fitness if you have

19:31.120 --> 19:35.840
like seven billion batteries and you could boost their productivity by 30 if their avatar of the

19:35.840 --> 19:41.200
matrix works out that's an amount of energy production that would not be ignored by machines

19:41.200 --> 19:45.760
no no no generally they are well known for efficiency they keep humans in pods

19:48.240 --> 19:52.800
anything is on the table that's what i'm saying i do like the idea that there's somebody somewhere

19:52.800 --> 19:59.920
like man nobody is using these gym memberships nobody this is unreal this is unreal anyway

19:59.920 --> 20:05.520
the bottom line here is that uh this commercial is just kind of dumb it's kind of just a fun

20:05.520 --> 20:09.440
powerade commercial that played before the movie it's not part of the film and it's not meant to

20:09.440 --> 20:17.040
shame people for being dumb like there's an ai version of irkot it's like sorry guys nobody's

20:17.040 --> 20:23.200
working out so you can't turn your ac on this this week like come on man yeah i like i like though

20:23.200 --> 20:28.080
that alex is sitting there in the theater watching this powerade commercial and he's like i am

20:28.080 --> 20:36.400
personally insulted by this character talking down to me all you need i i have been shamed by this

20:36.400 --> 20:46.000
powerade commercial wow you just can't find a single moment not to be mad about yeah if you

20:46.000 --> 20:50.800
can get mad about a powerade commercial what why even bother with the movie you're already done

20:50.800 --> 20:58.480
yeah what's it like what's it like what's it like how do you take in any media if you're

20:58.480 --> 21:07.760
shamed by a power so the actual movie starts sure and uh here's where alex is at then it launches

21:07.760 --> 21:20.880
into uh the world of the matrix that is the real physical world of the underground base of xion

21:20.880 --> 21:34.480
yes xion get it and you have the marauding forces that that uh surface to the wrecked cities above

21:34.480 --> 21:46.240
and transmit the minds or the souls in a type of digital astral projection okay into the machine

21:46.960 --> 21:55.200
world or the matrix and you're told that both of these are reality because perception is reality

21:55.200 --> 21:59.280
if there's one thing that i took away from the message of the matrix movies even before i went

21:59.280 --> 22:03.600
and re-watched it it's kind of the opposite of perception is reality yeah basically what you

22:03.600 --> 22:08.480
perceive is not real yes that's the point it felt like the point of the movie is that some things

22:08.480 --> 22:14.800
that feel like reality might not be but there is a definite reality which is worth fighting for

22:14.800 --> 22:19.280
yeah if perception was truly reality then it wouldn't matter if neo ever perceived the matrix

22:19.280 --> 22:23.920
to be the actual world or an illusion if he accepted the matrix as reality then it would

22:23.920 --> 22:30.080
actually be that the movies do actually deal with this quite eloquently perception can shape reality

22:30.080 --> 22:34.960
to an extent like if you're in the matrix and you want that to be a reality it's possible to

22:34.960 --> 22:40.320
live your entire life in that state and not run into any problems joey pants his character in the

22:40.320 --> 22:44.720
first movie he wants to be reinserted into the matrix and not be aware of the fight against the

22:44.720 --> 22:49.040
robots because it's more comfortable to him and it's implied that that's something that can be

22:49.040 --> 22:56.240
done his subjective experience and perception can create his subjective reality but that isn't real

22:56.240 --> 23:00.640
the movie is very clear that there's an entirely different actual reality that exists regardless

23:00.640 --> 23:06.480
of your subjective beliefs about reality nothing you do in the matrix affects that fact as the what

23:06.480 --> 23:13.040
is reality robots have turned humans into batteries and shit in the first movie the first

23:13.040 --> 23:20.080
thing he does is show you the desert of the real the real not not the desert of the we perceive

23:20.080 --> 23:25.360
this to be dark it's really interesting to me that this is this is where alex is at because

23:25.360 --> 23:29.840
he's getting caught up in a pretty elementary philosophical question about perception and

23:29.840 --> 23:35.760
reality that the wachowski's movie actually goes one step beyond in terms of like even just the

23:35.760 --> 23:40.720
starting point is past this i think that's what we're really dealing with here it's like when

23:40.720 --> 23:45.760
you're when you're watching he sounds like he's explaining the movie to my grandma you know of

23:45.760 --> 23:50.640
just like things that aren't really part of the movie but she's gonna like it a lot more than if

23:50.640 --> 23:55.920
you tell her like there's a car chase you know like that's not what's gonna work for her yep

23:56.960 --> 24:04.000
so trinity jumps on a motorcycle yeah right okay wearing black spandex it looks great um so zion

24:04.000 --> 24:09.760
he takes issue with uh-huh he takes issue with like weird things uh specifically about like

24:09.760 --> 24:13.520
naming conventions yeah but when i went back and i watched it i was like it's interesting that he

24:13.520 --> 24:19.120
doesn't take issue with everything yeah everything has a fucking name that means something it's kind

24:19.120 --> 24:24.000
of a reference to everything yeah and so the zion stuck out in his head and then here's another one

24:24.640 --> 24:36.000
and the whole film is basically illuminati characters dark masonic overtones with a dark

24:36.000 --> 24:42.240
occult leader and he says that we are the occult we're the vampires we're the werewolves we're the

24:42.240 --> 24:49.200
demons nope absolutely not him that and of course he's called the merovingian or the merovingian

24:49.200 --> 24:54.960
bloodline this is what the satanist based in france believe that they are descendants of jesus

24:54.960 --> 25:00.320
and he's brothers with satan this is deep occult illuminati stuff so alex takes issue with the

25:00.320 --> 25:07.680
merovingian he's not a good guy nope okay we're we all recognize that he's bad yeah that's why

25:07.680 --> 25:13.360
he's got that name yeah and he's not even like high-end villain he's he's an antagonist he's a

25:13.360 --> 25:18.480
middle manager yeah yeah yeah he is the mini boss of this side quest totally they have to go get

25:18.480 --> 25:25.760
the key maker yes yeah yeah yeah um yeah i guess it's you know zion and merovingian you can take

25:25.760 --> 25:29.200
some issue with those but what about like Nebuchadnezzar was the name of their ship

25:29.200 --> 25:34.560
yeah yeah yeah what about trinity no don't worry about it no don't worry about it no

25:34.560 --> 25:42.240
morpheus absolutely no reference there dan it's it's interesting the selective uh sort of outrage

25:42.240 --> 25:46.800
or selective like pointing this out as sure something that means something without without

25:46.800 --> 25:52.960
incorporating all of the things right into it like it just it's pick and choose yeah i mean

25:53.760 --> 26:00.000
if you name something zion in a piece of popular culture someone's gonna be pissed and it's usually

26:00.000 --> 26:04.560
and it's usually gonna be hard right christians it's gonna be alex in 2003 exactly yes that's

26:04.560 --> 26:09.360
going to happen but if you're mad about that you can't you can't let that get in the way of being

26:09.360 --> 26:14.000
mad about all the other religious references in the movie you know that's the problem here he

26:14.000 --> 26:20.800
needs to be a more holistic hater yeah so the movie it's evil that's that's i mean really the

26:20.800 --> 26:25.440
bottom line and again i'm showing you about small tidbits of this i've got to go back and take notes

26:25.440 --> 26:33.680
which i will do this is a i've never seen a more powerful overtly soul twisting mind control film

26:34.240 --> 26:39.680
there is lesbian and homosexual scenes in the film oh my god oh my god the fucking

26:39.680 --> 26:44.160
illuminati are back at it dan why is that the first thing that he brings up after saying that

26:44.160 --> 26:54.240
it's mind twisting and evil because i urges it's very weird to me it's very strange even for alex

26:54.240 --> 27:02.160
that's weird yeah there's homosexual and lesbian scenes yeah yeah 2003 was uh was different though

27:02.160 --> 27:09.760
like uh you know that was before gay people were even allowed to marry it's true so uh i i think

27:09.760 --> 27:16.560
there was a lot more open and vicious uh uh well i mean now there's so much open and vicious hatred

27:16.560 --> 27:25.040
man the world sucks bummer yep um so look this is all just trying to make implants fashionable

27:25.040 --> 27:30.560
right body mods yeah yeah jacks in the back of your head yeah and living in the future now

27:30.560 --> 27:34.400
that's been born out oh yeah we all have jacks we all have jacks in the back of our head yeah

27:35.280 --> 27:43.680
uh there also is everyone has chip implants and chip plug-ins and this is a good thing

27:43.680 --> 27:48.800
good thing we have a little speech in there where the machines aren't bad we can fight them with all

27:48.800 --> 27:55.280
of all of this so it's making it a new fashion statement probably one of the strongest cultural

27:56.000 --> 28:03.280
movements we've seen in history in modern history is the matrix the video games and the cartoons now

28:03.280 --> 28:14.800
in the a bunch of spin-off uh cartoons for the big screen and dvd there was they again are

28:14.800 --> 28:20.880
conditioning the children the anime that it's normal to have plug-ins into your mind wire heads

28:20.880 --> 28:27.760
as they were called decades ago it is fashionable to have implant points all over your body like

28:27.760 --> 28:33.360
okay so matrix was popular right yeah and alex is trying to make this argument that like they're

28:33.360 --> 28:37.920
trying to condition you to get jacks on the back of your head to plug into computers or something

28:37.920 --> 28:43.920
sure but like if your argument is just that it's popular and there's like spin-off properties like

28:44.560 --> 28:50.800
what about the ninja turtles oh yeah like they were huge yeah yeah what about that were they

28:50.800 --> 28:55.600
try what were what were the globalists trying to mainline uh then were they trying to turn us all

28:55.600 --> 29:02.320
into people who go into goo well i know i know that i had and this i remember specifically i had

29:02.320 --> 29:08.560
a rafael action figure and what you would do is you would push rafael's head down and it would

29:08.560 --> 29:13.760
attach to a spring and then you'd uh click it and the head would pop out like he was headbutting you

29:13.760 --> 29:19.040
right and from that i learned that the illuminati want me to headbutt the shit out of people wait

29:19.040 --> 29:26.160
wait a second yeah i know rafael was a ninja turtle true what weapon does neo grab when he's

29:26.160 --> 29:31.920
fighting the mira vingian's goons in that staircase was it was it size he does he does

29:31.920 --> 29:39.360
yes no shit oh wow neo is rafael this is blowing the whole thing wide open for me oh man perception

29:39.360 --> 29:44.880
is reality wait wait ninja turtles were preparing us for the matrix right preparing us to take

29:44.880 --> 29:49.360
the jacks in the back of our head right i mean wasn't it a point of pride in the movie though

29:49.360 --> 29:55.840
how many people were born naturally who didn't have the jacks and were like happy about it i'm

29:55.840 --> 30:01.040
pretty sure that that was a i believe so yeah yeah um also the scene that alex is talking about like

30:01.040 --> 30:06.320
with uh the machines are good or whatever is it's just that scene where the dude takes neo down to

30:06.320 --> 30:14.000
the engineering level yeah in uh in zion yeah and he's like well you know machines suck but also

30:14.000 --> 30:19.280
we gotta use them yeah we wouldn't be able to breathe down here yeah yeah so it's like a win

30:19.280 --> 30:25.040
some lose some situation it was a little heavy-handed in terms of the uh the dialogue but

30:26.000 --> 30:31.360
you know whatever i guess if alex wants to take that as oh that's right whenever the old guy pulls

30:31.360 --> 30:36.480
him aside and they're standing on the ledge with all the apartments behind him and no one can see

30:36.480 --> 30:41.600
them or whatever yeah yeah it's in the middle of the night the thing i loved about that scene is

30:41.600 --> 30:48.160
like this fucking apartment complex if you want to call it that is gigantic huge that dude the

30:48.160 --> 30:53.680
counselor or whatever had to have been waiting forever on the off chance that neo would walk

30:53.680 --> 30:58.080
out of his little apartment so he could walk up and be like do you need some coke hey you want

30:58.080 --> 31:03.120
to hang out i would have loved for the like a scene of the movie just be like dude he doesn't

31:03.120 --> 31:07.840
even have like a cell phone to like play a game on or something he's just sitting there twiddling

31:07.840 --> 31:14.160
his thumbs he's got he's got the neo futuristic version of angry birds and he's just throwing

31:14.160 --> 31:21.280
plushies off the off the edge shit i hope neo has a bad dream and wakes up he comes out here

31:24.080 --> 31:27.600
just gonna wait gotta make this look like i'm randomly passing by

31:29.920 --> 31:35.360
he's hiding around the corner yeah yeah oh when he opens the door yeah so um you know the big set

31:35.360 --> 31:41.680
piece uh at the end of the movie is uh neo meets with the architect sure who created all the

31:41.680 --> 31:49.280
previous matrix right right and explains to neo that he is a uh like a uh aberration yeah yeah

31:49.280 --> 31:54.400
matrix yeah uh he's supposed to go to the source and then everything will reboot reset all over

31:54.400 --> 32:00.000
again it was built into the code etc etc yeah so alex talks about that a little bit and the

32:00.000 --> 32:09.120
architect this old man sigmund freud obi-wan kenobi archetype no to both sits there and uh

32:10.320 --> 32:17.120
tells neo that they have allowed people to leave the matrix that they discovered

32:17.680 --> 32:21.440
that suppressing an exodus from the matrix

32:21.440 --> 32:35.200
actually causes a shutdown and a degradation of the 99 that remain inside their exoluthal tanks

32:37.040 --> 32:44.000
that's correct as human batteries for the power grid surprised he understood and again you find

32:44.000 --> 32:54.000
out that basically the computers are disembodied spirits are angels are devils and uh have all the

32:54.000 --> 33:05.280
same carnal desires as humans but with an added uh viciousness like greek god so it is an illuminati

33:05.280 --> 33:13.360
film through and they tell you we are the proof god okay i that clip was fascinating to me because

33:13.360 --> 33:18.560
he's kind of getting it but he also doesn't seem to understand that it's a piece of fiction no

33:18.560 --> 33:24.160
and then second he doesn't get that the characters in the matrix that like neo runs into are supposed

33:24.160 --> 33:31.920
to be programmed yeah he doesn't get like the idea that these are their programs in a computer no

33:31.920 --> 33:38.240
no they explicitly say things that are like oh that's what you are yeah you know like uh the

33:38.240 --> 33:44.640
guy who fights neo before he goes to talk to the uh the oracle is like he he's basically like a

33:44.640 --> 33:49.280
password screen yeah yeah whatever to authenticate totally whenever they go through all those doors

33:49.280 --> 33:54.560
like it's the back door in a program like they talk about this pretty explicitly almost constantly

33:54.560 --> 33:59.760
yes to the point where you're like wait and is when is he gonna fight microsoft word yeah they

33:59.760 --> 34:04.800
aren't greek gods yeah or anything yeah he's gonna like clippy yeah exactly what is this gonna show

34:04.800 --> 34:10.080
up agent smith absorbs clippy you're trying to destroy the make matrix would you like some help

34:10.080 --> 34:16.560
with that oh god yeah i don't understand i don't understand how you can like get half of it i guess

34:16.560 --> 34:24.960
and not the the the bigger picture yeah the oracle herself itself is a program and not a person or

34:24.960 --> 34:33.360
an actual oracle at delphi yes yeah so i have now uh my notes from the matrix reloaded they're

34:33.360 --> 34:38.240
getting intense you remember i do appreciate that your handwriting is much larger than mine

34:38.240 --> 34:42.720
um that was just sort of like so i could scribble you know like i see so i could watch it and also

34:42.720 --> 34:48.240
like half ha ha haphazardly take notes gotcha so here i'm just gonna read the notes uh-huh

34:48.240 --> 34:54.480
as they appear on the page michael from lost exclamation point true i forgot that michael

34:54.480 --> 34:58.720
from lost was in this he's one of the main characters he is one of the main characters yes

34:58.720 --> 35:03.280
he's like one of the four people of in abaca and he's great yeah he's really great i love that guy

35:03.280 --> 35:09.360
he's really good in the role too yep i don't want him to get hurt yeah um what oh this is just a

35:09.360 --> 35:14.240
little note one of the fun things about the matrix is how important non-neo characters are that's

35:14.240 --> 35:19.360
true you know what is it is like he's the chosen one and all this but none of it would be possible

35:19.360 --> 35:24.880
like what he's doing if it weren't for other things that like morpheus is doing or niobe is

35:24.880 --> 35:31.840
doing like everyone else has like parts that they need to play in order for him to be able to live

35:31.840 --> 35:37.280
up to his oneness totally or whatever i think that's great it is absolutely no coincidence

35:37.280 --> 35:41.600
either that all of those characters are from a diverse set of backgrounds with a bunch of

35:41.600 --> 35:48.400
different possibilities within that yeah yeah yeah my next note roy jones jr i forgot that

35:48.400 --> 35:54.320
roy jones jr is in this i also forgot that roy jones jr was in that i almost forgot oh man yeah

35:54.320 --> 35:59.440
one of the one of the great albums one of the great uh rap albums uh round one the album uh

35:59.440 --> 36:05.200
roy jones jr weird who want to get knocked out who want to fight roy jones who want to be next

36:05.200 --> 36:12.320
now that i think about it that is weird oh yes oh boy yeah weird yep okay uh there's that scene

36:12.320 --> 36:17.280
where there's two oh this is just a stupid note so there's a scene where there's like agent smith

36:17.280 --> 36:21.440
turns another person into an agent smith yeah each other yeah they made the staring thing i

36:21.440 --> 36:26.800
just wrote two agent smith should kiss totally they had to have at some point right it felt

36:26.800 --> 36:34.560
like they were going they had to have um all right um what would you do if you met you dad

36:34.560 --> 36:38.880
i probably think you'd fall in love i don't think so i'd probably try and beat myself

36:40.240 --> 36:44.960
so i i thought that it was a little bit tacky that the beef between morpheus and the commander

36:44.960 --> 36:50.160
was about niobe was about a woman like i thought that was a little bit uh easy uh yeah especially

36:50.160 --> 36:54.240
when we're dealing with on the other hand there's part of me that thinks it's a good character

36:54.240 --> 36:59.680
choice because despite the fact that we're dealing with such an end of the world level threat of

36:59.680 --> 37:04.720
course people are still going to have those dumb little uh personal beefs you know what i'm saying

37:04.720 --> 37:10.480
i get that it's a little bit convenient and a little simple exactly i fucking love harry lenox

37:11.520 --> 37:17.360
dude who plays the commander he is great he is really really good he is oh what a fucking hard

37:17.360 --> 37:24.640
ass for no reason half the time but also this is my next note he's not wrong to doubt morpheus no

37:24.640 --> 37:29.840
no no agree totally rational morpheus is out of pocket he's doing all kinds of shit he's

37:29.840 --> 37:36.000
ignoring the chain of command yes fully understand yeah um the other the other thing too that i was

37:36.000 --> 37:41.600
thinking about is like you know you you you forget i guess if you haven't seen these movies in a

37:41.600 --> 37:48.640
while you kind of forget that everybody hates neo and and morpheus basically they're not the heroes

37:48.640 --> 37:56.800
to the powers that be in the the human world right of zion like they are not like they are out like

37:56.800 --> 38:01.840
you said they're out of pocket yeah totally and you forget that it's they're they're they're

38:01.840 --> 38:08.240
basically populist leaders alex should love this yeah to a certain to a certain uh interpretation

38:08.240 --> 38:14.800
too you can view that as like it is a positive thing that these people will just completely

38:14.800 --> 38:20.640
ignore orders and completely ignore the the uh current power structure in order to fight what

38:20.640 --> 38:26.160
they believe is is true and correct but also what if they were wrong they've just killed all of

38:26.160 --> 38:34.320
humanity so there's that yeah you know uh next note i love a cave but zion sucks um i do love

38:34.320 --> 38:41.360
a cave uh i just didn't care for the aesthetic of of zion i will tell you about the cave we when i

38:41.360 --> 38:46.320
i watched that movie with uh my best friend and his dad because uh i can't remember how

38:46.320 --> 38:52.880
old we were at the time but it wasn't like cool for us to go because my parents heard

38:52.880 --> 38:58.640
that there was a tit in the dance scene in the cave oh no oh there was a tit my friend really

38:58.640 --> 39:05.040
oh no joke oh could you have spotted it unless somebody told you way in advance there's a lot

39:05.040 --> 39:09.920
of people there's tons of people but that was enough for my family to be like hey there might

39:09.920 --> 39:14.960
be a tit and not being able to see that leads me to my next note and that is this cave is way too

39:14.960 --> 39:22.640
big that was a giant cave everyone's having their their uh their moment the tribal beats and the

39:22.640 --> 39:29.200
rave it's too big the acoustics were great in that cave it's too big it's ridiculously big

39:30.160 --> 39:37.840
uh next note uh fishburn not good i don't think he was carrying his weight i think the first movie

39:37.840 --> 39:43.200
he did so much yeah that in this one he was allowed to just kind of be in the background

39:43.200 --> 39:50.000
yeah you know i was just not uh that i was not that into him um so next note is neo a virgin

39:50.000 --> 39:54.480
look when he and trinity are hooking up sure is that his first time i mean in the real world it

39:54.480 --> 39:59.760
has to be doesn't it i would think so yeah that's interesting what not very but a little bit

39:59.760 --> 40:04.880
interesting what what kind of what kind of dick prowess could you have if you've only done it in

40:04.880 --> 40:10.880
the imaginary world i don't know i mean maybe hey if you come in in the matrix you come in real life

40:10.880 --> 40:16.640
is that true i think so if you die in the matrix then yeah so everybody's goo is gross as shit

40:16.640 --> 40:22.720
next note keanu is not enough of a blank slate like when he was sitting there talking to the

40:22.720 --> 40:29.520
the oracle yeah i was like he's supposed to be like a blank slate that's kind of you know you

40:29.520 --> 40:35.920
have sure he's he has too much agency for the role that he's in i think okay all right i might

40:35.920 --> 40:41.360
be wrong but yeah i think we could i i would need to watch the movie again and then we could really

40:41.360 --> 40:47.360
get into it i got a little bit bored uh there's because it drives a little bit yeah and i i

40:47.360 --> 40:53.360
this note is this movie is just a video game everything is a fetch quest yeah that's a good

40:53.360 --> 41:00.560
point constantly over and over again yeah yeah oh you have to go get the key maker oh the key maker

41:00.560 --> 41:06.160
takes you to a door like you know over and over again like you have to go to a oh and then once

41:06.160 --> 41:11.760
you get there oh no you gotta go to b oh no you gotta go to c it's it's a little bit clunky but

41:11.760 --> 41:18.160
like i said like once they get to the the like highway chase scene things pick up business

41:18.160 --> 41:23.520
business picks up yeah yeah you forget a little bit of like they're just going around doing a

41:23.520 --> 41:27.280
quest right all right you get lost you get absorbed in it a little bit more but at the

41:27.280 --> 41:33.920
beginning it's it was a drag oh uh later on it's borderline a heist film in that way of

41:33.920 --> 41:40.240
like a problem arises we have to go somewhere and get the you know like uh like oceans 11 we got to

41:40.240 --> 41:46.560
go get the uh emp from some other place because ours broke or whatever yeah yeah like that kind

41:46.560 --> 41:54.560
of thing next note hugo weaving is a monster he's killing it he hmm he's good he is good he's good

41:54.560 --> 42:00.160
at acting he's good at uh agent smith i don't know about my uh my boys elrond i have a different

42:00.160 --> 42:04.240
interpretation of the elrond but that's fine that's fine i'm talking about just in this film

42:04.240 --> 42:12.160
he is crushing i get it i get it also i didn't really have as much of a memory of who the bad

42:12.160 --> 42:19.280
guy is like obviously in the first movie the bad guy is the matrix it's the mature sure and i kind

42:19.280 --> 42:23.520
of thought that was true in the second movie too and then agent smith becomes the villain in the

42:23.520 --> 42:30.480
third one i didn't realize that it was really clear early in the second movie and it's agent

42:30.480 --> 42:36.720
oh yeah yeah yeah the matrix and the machines are no longer really like they're an impediment maybe

42:36.720 --> 42:44.640
yeah they're a hassle but the bad guy is clearly agent smith yeah it's a virus yeah yeah um also

42:44.640 --> 42:50.400
this is this is just a little bit of a nitpick thing uh neo stops bullets yes you know yeah

42:50.400 --> 42:58.080
why is he ever punched sometimes you get punched he has telekinesis i don't understand why nobody

42:58.080 --> 43:03.600
threw a bottle of power raid at him that he can also stop with his matrix powers yeah that seems

43:03.600 --> 43:07.600
to make the most sense to me and then while he's stopping the power raid he could scold alex

43:08.640 --> 43:14.560
this will give you power uh i thought the cga fight scenes looked amazing for being made in

43:14.560 --> 43:20.480
2003 totally they hold up they look like sometimes like a little bit of it's a little bit cartoony

43:20.480 --> 43:24.880
you can tell it's digital but like considering that this is 18 years old or yeah yeah it's

43:24.880 --> 43:31.280
amazing there was a point in the agent smith fight where you so clearly see it go from people trying

43:31.280 --> 43:40.000
to actually do a choreography to uh like complete cgi stuff where you're like okay well this might

43:40.000 --> 43:46.640
be uh a little bit on the uncanny valley but but it's not like it wasn't so much that that it took

43:46.640 --> 43:51.120
me out of the experience of watching the fight scene totally no like you get like oh yeah that's

43:51.120 --> 43:56.080
that's digital or whatever but it's not distracting and it's a cool fight scene yeah uh next note

43:56.080 --> 44:08.080
everyone is right all of the humans are right morality is complicated everyone disagrees with

44:08.080 --> 44:11.280
it everyone disagrees and everyone is right

44:15.040 --> 44:21.120
i thought that was a little bit weird i do i like that i like that a lot i like that everybody's

44:21.120 --> 44:26.880
right but everybody is also disagreeing about yeah yeah it's complicated maybe they have across

44:26.880 --> 44:32.960
purposes kind of you know like maybe it's like you have the same goal and the way that you think

44:32.960 --> 44:39.440
we're going to get to that goal is correct right uh but it might be sort of contradictory next note

44:40.160 --> 44:44.560
two exclamation points on this one no you haven't used two exclamation points for three years

44:44.560 --> 44:49.040
correction three oh shit this is unprecedented cornell west

44:51.760 --> 44:56.000
wait cornell west is in there i forgot that he plays one of the members of the tribunal

44:56.000 --> 45:02.000
he does not it's cornell west yes get the fuck out of here i was like that can't be cornell west

45:02.000 --> 45:08.000
it is it's cornell i will be that i feel like i should have remembered yes although probably the

45:08.000 --> 45:13.520
first time i saw it i had no idea who cornell west was why would i know why would i be a 12 year old

45:13.520 --> 45:18.560
that's like a huge cornell west guy yeah it's it's possible that you just had no idea but it's it's

45:18.560 --> 45:24.320
outrageous he's one of the people who's on the board or whatever yeah whenever uh they're talking

45:24.320 --> 45:29.600
about sending two more captains yeah help out with an old guy the old the old guy who talks

45:29.600 --> 45:34.720
yeah and then there's the old lady and then it's cornell west there's a couple other people but

45:34.720 --> 45:39.360
yeah those are the three that have speaking roles bananas yep so this is from the mira

45:39.360 --> 45:45.120
vingian scene okay i forgot that that woman orgasmed from eating the cake that he sent her

45:45.120 --> 45:53.120
that's true that was tacky that was really weird uh because because the only thing that

45:53.120 --> 45:58.960
you can think of while that's going on is somebody right next to her going i'll have what she's

45:58.960 --> 46:04.320
having like that's literally what's happening yeah and the way that the matrix code goes in

46:04.320 --> 46:09.440
between her legs and then there's an explosion i was like this i would i would have taken another

46:09.440 --> 46:16.400
pass at this this is this is totally not in line with the rest of this movie also does the code

46:17.200 --> 46:25.440
in your genitals give you an orgasm it's an explosion right okay all right um so uh

46:25.440 --> 46:32.400
uh the mira vingian's wife monica belucci uh i just thought this was really funny this computer

46:32.400 --> 46:34.000
program really wants to get kissed

46:36.960 --> 46:42.400
i don't know why it does seem like that mm-hmm i i i was watching them go in and out of doors

46:42.960 --> 46:47.120
and it made me think of the adjustment bureau okay i have nothing else to add to that i just

46:47.120 --> 46:51.520
thought of the adjustment bureau all right they wear the hats they do wear the hats i recall um

46:51.520 --> 46:58.320
i i liked the twins i liked the twins the dreadlocked albino twins this is aggressive

46:58.320 --> 47:02.720
i don't know why you're pointing at me because i remember not liking them the first time i saw the

47:02.720 --> 47:07.120
movie oh okay okay i remember thinking it was a little bit uh dumb or whatever but like their

47:07.120 --> 47:13.200
powers are really well defined and well done in the movie yeah they can choose when to have

47:13.200 --> 47:20.000
physical form essentially so they can be in danger from a knife or a gun or whatever like the way

47:20.000 --> 47:25.920
they go in and out of cars yeah yeah it's very fun it's a well imaginative yeah yeah um and that

47:25.920 --> 47:30.400
the only thing i didn't like is that like they apparently die in an explosion they could have

47:30.400 --> 47:38.080
just gone on corporeal at any time yeah um also neo should just have told uh trinity that

47:38.080 --> 47:44.560
he saw her death in the matrix would have really cut down on time it certainly would have been more

47:44.560 --> 47:49.120
i don't know because they have a they have what's presented as a good relationship yes they seem to

47:49.120 --> 47:53.440
really care about each other correct and it does not make sense that he wouldn't trust her with

47:53.440 --> 48:01.040
that kind of information they're in a post uh like apocalyptic hellscape world let's be on the level

48:01.040 --> 48:07.840
with each other yeah yeah yeah honesty is the best policy whenever uh everything is collapsed

48:07.840 --> 48:16.480
three exclamation points again okay steaks so the movie has clear steaks oh okay okay everything is

48:16.480 --> 48:21.760
very clearly like immediately flashback to the joey pants situation oh no no that was the first

48:21.760 --> 48:27.200
movie like wait are there more steak eating scenes no i i i think that the steaks were a lot clearer

48:27.200 --> 48:33.680
than i expected them to be yes yeah it made a lot of sense and then uh the last thing that i i uh

48:33.680 --> 48:40.640
last note was from the architect scene um you know so he says that you can go to the source

48:40.640 --> 48:46.400
and then you choose people to repopulate zion like we've done the last five times sure who was the

48:46.400 --> 48:54.960
last one who did that and created this zion right who was that was that i don't know i know oh oh

48:54.960 --> 49:00.080
okay you're you're telling me i mean was it the exact same neo was it it can't be the same neo

49:00.080 --> 49:04.560
because later on we find out he made a different choice or is it the same neo who's learned from

49:04.560 --> 49:12.960
his previous choices i don't know but it's a turncoat it's it's whoever the last uh one was

49:12.960 --> 49:21.200
is not a good uh character yeah i mean that's that is that kind of like really dangerous choice

49:21.200 --> 49:27.840
of theoretically he could just wind up wiping out the human race and he could just wipe out the

49:27.840 --> 49:33.040
he could just wind up wiping out the human race entirely if that neo and i don't know why we're

49:33.040 --> 49:41.040
using a gender pronoun for this uh could be anybody but uh you know he's the the person

49:41.040 --> 49:46.720
is faced with the choice of like is everybody going to die or am i going to reboot this perhaps

49:46.720 --> 49:52.240
infinitely but if i reboot it at least we got another go right you know so there's that there's

49:52.240 --> 50:01.040
that uh moral quandary there um i hated the architect because uh too freudian no to obi-wan

50:03.920 --> 50:11.760
no i mean you can't replace uh big words for uh actually making sense you know so there's a lot

50:11.760 --> 50:16.880
of that where i'm like you're just using that word because you know people aren't gonna look

50:16.880 --> 50:23.680
up the definition later i feel like it made enough sense yeah to like it's it's serviceable

50:23.680 --> 50:29.440
no contextually you get it but from a fine granular kind of if i'm combing through the

50:29.440 --> 50:34.240
script i'm crossing out five dollar words left and right yeah yeah that might be a good note

50:34.240 --> 50:38.880
but also i did enjoy how like you know the obviously the movie is building towards like a

50:38.880 --> 50:43.840
climax of like something you think is gonna maybe be like action oriented yeah yeah and then neo

50:43.840 --> 50:48.080
walks through the door and it's just an old dude sitting there that is fun yeah it is fun there's

50:48.080 --> 50:54.160
some there's some subversion of tropes there yeah yeah um anyway my review overall not bad okay

50:54.160 --> 51:00.000
all right you know i don't like movies that much but i enjoyed at least half of it like i think

51:00.000 --> 51:07.120
it was really slow starting yeah like when they're in zion and all that it's it was tough to get

51:07.120 --> 51:12.000
through yeah i was like i'm gonna turn this off like 15 minutes in i was like i can't sit here

51:12.000 --> 51:17.360
and watch this but i pushed through and i enjoyed once it got cooking yeah i recall there being a

51:17.360 --> 51:26.160
lot of vitriol towards reloaded and uh and then even more towards uh revolution yeah uh but i

51:26.160 --> 51:31.200
think that also might be because we were coming off the back of uh uh the phantom menace and

51:31.200 --> 51:35.840
attack of the clones at the same time so everybody's just furious at every movie and i

51:35.840 --> 51:41.840
think that the first matrix is almost an impossible challenge to follow up totally like i think that

51:41.840 --> 51:48.800
that was that was something that caught on so huge yeah and and blew minds like i i don't even

51:48.800 --> 51:54.400
know what you would do if you like we were trying to make another one yeah i think they did a fine

51:54.400 --> 52:00.880
job yeah especially with a massive budget that you're expected to show in the film you know like

52:00.880 --> 52:08.480
the original matrix was so well uh written and so tight because of those uh you know budget

52:08.480 --> 52:14.560
challenges at least partially not of course because of them yeah but that that kind of uh

52:14.560 --> 52:21.040
we got to figure out a way to do this that's cheap is a lot of times a really interesting uh and uh

52:21.040 --> 52:26.080
uh font of creativity necessity is the mother of invention there we go i would i could have said it

52:26.080 --> 52:32.400
like other people do uh-huh well i am the architect um so alex gets uh to talking about the

52:32.960 --> 52:37.920
uh how like in 25 years we're all gonna be plugged in that's true we're gonna be plugged

52:37.920 --> 52:43.200
into machines man oh we're counting down it's not just wired magazine silicon weekly and many other

52:43.200 --> 52:53.360
publications including salon today that are warning you of the takeover last year a new army

52:53.360 --> 52:59.280
war college report in 2000 came out and said within 25 years we will all be in a hive mind

52:59.280 --> 53:11.200
that the pentagon will oversee the insertion of the public into a control grid that we will all

53:11.840 --> 53:20.240
be mounted in our homes wired in to a global government mind control computer see that's

53:20.240 --> 53:25.760
kind of fun because alex could take that clip and he could be like look at facebook sure sure you

53:25.760 --> 53:30.240
know like he's like i was right yeah yeah he's not no he's talking about the matrix and talking

53:30.240 --> 53:35.440
about that being real yeah and there's something uh in your in your house that you're plugged into

53:35.440 --> 53:41.280
or whatever like it's not it's not a metaphorical um oh my god social media is gonna take off no

53:41.280 --> 53:47.040
and there were people already at the time going like social media might not be a good idea to have

53:47.040 --> 53:52.480
it take off and they were people who had studied real life technology and real life trends towards

53:52.480 --> 53:58.240
that they weren't like it's gonna be exactly like the matrix dog eyes come on dub dubs the movie's

53:58.240 --> 54:04.160
evil yeah come on that's reality all this is though like this whole movie everything is just

54:04.160 --> 54:12.480
preparing you jordan sure to go into the matrix okay they are preparing you for your journey into

54:12.480 --> 54:18.400
the real matrix now if you're shocked by this i have been warning you long before the matrix came

54:18.400 --> 54:24.720
out this was their plan the elite of course will not be implanted and most of you are going to be

54:24.720 --> 54:30.560
killed after they release mass plagues this is if they get you herded into the larger cities

54:32.320 --> 54:40.960
and yesterday i read from wired news out of the newest darpa document where they say everything

54:40.960 --> 54:46.560
you do will be tracked and traced and you will be plugged in to this system i'm sure you saw all the

54:46.560 --> 54:52.560
you saw all the newscast in the same exact words in the same order uh that wired article in case

54:52.560 --> 54:57.120
you did not listen to our last episode was about a research proposal that darpa had for a program

54:57.120 --> 55:02.640
called life log uh which didn't end up happening and we're not in the matrix we're not so or are

55:02.640 --> 55:10.960
we we wouldn't know uh exhausting yes so um i feel exhausted by those sorts of questions where you're

55:10.960 --> 55:18.480
like well maybe we are what is totally totally great yeah um fun alex finds it painful to watch

55:18.480 --> 55:24.320
movies like the matrix it was painful but he's still gonna buy a copy well of course

55:25.120 --> 55:32.000
this is real truth is stranger than fiction and to have the illuminati shout at me for two hours was

55:32.000 --> 55:46.000
very very painful uh i was nauseated during the first 30 minutes of the film i will have to of

55:46.000 --> 55:50.240
course when it's on dvd get a copy and try to freeze frame it now i'll still give him my money

55:50.240 --> 55:58.560
but you know like i will i just am i i'm just blown away by that statement out of a human

55:58.560 --> 56:03.120
after what he said yeah i mean like he thinks that the illuminati yelled at him for two hours

56:03.120 --> 56:07.440
and part of that was a powerade commercial yeah that he took personally was the powerade

56:07.440 --> 56:11.360
commercial on the original dvd or do you have to get the director's cut i think i played in

56:11.360 --> 56:16.720
theaters you can find it on youtube okay i found it um so anyway this this movie was the most

56:16.720 --> 56:23.600
gripping that's a positive review word right yeah it tends to be it's a gripping instance of mind

56:23.600 --> 56:30.960
control i mean it's hard to keep people entertained for two hours it's difficult uh there were other

56:30.960 --> 56:36.160
subliminals here i'm not sure exactly what the covert subliminals were they're really good then

56:36.160 --> 56:41.840
in the front of the film at higher levels and then saturated in emotional scenes when your

56:41.840 --> 56:48.480
conscious mind is diverted in the primitive combat function mammalian activity structure

56:48.480 --> 56:57.920
so this is what we're facing i recommend that uh you do not see the film i know the

56:57.920 --> 57:04.560
reverse psychology will probably see it though curiosity killed the cat i was i felt like

57:04.560 --> 57:10.960
walking out of the film it was the most gripping but i'm gonna buy it overt mind control i have

57:10.960 --> 57:18.000
ever experienced i don't know if you could do a better commercial for the matrix movie to alex's

57:18.000 --> 57:23.280
audience than that yeah like that is catnip to them they will they're all gonna flock to the

57:23.280 --> 57:32.000
theater to like like oh my god i was able to resist the mind control no it's like one of those

57:32.000 --> 57:36.560
it's like one of those uh marketing strategies where they try and piss off christians because

57:36.560 --> 57:42.080
then they know real people will watch it and be like oh i get it you know this is fun i'm doing

57:42.080 --> 57:49.040
this to make whiny old church ladies angry at me yeah so this next clip just confused me okay

57:49.600 --> 57:56.640
the oldest form of mind control is superstition the witch doctor

57:58.240 --> 58:06.480
knew when the solar or lunar eclipse was coming it's really offensive and he was generally part

58:06.480 --> 58:14.400
of a hereditary guild or kind of your first masonic lodge no and he didn't know why there

58:14.400 --> 58:18.640
was an eclipse but he knew when it was coming and it happened so infrequently that people would

58:18.640 --> 58:23.040
forget about it he could use that knowledge to shock and amaze members of the tribe

58:23.600 --> 58:30.240
and then get special favors the best hut the best women the best food so i guess according to alex

58:30.240 --> 58:39.200
like witch doctors are illuminati i think that's what he's saying man i will tell you this right

58:39.200 --> 58:46.080
now yeah i think the thing that scares him more than the matrix reloaded more than uh oblivion

58:47.120 --> 58:53.920
that's weekend at bernie's too because if you recall i think we all know what happened to uh

58:53.920 --> 59:00.320
bernie in that situation was there an eclipse he was brought back to life and ambulatory by a uh

59:01.040 --> 59:06.480
what we we would have called at the time a witch doctor yeah i i know that i've heard these sorts

59:06.480 --> 59:12.960
of ideas from alex and they they come from like weird colonial era literature totally uh about

59:12.960 --> 59:20.160
the like uh the horrible depictions of yeah uh folks um the i i know that i've heard these

59:20.160 --> 59:27.040
thoughts but i didn't know that his idea of like shamans being part of a guild an ancestral guild

59:27.040 --> 59:32.160
sure i didn't know that part of it which i think is really funny i think that's hilarious to

59:32.160 --> 59:38.160
imagine that he thinks that all of these these shamans or whatever uh yeah they were somehow

59:38.160 --> 59:44.240
linked up back in the day and you know what they got the best huts that's i just that's what the

59:44.240 --> 59:53.440
scam was what a fucking ignorant and racist thing to think without learning anything about it at all

59:53.440 --> 59:59.360
it's interesting to question whether like he got this from some other very misguided source or if

59:59.360 --> 01:00:07.280
he wrote it himself yeah in his head and i'm not sure um so i feel like alex is kind of

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:13.760
as it relates to the matrix he's really caught up in it being a little gay when you see a society

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:22.160
in decline the empire's always use superstition and gladiatorial diversions to divert and distract

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:30.800
them and that's exactly what i saw in the matrix an overall globalist in your face admitting its

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:41.040
revelation of the method illuminati terms uh homosexual orgies and much much more this is

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:47.920
a corrupting film he brings up way more than once that there's like there are things that are

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:53.760
homosexual in nature right that's a real sticking point for him so what he's saying is that the

01:00:53.760 --> 01:01:00.960
elites in the middle of a crumbling empire will do their best to distract you with superstition

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:11.120
and uh gladiatorial type combats a certain sort uh so that is why alex is giving us the christian

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:19.680
point of view of a movie it makes sense yeah fair enough so i thought like man what fun we got a

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:25.680
movie review alex was off base on a lot of stuff he's gonna do for the rest of the show yeah i

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:30.080
feel like there's there's really nowhere else to go after you've dug into the reloading there's

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:35.040
one place to go okay and that's to the phone sure alex takes a call and this guy is uh he's

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:40.160
a disabled person and he wants to know what the globalists are going to do with him oh no oh no

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:48.080
no 50 years old march and uh anyway i i was my left eye was put out with a rock when i was four

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:54.720
so i had to use my right eye uh pretty much all my life and it's getting to where i can hardly read

01:01:54.720 --> 01:02:01.840
and uh but i was in a real bad wreck at uh well i had to go on total disability it messed my neck

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:10.320
and my spine up and uh i had to become totally disabled and i was just wondering what's going

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:15.520
to happen to me when all this stuff comes about they're going to just get away with me they are

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:24.880
they are going to uh put you in the compact city and you will live in a small one-room apartment

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:31.040
with arm swat teams all about you cameras everywhere thumb scan to get your food and

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:35.600
the first time you get sick they're not going to treat you they're going to put you on hospice

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:41.760
strap you down and dehydrate you to death it's terrible ain't it well i don't mean to scare you

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:47.360
scary doesn't mean to scare him what the fuck was that they're gonna dehydrate you that is so

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:55.360
fucking cruel that dude is clearly struggling he's super fucked up yeah he's really just man

01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:02.640
and then alex just without a fucking thought just makes up some bullshit about how this guy's going

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:08.480
to be tortured to death in a small apartment under watch of the swat teams wow they're gonna tie him

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:14.880
down and uh dehydrate him is that what that guy was calling and looking for i don't think it's

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:21.440
maybe i mean he couldn't possibly have been looking for comfort no no maybe maybe he was

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:27.360
looking for something uh to justify his his belief in alex yeah it's like well this is

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:32.480
the horrors that they're going to inflict upon someone like me and their dystopian future yes

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:37.520
then i must fight and this caller actually does you know i guess he does get what he was looking

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:42.400
for he hopes that he can fight to the death uh against these people who would seek to dehydrate

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:50.080
him well i just hope god gives me the guts to uh fight to die as patrick and you're dead well you

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:57.360
say you have a son yo i got two boys one your job is not to move away and take some jobs and make a

01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:03.200
little more money their job is to take care of you right yeah they don't take care of you they're

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:11.360
going to hell what i mean honor thy father and mother of course that is the commandment more

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:18.480
important than all sure uh but also no also no huge no that seemed that seemed a little bit out

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:22.480
of place for what i know of alex like your kids got to take care of you they're going to hell

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:30.080
what a very strange man yeah what a strange man to react like this to a guy who's clearly in pain

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:34.160
yeah and all the time i feel like these are interesting glimpses into things that you know

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:38.160
he would say or support but wouldn't really necessarily come up if it weren't for callers

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:42.720
yeah totally that's why i kind of enjoy that there's a lot more callers uh in the past also

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:48.000
yeah i do like finding out more and more little tiny details of his weird cosmology of like well

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.960
obviously if you don't stay with your parents and take care of them until their death you go to hell

01:04:52.960 --> 01:05:00.080
yeah yeah satan will uh grab you is that why his dad works there must be must be um so another

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:06.160
caller calls in he wants to he's been he's big into relitigating the civil war um here's a couple

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:13.920
points okay over a hundred thousand soldiers from the union army deserted lincoln ended up with a

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:22.560
general who was a drunk i mean the the odds and the north and later on a president lincoln was

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:30.160
like lincoln was a very spiritual man no yeah his wife was in the adult well his wife is a different

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:37.440
story i hear you listen i appreciate the call i gotta go and they uh have it weird that lincoln

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:44.400
shows up on a episode where he hates homosexuality so much so we get uh alex goes to break and he

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:51.120
comes back and he gets another call and uh this guy is just watched a tv show about hitler sure

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:57.840
and uh he wants to make some comparisons to george bush i do like these calls too yeah uh the wording

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:05.360
uh the phrasing that uh hitler used in his speech before the Reichstag after the Reichstag fire to

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:12.720
get uh passage of the enabling act which gave him uh all-encompassing powers did somebody

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:18.080
take that i'd like somebody to send me that please i didn't but i certainly hope somebody does because

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:24.240
you you will love it alex you're gonna love it so this guy's saying that the phrasing that hitler

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:29.840
used yeah and arguing for the enabling act is the same as the phrasing that george bush is using

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:34.480
yeah he didn't tape this he has no idea alex hasn't seen it it's just a conversation of people

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:40.240
you catch that thing on tv yep okay wild whatever i have a theory i have a theory that i've been

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:47.840
working on for a long time which is that part of why we are where we are now is so many people

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:55.040
have been so obsessed with watching documentaries about hitler and the rise of uh the nazis that

01:06:55.680 --> 01:07:02.480
over time it's turned into a sort of admiration for that for a lot of people which is why we see

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:08.320
all of these conversations in comparisons to hitler from the far right about everybody else

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:14.240
despite them adopting those tactics tactics almost whole cloth you know what i'm saying yeah i think

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:21.600
i think they're like it was effective i think you could learn the wrong lessons yes um so alex and

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:27.680
this caller while they're talking about hitler and his speech that is mirroring uh george w bush um

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:34.160
they they get into a little bit of a hey let's recast the bush administration but with their

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:40.080
sort of their analog in the sure sure sure the hitler administration of course of course

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:46.320
the comparison between the bush administration and the hitler administration john ashcroft

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:55.120
homeland security patriot act yeah john ashcroft heinrich heinrich heimler heinrich heinrich

01:07:55.120 --> 01:08:03.520
heimler yeah and we've got um i guess ridge is kind of the herman guring and cheney is um well

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:09.040
i guess kind of a behind the scenes guy but it's it's they're not going to get away with it

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:10.240
it's rumsfeld gabbles

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:20.320
it's rumsfeld gerbils gabble's rub spelled gabbles

01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:27.440
i need to be in more situations where that question is asked of me yeah so john ashcroft

01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:32.240
was the attorney general for bush this is not analogous to himbler who was the reichfuhrer

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:36.960
yeah he was the commander of the ss if you want to be overly generous you could say like he was

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:42.320
metaphorically the head of the joint chiefs maybe something like that maybe he was just colon pal

01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:47.520
tom ridge is the secretary of homeland security right herman gering was the head of the luftwaffe

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:51.280
and then he was in control of the reich tag so an equivalent here might be the speaker of the house

01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:56.080
or maybe vice presidents and so the president of the senate sure sure cheney's behind the scenes

01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:01.280
guy with no parallel so i'm gonna ignore that apparently rumsfeld is gerbils which is fucking

01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:07.840
nuts yeah that's carl rove is gerbils yeah anyone who knows how to book a fantasy nazi team knows

01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:12.160
that it's a disgrace that alex doesn't like no it's rove yeah it's it's could not have been more

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:20.400
rove ever yeah no there's only rove and gerbils like it's those two it's very very simple so

01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:28.960
gabbles um he had some ideas about uh the big lie that is that is so much like how uh how gabbles

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:34.160
he had some ideas about the big lie right you tell a big enough lie and people will believe it

01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:38.800
bigger lie harder it is for people to you know whatever the big lie alex has some thoughts about

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:44.080
that well joseph gabbles was hitler's minister of propaganda he's the one who said when you tell a

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:50.000
lie make it big repeat it often and most of the people will believe it and some people say that

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:55.360
that quote is i don't ever bother what our enemies do is tell a big lie and tell it often enough but

01:09:55.360 --> 01:10:02.640
that they were still explaining what they did i don't know i seem to remember from sarah's book

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:09.360
uh as the way i quoted it but i may well be wrong but uh but what i'm saying is some people say that

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:14.400
that's taken out of context but no they're explaining how the big lie works regardless

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:19.280
it's a statement of fact so some people think that was taken out of context is there anything

01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:24.640
more american than two old white guys talking about nazis that they haven't bothered to read

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:31.200
about so gerbils took the concept of the big lie actually from another source sure from mine comp

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:35.680
yeah hitler's book yep the passage in question had to do with hitler blaming everything that

01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:41.520
went wrong in world war one on the jews the jews had committed a big lie about what had gone down

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:46.160
when alex says that gerbils points out that their enemies use a big lie what he's failing to point

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:51.520
out is that the actual context of the quote is nazi propaganda against jews yeah the big lie

01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:57.520
was the bit was the lie about jews being the problem that was the big lie yeah the big lie

01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:03.360
wasn't the jews lying about their involvement the big lie was telling people that it alex is doing

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:09.120
a great job of putting uh history into context for his this is awesome great hey this is the

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:15.200
guy who said that hitler and stalin were complete badasses he's read so many books about world war

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:22.320
two millions so alex gets another caller and this this is my kind of cat okay he wants to know a

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:29.600
very specific question uh he wants the answer uh from alex and that is what bible do you read man

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:34.240
and this is a loaded question sure because this means something to this caller obviously he thinks

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:40.160
that some uh versions of the bible are not accurate yeah yeah some things like a like a

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:45.360
newer version the king james or the niv or whatever it is you'd like there are some books

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:51.600
that are added yeah yeah yeah maybe he's somebody who's into some non-canonical books maybe who

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:56.960
knows i love this kind of question because it's very specific and there's a specific answer that

01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:04.000
you should give okay if you're a religious person uh-huh you should have an opinion even if that

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:10.560
opinion is i think a lot of different translations sure uh are okay sure you should have an answer

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:17.600
alex whiffs uh let's talk to george in colorado thanks for holding george you're on the air

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:22.240
yeah how you doing man i'm a first-time listener and uh i gotta know where you stand on a couple

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:27.440
of things um on sunday morning when you go to church uh just wondering uh what bible you

01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:34.560
carried to uh church with you well i don't go to church i don't go to the worship the government

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:39.920
and and learn a masonic religion most of these i can't really find a church here locally i

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:48.400
occasionally go to tex mars church which is good oh no no oh no no so okay so alex doesn't go to

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:55.120
churches but when he does he goes to tex mars noted anti-semite yeah yeah yeah i don't necessarily

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:58.400
even believe that i think alex is just grasping at straws and that was the only thing that could

01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:05.200
come into his mind of like oh this is a crazy uh right wing extremist uh church i can you know sort

01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:11.120
of signal to yeah um but yeah i mean the caller is just like he wants an answer of like king james

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:17.840
all the way baby yeah and alex instead is like i only go to uh uh uh insane anti-semite church

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:23.360
yeah yeah i don't go to church where you worship the government it couldn't be more of an important

01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:28.960
question either because the simple fact is if you want to believe the bible you also have to believe

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:34.800
that it was divinely inspired so if there's a difference between two different versions of the

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:40.960
bible that would suggest that people got involved somewhere along the line uh at least in one of the

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:46.400
versions exactly if there's a discrepancy right so uh this caller is into jesus and that should be

01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:54.320
enough for alex it's not it's just on a spiritual level here and uh from my from here in colorado

01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:59.840
it's like the mecca where all these bibles are published and everything and uh and we take a lot

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:04.880
of heat and that's what we stand for at our church and uh you know we just believe in the old-time

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:11.200
religion and uh and serving the lord jesus christ you know and going out personal soul winning and

01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:16.640
you know confrontational soul winning and stuff well i don't do that the cashless society control

01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:21.680
grid of the new world order uh no about uh accepting jesus christ or you know personal

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:26.240
faith i mean so your church doesn't talk about the new world order though well no well yeah i

01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:31.680
mean of course what i mean you know that's in sermons and everything great listen i appreciate

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:38.160
the call good to hearing from you george so apparently alex's prerequisite for a church

01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:44.960
to actually be a church is they have to have his political inclination yes and preach about the

01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:51.680
new world order it's not enough that they are aggressively and confrontationally into saving

01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:58.000
souls for jesus yeah that's weird yeah yep yep that's pretty weird yeah you know if there's

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:04.720
anything i've always thought about religion it's that it should be in politics non-stop yep so

01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:11.680
alex gets another caller and this guy is kind of into hitler i believe troy in new york you're on

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:17.440
the air go ahead yes uh thank you for allowing me to speak and be heard oh no about the big lie

01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:24.480
technique the anti-christ accused uh hitler of inventing and propagating the big lie technique

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:33.600
this accusation is in fact the big lie technique in action well um you know it's not not the devil

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:38.400
who reveals the tricks of the devil it's the anti-devil who reveals the tricks of the devil

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:47.440
oh so i guess he's saying that the jews are the devil so wait so the anti-christ toll said that

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:53.120
hitler no the anti-christ doesn't reveal the anti-christ plans right it's a good thing to

01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:59.360
reveal the anti-christ plans in my comp hitler talked about how the jews were to blame right

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:04.400
for everything in world war one and the big lie was uh like pointing the finger at nationalist

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:10.880
leaders right right and so that is hitler revealing the anti-christ plans which was

01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:16.240
i mean if you look at it just very clearly saying that the jews are yeah that's basically what he's

01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:24.800
saying yes yeah that's why i'm concerned right it's concerning issue yes there is a problem

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:31.680
especially after you know alex has said that he goes to text mars's church yikes like this is

01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:38.080
just this is deeply anti-semitic yeah everything that's going on here yeah i don't i but man you

01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:44.240
could just get away with a lot of shit oh yes oh man and then it gets even worse because uh

01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:50.800
a name gets dropped and alex although he should be denouncing this person will not

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:57.440
because i was hearing that guy forgot his name he's from what was his name is david

01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:02.800
david j smith waukesa hatchee texas yes yeah and he was saying you know it's a new world order and

01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:06.080
there's not much that we can do about it because you know it's in the bible and i was just

01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:11.280
you know uh that's what a lot of people think you know they think well it's in the bible and

01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:17.440
certainly bad things happen bad things are going to happen but we have a job to warn people to

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:23.920
wake folks up and we can do something about that and uh at the same time you know people thought

01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:28.080
that hitler was the anti-christ you can't fight him at the end of the world some of the christians

01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:33.760
thought that they thought scallan was they thought mal was so every thug that comes along

01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:38.320
the churches are being paid off not to speak out and fight it i'm not saying david j smith's doing

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:43.920
that he's a good guy i'm talking about the big establishment 501c3s so david j smith is doing

01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:48.480
the same thing that all of these evil churches are they've been paid off to do it yeah he's saying

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:53.120
there's no use in fighting the new world order or whatever but alex is like no he's cool yeah well

01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:59.840
he's doing it for free um if you don't recall david j smith is the preacher who's super into

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:07.120
british isrealism yeah i i do recall that uh very much a white identity uh proponent and yeah the

01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:12.880
true jews are white people yeah yeah so now we have two examples within like 10 minutes of alex's

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:20.640
show of two very anti-semitic preachers uh that alex is a fan of yeah and won't speak ill of uh

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:29.200
he's a good guy that's bad man yeah that's that's really bad yeah yeah and especially because one of

01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:34.000
the things that we've thought for so long is that he went under the radar with his anti-semitism by

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:41.600
just renaming it globalism that he's just openly anti-semitic here is kind of mind-boggling like

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:47.680
does he hide it later well i think i think that he probably doesn't experience all of this stuff

01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:53.680
as being as anti-semitic that's true that's true well yeah it is it's super anti-semitic so let's

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:58.000
let's take a load off let's get a little bit uh lighter this has been you know some heavy stuff

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:03.840
with these calls a lot of a lot of hatred and uh this is just a good fun it's one of the things

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:09.200
that i think is is one of the treats one of the delights of going back to the past and that is

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:15.520
that there's a running theme that keeps going on through alex's show and that is that people from

01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:22.720
the republic of texas keep calling and wanting to like get alex's take on things sovereign citizen

01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:27.360
stuff yes yeah yeah they expect alex to be on board because he wants to secede and what have you

01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:34.320
but he hates these people uh let's talk to dewayne in texas dewayne you're on the air go ahead

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:44.240
oh alex appreciate your uh time and uh the name is wayne not dewayne but wayne and uh i was just

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:49.840
checking to see if you have gotten my letter and i think you'll recognize it because it had the

01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:56.640
texas flag on the envelope and on the letterhead yeah i've got your letter good i need a fax number

01:19:56.640 --> 01:20:02.400
from you it's not over the air but you can fax my fax well sir i don't know if i can you know i

01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:08.000
barely have time to read these letters i understand let's respond to them i understand what's on your

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:16.320
mind sir i just received a letter from the uh republican national committee wanting my opinions

01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:22.000
i answered their questionnaire and then i'm sending them a three-page letter of my opinion

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:28.880
yes and what are your opinions well my opinions are that the only way we're going to beat this

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:37.680
citizen start small and for texas to start the process for succession and then but to do that

01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:42.080
we can't have 14 fruitcakes pop up and claim themselves presidents of texas

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:50.720
alex is just so mad at these republic of texas people not a big tent

01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:58.320
it's not a big enough tent for 14 presidents oh yes i got your letter that that is the

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:05.440
that is the that's the moment just that deflation of that that i got your letter that familiarity

01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:10.800
of like i know exactly who i'm talking to this is happening this is gonna happen is this the

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:16.400
president of texas calling in i have to i have to let you talk a little bit because i know

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:24.640
so many of my listeners are you and there isn't really all that much uh air between us there's not

01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:30.080
there's not a real substantive difference between what we believe yeah i just hate you i just hate

01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:36.880
you because you won't shut up about it i want to talk about the matrix reloaded yeah for an hour

01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:43.440
yeah and take uh aggressively anti-semitic calls yes and now i have to be like oh the government's

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:50.960
a lie so here's how we wrap up uh alex has taken some calls he has a he has a guest uh who talks

01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:59.760
to for a bit in the third hour um who's someone who ran a um a a union in new mexico and they

01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:07.520
got evicted uh because they had a uh war protest yeah and great yeah great that is something that

01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:12.960
you should probably you know you know point out or whatever alex wouldn't do that in the present day

01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:21.040
no um but also i don't know if i'm really that interested in this because like obviously

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:25.520
personally i agree that they shouldn't have been evicted yeah but i understand that having a

01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:30.720
demonstration could have been a breach of their lease sure so i understand and i don't understand

01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:38.000
why alex would be against the landlord's right to evict someone for having a rally yeah yeah yeah

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:43.520
i don't know it's politically bizarre and i i don't know so they talk for a bit in one way i

01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:49.920
am like you know part of protest is that there are going to be consequences for it you can't protest

01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:56.480
and think that it's not a protest if no one is going to fight back you know that's just uh advice

01:22:56.480 --> 01:23:03.360
much like um much like uh the matrix too need to be stakes yes absolutely and then on the other

01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:10.160
hand fuck you yeah you for evicting them fair enough yeah uh so here's the last clip and we

01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:17.120
posted an article on infowars.com about the mara maraginian bloodline what they talk about matrix

01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:23.680
too i don't suggest it's mind control folks i've seen it it's mind control man i control folks i've

01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:27.600
seen it someone like me is strong enough to stand up to the mind control you might not be don't go

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:35.760
ahead do you know how strong he is he can't he can't be mind control he's going to buy the movie

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:41.680
just so he can test himself against its mind control or dan it's good practice or dan perhaps

01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:45.600
all of the mind control that he was concerned about is not the mind control they were thinking

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:51.440
about maybe they were mind controlling him into buying the dvd yeah he also uh has a fridge full

01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:57.760
of powerade and he doesn't know why exactly yes i'm so mad at powerade he's chugging powerade and

01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:02.800
saying these mind tricks don't work on me the only way to get rid of powerade is to drink it all

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:07.760
that's true that's what's gonna happen i'm gonna drink the whole business dry powerade is a finite

01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:12.880
resource and eventually i'll get to the end of it eventually we're gonna run out of power and i'll

01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:19.520
teach them i'll show them i'll give them all my money yeah so i guess in terms of this the the

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:24.960
you know obviously they needed to get to the point where he actually sees the movie yes that's great

01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:29.120
yeah and in terms of preparation for an episode this included me watching a movie so right you

01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:34.640
know that's a nice little derivation from the norm fun um but yeah we'll be back uh on our

01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:39.440
