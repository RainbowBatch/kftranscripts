1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,960
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys, a knowledge

2
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,960
fight.

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,360
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys, a knowledge

4
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:58,920
fight.

5
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,360
Hey everybody!

6
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,360
Welcome back to Knowledge Fight.

7
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,360
I'm Dan.

8
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,360
I'm Jordan.

9
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,360
We're a couple dudes.

10
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,240
I'd like to sit around, worship at the altar of Selene, and talk a little bit about Alex

11
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,240
Jones.

12
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,240
Oh indeed we are, Dan.

13
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,240
Jordan.

14
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,240
Dan.

15
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,240
Jordan.

16
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,240
I have a quick question for you.

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,240
What's up?

18
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,240
What's your bright spot today?

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,240
Unprecedented, Jordan.

20
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,920
My bright spot is the same thing it was last episode.

21
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,040
The tick.

22
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,040
I finished it.

23
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,040
Oh, you finished it?

24
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,040
The whole thing?

25
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,560
Did you start back in the cartoon again?

26
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,520
No, I watched all of the Amazon original series because I just couldn't stop.

27
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,160
It was just too enjoyable and too fun.

28
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,880
Everybody is just great in it.

29
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,880
All the characters are great.

30
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,960
John Hodgman in the second season.

31
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,960
Fantastic.

32
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,960
Ah, it's just great.

33
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:44,000
Yeah, that was such a fun surprise when Hodgman showed up and you're like, what are you doing

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,200
here, John Hodgman?

35
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,160
And it's John Hodgman, so you're like, well, he's going to be a small role or whatever.

36
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,160
Yeah, exactly.

37
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,960
I know that there's a lot of other things we need to complain about Amazon and Bezos

38
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,960
about.

39
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,960
True.

40
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,960
Obviously.

41
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:04,760
Amazon is going to rank really high in terms of other complaints like, you know, unionization

42
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,760
squashing.

43
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,760
Sure, sure.

44
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,080
There's a lot of problems with Amazon.

45
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,840
It's in the top 50.

46
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,840
Maybe.

47
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,840
Yeah.

48
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,280
Not having a third season of the tick is right up there.

49
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,580
Just barely broke the top 50.

50
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,500
Maybe 48, could be 49.

51
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,480
It's like how Alex complains about the robots at the grocery store.

52
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,040
He's like, and then I have to bag our own groceries.

53
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,040
No, it's not my main complaint.

54
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,280
That's how I feel about the canceling of the tick.

55
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,200
It's the bagging your own groceries of media consumption.

56
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,200
Just a delight.

57
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,200
It makes sense.

58
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,200
Anyway, what about you?

59
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,200
It's fantastic.

60
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,040
I will, I'm going to announce this now.

61
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,200
I'm very excited to make an announcement, Dan, I will be making a return to stand up

62
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,200
post COVID.

63
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,200
Whoa.

64
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,200
That's true.

65
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,480
I was booked for my first stand up gig.

66
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:57,360
You had some offers during the time that COVID was really sort of iffy, you know, like pre-vaccination

67
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
coming around.

68
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,360
Totally.

69
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,360
I didn't want to do it.

70
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,360
Yeah.

71
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,360
I couldn't put people in that situation.

72
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,360
I thought that was a really responsible choice on your part.

73
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,360
Yep.

74
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:12,760
Now it is in October and it was booked by friend of the show, Matt Drufke.

75
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,440
So apparently there are a lot of people with a higher Q rating than to get through before

76
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,680
my booking, but I'm excited to announce that here.

77
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,400
I feel like there was some open questions about whether or not you even were going to

78
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
continue pursuing.

79
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,000
So like I was, that might've led to less people being interested in requesting.

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Totally.

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Totally.

82
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,920
No, I had basically stopped before the pandemic, but now that the pandemic's over, I can't

83
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:42,200
like not see if I want to give it another, you know, maybe give it a shot.

84
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,040
See if you still connect with that kind of expression.

85
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,960
See if I still get the feeling.

86
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,640
It's always fun to do one of the shows, the Drufke books too.

87
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,640
Oh, always.

88
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,400
Although you probably have to go to the burbs then, right?

89
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,280
I will probably have to go to the burbs.

90
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,280
Yeah.

91
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,280
Yep.

92
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,280
Yep.

93
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,280
I'll come with you.

94
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,280
Back where I started.

95
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,400
I'll make this announcement here.

96
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,000
I will be there as well.

97
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Not performing, but I will be there.

98
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
No, no.

99
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That'll be exciting.

100
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yeah.

101
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It'd be nice to see Druffles.

102
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yeah.

103
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,800
It'd be nice to take over the entire show and how it just all wonks and then the rest

104
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,280
of the comics are like, I don't understand what's happening right now.

105
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,640
None of these people know.

106
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,240
Let's not take over anything.

107
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,240
No.

108
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,440
Jordan, today we have a present day episode of the Alex Jones show to discuss.

109
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,440
Oh boy.

110
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,920
I am trying to shoot for something a little bit different.

111
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:39,800
I'm trying to take an analytical perspective of even myself and how I engage with the material

112
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
that we're covering.

113
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
All right.

114
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,680
And I think that one of the main problems that I have with the present day is sometimes

115
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,720
I try to bite off more than I can chew.

116
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,720
Okay.

117
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,440
And by that, I mean covering more than one day at a time.

118
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:55,120
I think that's really hard in the present day because Alex's mood is never the same.

119
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,120
No.

120
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,120
Two days in a row.

121
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,120
Yeah.

122
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,280
If you expect him to cover one piece of news that he was really big on a Monday, he probably

123
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,080
is going to forget about it by Tuesday.

124
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,080
Yeah.

125
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,800
We're all going to be dead on Tuesday, Wednesday, we're winning.

126
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,600
It's just incoherent to the point where it's painful for me to try and make it palatable

127
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,360
to an audience.

128
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,680
And it's frustrating to me to try and talk to you about it.

129
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,680
Right.

130
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,680
Right.

131
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,680
Right.

132
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,680
Well, why is he in a better mood?

133
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,680
I don't know.

134
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,680
No reason.

135
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,680
I don't fucking know.

136
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,680
No reason.

137
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,680
Could be anything.

138
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,680
He took a nap.

139
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,680
He stubbed his toe.

140
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,680
I don't know.

141
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,680
Yeah.

142
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,680
It could be anything.

143
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,680
Yeah.

144
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,680
It's like he used to do a serialized show and now he's doing a monster of the day kind

145
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,680
of feeling, you know?

146
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,680
Yeah.

147
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,680
Everything's a bottle episode and it's fucking weird.

148
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,360
I think that maybe a better approach to it would be to just look at a day at a time.

149
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,360
Right.

150
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,560
And so today we're looking at June 13th, 2021 Blackjack.

151
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,560
Blackjack!

152
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
Oh!

153
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,000
That time I almost didn't say er.

154
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yeah.

155
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So that was nice.

156
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I didn't trust you to do your bit.

157
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,080
And so I sped into the Blackjack because I knew you were trying to lull me into a false

158
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,080
sense of security.

159
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,040
And that shant happened.

160
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,000
There is a meta game currently going on between us.

161
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,200
So Alex is on one on June 13th as the kids say.

162
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,200
Yes.

163
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,200
Okay.

164
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,200
He's on one.

165
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Yes.

166
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
Okay.

167
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
He's wiling out.

168
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
He is on fleek.

169
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,760
I disagree with your use of fleek, but we shall see.

170
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,080
I'm not, I'm still not 100% sure what it means.

171
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,080
That's kind of my issue.

172
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,080
Yeah.

173
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,840
And we'll get down to business on this, but before we do, let's say hello to some new

174
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,840
wonks.

175
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,840
Oh, that's a great idea.

176
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,120
So first Reverend Dr. Robert E.O.

177
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,120
Speedwagon.

178
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,120
Thank you so much.

179
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,120
You are now a policy wonk.

180
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,120
I'm a policy wonk.

181
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
Holy shit.

182
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,360
I just started watching Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.

183
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,920
So there's a character called, uh, uh, uh, Robert E.O. Speedwagon.

184
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,920
Whoa.

185
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,920
Yeah.

186
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,200
So maybe that's a reference to that.

187
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,200
It could be.

188
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,200
All right.

189
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,200
Next, Jim.

190
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,800
No relation to a certain World War II person, Gabbles.

191
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
Thank you so much.

192
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,520
You are now a policy wonk.

193
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,920
I'm a policy wonk.

194
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,920
Thank you.

195
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,920
Thanks, Jim.

196
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,260
Thank you for surviving so long with that name.

197
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,260
Next, Chell.

198
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,260
Thank you so much.

199
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,260
You are now a policy wonk.

200
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,260
I'm a policy wonk.

201
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,260
Thanks, Chell.

202
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,260
Next, Randy C. Thank you so much.

203
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,600
You are now a policy wonk.

204
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
I'm a policy wonk.

205
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,600
Thanks, Randy C.

206
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
Thank you.

207
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,920
Uh, I think I've got a couple of technocrats in the mix.

208
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,720
Uh, first, Mr. and Mrs. Makeshift Hamster.

209
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,720
Thank you so much.

210
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,720
You are now a technocrat.

211
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,360
And Kickfisterscream.

212
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
Thank you so much.

213
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,360
You are now a technocrat.

214
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,360
I'm a policy wonk.

215
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,360
Crikey, mate.

216
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,360
That's fantastic.

217
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,360
Have yourself a brew.

218
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,800
How's your 401k doing, bro?

219
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,800
All right.

220
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,200
We got to go full tilt boogie on this, Watson.

221
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,200
All right.

222
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,200
Let's just get down to business.

223
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,100
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

224
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,040
Why are you pimps so good?

225
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,680
My neck is freakishly large.

226
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,520
I declare info war on you.

227
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,520
Thank y'all.

228
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,520
Yes.

229
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,520
Thank you very much to the all of you.

230
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,520
Mm-hmm.

231
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,520
Mm-hmm.

232
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,100
Now, Jordan, it's time to get deep.

233
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:49,020
Giving someone life is giving someone death.

234
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:54,240
You could say that life is death.

235
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,240
You could.

236
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,440
So, today, I'd like to say, uh, uh-

237
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,600
I never don't silently nod with that.

238
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,760
Just like, yeah, man.

239
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,760
That is deep.

240
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,760
That is deep.

241
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,600
So, uh, today, I'd like to say happy birthday and congratulations on the graduation to Madison

242
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,600
F.

243
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
Okay.

244
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,200
Also, I should say that this happened in May.

245
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,120
Well, congratulations and happy birthday to you.

246
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,960
I may have missed a message.

247
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,960
No.

248
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,960
No.

249
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,960
I think they just sent it now.

250
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,680
I think they just sent it now.

251
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,960
I think they were like, oops, we forgot to give them that birthday shout out.

252
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,960
Mm-hmm.

253
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,960
Let's get on it.

254
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,960
Happy belated birthday.

255
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,960
Right.

256
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,960
And congratulations on the graduation.

257
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,000
And congratulations belated congratulations.

258
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:42,440
If life, if giving life is giving death, is giving graduation just signing up for school?

259
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:48,840
Look, I'm gonna, I'm gonna leave you hanging on that one.

260
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,840
It's fair.

261
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,840
That's fair.

262
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,840
It's just fair.

263
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,840
Yeah.

264
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,000
So, one other thing was, uh, Erica sent a message, uh, and wanted a special drop played

265
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,760
and it's something we haven't heard in a while and I thought, why not?

266
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,280
I think the people are itching for this.

267
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,320
So here, this is going out to you, Erica.

268
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,720
You know, they got baby shark, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep.

269
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:13,960
They got mama shark, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, daddy shark, we'll be right back.

270
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,040
An oldie but a goodie.

271
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,840
Always good to hear some daddy shark.

272
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,840
Absolutely.

273
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,840
Yeah.

274
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,840
So, uh, we're gonna be talking about June 13th, but here is an out of context drop from

275
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,840
today's show.

276
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:29,160
You know, I would never say if I got killed, start a civil war.

277
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,160
Good.

278
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,560
Um, well, one, one, you would already be dead, so you wouldn't have the opportunity to say

279
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,560
that.

280
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,560
No, no, you're saying beforehand.

281
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,560
Oh, okay.

282
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,880
On the off, like my death is a dead man switch for a civil war.

283
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,880
Sure, sure.

284
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,120
I think I wouldn't say that.

285
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,560
I know, but I think that's got some Jane Austen, the meaning is the opposite of the meaning

286
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,560
kind of thing.

287
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,920
I would never say nuke the planet when I die.

288
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,180
Why would you need to say, I would never say that?

289
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,240
The only reason you would need to say that is if you want that to be true.

290
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,240
Yeah.

291
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,360
I feel like almost nobody would say that.

292
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,680
Nobody should say that, except for maybe Mandela.

293
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:12,160
So Alex has got a piece of news here on the 13th, this is Sunday's show.

294
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,120
On the 13th he had gotten some news that this gentleman by the name of Christopher Sein

295
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,120
had passed away.

296
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,120
Sure.

297
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:24,520
He was a reporter, and he was the person who is credited with breaking the story of former

298
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:29,200
President Bill Clinton meeting with Loretta Lynch on the tarmac meeting.

299
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,200
Gotcha.

300
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,200
And of course, that means this was an execution.

301
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,280
Yeah, that sounds right.

302
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,560
What is the next thing to come in a season like this?

303
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,680
What is the next move always, and the move they've been carrying out all over the world?

304
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,440
Well it's this right here.

305
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,040
That's what it is.

306
00:10:49,040 --> 00:11:02,840
45-year-old Christopher Sein, the award-winning, Emmy award-winning TV anchorman and reporter

307
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,840
who just had his book published and is doing great and was super happy.

308
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:14,160
Well he got executed inside of his house yesterday, and his body wasn't even cold.

309
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,160
The blood wasn't even coagulated before they said it was a suicide.

310
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,160
Just like Breitbart.

311
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,880
Hell, they'd say Kennedy was a suicide and whatnot.

312
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,320
You know John F. Kennedy committed suicide, you know that?

313
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,280
Breitbart, no one said that he committed suicide.

314
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,280
That was a heart attack.

315
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,120
Yeah, they said he did a lot of coke.

316
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,120
Yeah.

317
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,480
The situation with this is the reporting on it is that it's being treated as a suspected

318
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,480
suicide.

319
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,480
Suicide, right.

320
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,480
Right, right.

321
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,600
Not that the people are reporting that it definitely is.

322
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,600
Sure.

323
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
There aren't signs of foul play.

324
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
Yeah.

325
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,160
There aren't signs that generally would lead investigators to initially give a, this looks

326
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,160
like a murder.

327
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,520
Yeah, the doors were locked from the inside, like everything.

328
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,680
I don't know all of the specifics because a lot of it I can't really, you know, can't

329
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:01,320
find all the details, but you know, this is the same thing that Alex does all the time.

330
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,560
It's like they're saying that it's suicide in order to make sure that there's a cover-up

331
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:11,820
as opposed to there's reporting that preliminary indications appear to be that this was a case

332
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,820
of suicide.

333
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,840
And you know it's a cover-up because they're reporting that it's not a cover-up.

334
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,840
Right.

335
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,840
See?

336
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,840
Makes sense.

337
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,840
It makes perfect sense.

338
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,840
Yeah, so one of the things to keep a real sharp focus on here is how definitive Alex

339
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,840
is.

340
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,840
He did not...

341
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,840
He's reporting this as an execution in the home.

342
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,840
He really did.

343
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:36,920
It's kind of funny how that just flies over me now, just that a man can go on his show

344
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:42,620
and just be like, that guy was executed with no evidence or thought or anything like that.

345
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,320
And I'm like, well, of course he's just going to claim that.

346
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,900
He's decrying that the media is definitively saying that it's suicide when in fact the

347
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:55,800
articles that I could find about this were saying that it's being handled, the investigation

348
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:01,280
is a presumed suicide until other information comes along.

349
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,400
And Alex is doing the exact same thing.

350
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,400
Just the opposite.

351
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,660
He's doing what he's claiming the media is doing and that is jumping to the conclusion

352
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,280
of not globalist execution for sure.

353
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,920
Well, because they do it.

354
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,920
It's disrespectful.

355
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,920
It's okay for him to do it.

356
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,920
Yeah.

357
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,120
It's almost as if he forgets that there are real people involved in this story.

358
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,120
Almost positive.

359
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,320
He doesn't care.

360
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:28,600
So he also is treating this like a real departure from the way things were, let's say yesterday.

361
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,920
And he said, I'll never commit suicide.

362
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,640
And he said, I'm getting massive death threats.

363
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:38,160
My family, my children is from the Clintons because remember he exposed Loretta Lynch,

364
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,360
the head of the justice department and the FBI, all they have a corrupt meeting on the

365
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,840
tarmac and lying about it on that basically finally brought down the Clintons partially.

366
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,400
Well, they've been waiting for a green light time to go offensive.

367
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,640
I talked about canaries in the coal mine.

368
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,420
His execution is a message to everybody.

369
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,560
And I would expect to see a lot of these killings now.

370
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,680
He was definitely murdered in my view.

371
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:04,080
So this is, this is pretty definite the way he's reporting this, but also there's a number

372
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:08,200
of things that he doesn't ever substantiate in any way on the show, which is to me is

373
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,200
a problem.

374
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,200
The first is he doesn't show or give any evidence of him saying, I will never kill myself.

375
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,440
Yeah, I would need that.

376
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,800
That is just something that he says about every case that he tries to make muddy.

377
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,800
Sure.

378
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,760
And then the other thing is he's taking things completely out of context.

379
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,240
There is an interview that he did on Fox news, this Christopher sign, where he was saying

380
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,480
that when he did this reporting, he was getting threats, but he does not say that they are

381
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,960
from the Clintons.

382
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,960
Yeah.

383
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,520
There's a hundred different explanations for where these threats could have come from.

384
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,520
Sure.

385
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,720
Now, I mean, I guess if you want to jump to a conclusion that like Bill got on the phone,

386
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:52,440
I mean, I guess you could do that the first person I've had killed, I guess if Alex wants

387
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:58,100
to just make that conclusion jump and take the only evidence that he plays or provides

388
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,800
at all is this Fox news interview.

389
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,800
Okay.

390
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,800
Okay.

391
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,560
I mean, I think this is proof that the Clintons were threatening him, I guess he can, but

392
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,800
he can't prove that.

393
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,800
When was the Fox news interview?

394
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,040
It was within the last few years.

395
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,040
Okay.

396
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,040
It wasn't recent.

397
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,040
Okay.

398
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,040
So the interview where he's getting threats is from a few years ago.

399
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,760
But also he's saying that it was when the reporting happened and that was 2016.

400
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,760
Right.

401
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,760
So it's five years ago.

402
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,720
So I'm fairly certain people have let it go.

403
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,240
No, they just let you forget about it.

404
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,160
No, I'm going to go with let it go.

405
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,160
I don't know.

406
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,200
I don't know why Hillary didn't become president.

407
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,160
That's true because she was partially destroyed by this.

408
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,720
Finally partially taken down.

409
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,720
Yes.

410
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,720
Yeah.

411
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,720
So Alex jumps around a little bit.

412
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,840
This is the main story he's going to cover, but he also does just throw a few darts around.

413
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,840
Sure.

414
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,840
Here's one of them.

415
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:51,640
And yeah, now mainline doctors from Italy to Mexico, to the United States are confirming

416
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,000
that people are seriously magnetic in some cases when they've had the shot.

417
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,600
And then we find the literature that it's designed to grow magnetic prions in the body.

418
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,640
So yeah, apparently Alex is on the magnet tip.

419
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,440
Magnetic prions, huh?

420
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,440
In the body.

421
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,440
Uh huh.

422
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,440
From what?

423
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,840
Uh, iron in the blood.

424
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,160
I would really like to know.

425
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,160
Okay.

426
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,160
So they grow them inside the body.

427
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,280
Do they inject you first and then they like, is it like an embryo that grows with inside

428
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,640
you and then you give birth to a magnet baby?

429
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,700
I don't know.

430
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,700
I don't know.

431
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,560
Cause Alex doesn't explain and I don't really care.

432
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,580
I looked at this a little bit.

433
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:33,400
It's just like viral videos of people pretending to get their magnet.

434
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,400
Sure.

435
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,400
I gotcha.

436
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,400
So Alex is on that.

437
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,400
He's into it.

438
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,400
Cool.

439
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,400
I wanted him to talk more about this, but he doesn't.

440
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,400
Yeah.

441
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,400
It's just a throwaway thing.

442
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,400
It's like, yeah, everyone's turned into magnets.

443
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,800
I want a magnet, baby.

444
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,840
I need more information on that.

445
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,520
I was like how small his geography is.

446
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,960
Like this is the biggest world in the world from Italy to Mexico.

447
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,080
The biggest amount of like, okay, man.

448
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,080
Sure.

449
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:03,880
Um, the Clintons, they're killer and this is the beginning of it because they were waiting

450
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:10,000
for the green light or something to go ahead and take out people who know their dirt.

451
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,040
The Clintons I've noticed do this in waves and people that control the Clintons do.

452
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,560
They'll kill a bunch of people, a couple of hundred here, a couple of hundred there, and

453
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,760
then they'll wait a while.

454
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:23,280
But when they start killing, you'll see the type of group it is.

455
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,160
People that know about Arkansas savings and loan, people that know about their corruption

456
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,520
and you know, Africa scams and deals.

457
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,480
But this is, I believe the first salvo and I've been predicting this is coming.

458
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,000
What about Larry Nichols?

459
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
We don't talk about him.

460
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
That's that's past.

461
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,520
Alex doesn't bring up Larry Nichols at all here.

462
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,640
Like he passed away within the last year.

463
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,640
Yeah.

464
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,640
I swear.

465
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,800
I think we're the only people who noticed.

466
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,660
I really, I do kind of feel sad about that.

467
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:55,520
We talked about it when he died, but it is really a bummer that Alex doesn't even bring

468
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,520
up.

469
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:01,920
This is if you're doing Clinton conspiracies, you got to bring up the Larry Nichols.

470
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:07,240
You got to say like, oh, isn't it convenient that now when they start back up their killings,

471
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,120
Larry Nichols is no longer with us.

472
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,120
In waves.

473
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,120
Silenced.

474
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,920
Silenced because he's the Oracle.

475
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,040
Oh man.

476
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,760
Why would they kill in waves?

477
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,840
Doesn't that make less sense?

478
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:24,760
No, you gotta, you gotta kill in a wave and then let the tide go out, let tension ebb

479
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,760
and then come back.

480
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,760
I don't know.

481
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:32,280
I feel like a bunch of connected killings in a short period of time and then a long

482
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:38,820
series of length of quiet time would more suggest that it was a, you know, assassination

483
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,360
instead of like an isolated event.

484
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,360
Hmm.

485
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,680
Well, it's good thing that you're not on their trail.

486
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:50,000
I did watch mine Hunter.

487
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I think I've got it.

488
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Yeah.

489
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,200
So we got another, uh, stray dart here off of the assassination, uh, uh, narrative.

490
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,040
Very bad developments on that front.

491
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:08,760
A federal judge has ruled that employers can order you to take a vaccine, any experimental

492
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:14,800
thing they want to have the job hell, I guess they can mandate you got to inject cyanide

493
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,480
and by free will, you could kill yourself.

494
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,760
And that's really the point they're getting to.

495
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:25,480
So wait, how would you get a job that lawsuit filed by Houston hospital employees who refuse

496
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,760
COVID-19 vaccine, according to Alex's politics, he should not be opposed to employers having

497
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,680
the right to make these sorts of demands of employees, right?

498
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,920
He swings libertarian.

499
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,660
And based on that belief set, he should think that the employer has the right to make whatever

500
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,280
requirements they want.

501
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,520
And the employee should have the right to accept them as a condition of employment or

502
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,360
find a job elsewhere.

503
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,960
If having the vaccine requirement is something that hurts a business's ability to attract

504
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,440
potential employees, the free market will sort that out.

505
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,920
According to libertarian ideology, come on, it should be unfair for everybody else.

506
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,160
Libertarianism is about fairness for me, fuck all those people.

507
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:06,860
So apparently 117 employees out of the 26,000 in the Houston Methodist hospital system refused

508
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,720
to get vaccinated and were suspended from their positions.

509
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,460
So they sued and a judge recently dismissed their case.

510
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:18,040
One of the reasons that their case can't possibly win in court is because they're in Texas.

511
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:22,800
And in that state, they have very weak protections for employees in cases of wrongful termination.

512
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,680
Oh my God.

513
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,400
Oh, has somebody been hoisted upon their own fucking petard?

514
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,020
In the judge's decision, they spell this out quote, Texas law only protects employees from

515
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:38,140
being terminated for refusing to commit an act carrying criminal penalties to the worker.

516
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,800
Based on that standard refusing to get a vaccine can't possibly meet the criteria needed to

517
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:47,920
satisfy that charge, but interestingly, Alex's example of injecting yourself with cyanide

518
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,320
would fit that standard for wrongful termination because that would be a criminal act.

519
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,440
That would be the only example that fits that essentially.

520
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,440
Yeah.

521
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,440
Jesus.

522
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,440
So anyway, this is-

523
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,640
Wow, Texas is just really fucking crazy, huh?

524
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:07,200
Well, I mean, they have sort of these weak protections in place and employers can make

525
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:13,560
these sorts of conditions of employment and Alex is thrilled with that until he's not.

526
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,560
Yeah.

527
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,280
It should be unfair for everybody but me.

528
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,160
This fits my policies until, oh no.

529
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,460
Why is this hurting me?

530
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:25,280
So now back to the main varsity storyline, which is-

531
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,280
Assassination.

532
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:31,200
We'll put on screen for TV viewers, radio listeners, I suggest you go to Infowars.com

533
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,160
and see the forbidden, verboten information.

534
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,160
Verboten?

535
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,480
That is the headline for today's show.

536
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,760
Sunday emergency broadcast, and I'd say we're in quite the emergency, reporter who exposed

537
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:52,600
Clinton control of FBI executed inside his home very, very professionally.

538
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,520
The problem here is that Alex can't prove any of this and it feeds into a very dangerous

539
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:01,280
cycle that we've seen play out over and over again in conspiracy culture.

540
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,760
By Alex reporting this as a definitive execution, it can feel like he's just creating a thriller

541
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,200
plot around a tragic death, but ultimately there's a lot more going on.

542
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,460
Because Alex is so sure that this was a professional execution, he's giving the audience permission

543
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,760
to be just as certain and this leads to problems so they encounter people who don't share

544
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,480
their certainty.

545
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,640
People like victim's family members or government officials or media figures who don't comport

546
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,460
with the conspiracy version of this death are now suspect as being participants or engaged

547
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,920
in the cover up.

548
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:37,000
These people often get hurt or harassed and hurt badly sometimes in these conspiracy campaigns

549
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,560
and Alex doesn't give a shit about them or their wellbeing.

550
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:45,120
There's nothing wrong with holding some skepticism or asking questions about events that happen.

551
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:50,040
The appropriate thing to do then, however, is to explore the questions privately by reading

552
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:54,060
or interviewing people or doing some other kind of investigative technique and trying

553
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,480
to find some actual information.

554
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,180
This is not what Alex does.

555
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,720
He doesn't ask questions.

556
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,280
He makes decisions about how to write other people's stories so they fit the narrative

557
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,160
that he can make a profit off of and it's to the detriment of the people who are involved.

558
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,160
Yeah.

559
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,160
It's just gross.

560
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:15,240
The worst part is just like putting that professional in there.

561
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,240
That's okay.

562
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,700
So we do look into it.

563
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,280
We find out that it's absolutely a suicide.

564
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,280
Right.

565
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,600
Well that's how you know it was a professional because only a professional would make it

566
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,600
so clean.

567
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,600
Yeah.

568
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,600
Exactly.

569
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,600
Yeah, definitely.

570
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,600
So there's just no escape.

571
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,480
No evidence is evidence of the conclusion that Alex has already reached.

572
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,480
Exactly.

573
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,480
Yeah.

574
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,480
You can't, you can't.

575
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,920
And overwhelming evidence is even more evidence that the conspiracy is true.

576
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,160
There has to be just a little bit of evidence in that sweet spot, I guess.

577
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,200
And this is bad because, I mean, obviously I think anyone listening to our show can understand

578
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
why this is bad.

579
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,200
Sure, sure.

580
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,200
But it's bad even more than we've already discussed and that's because Alex is presenting

581
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,920
this as like a real escalation in things from the globalists.

582
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:03,640
They're assassinating reporters in order to cover up their dirty business.

583
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,640
In waves.

584
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,840
And there's going to be a lot more.

585
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,840
Exactly.

586
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,480
And this is a crossing of the Rubicon.

587
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:16,940
To go to that escalation, to start really killing people, passes a whole other Rubicon.

588
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,800
And it's because the globalists are so incredibly desperate.

589
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,040
But if you look at their entire posture and everything they're doing and everything they've

590
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:31,400
been carrying out, I mean, they're willing to kill hundreds of millions of people with

591
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,760
tainted vaccines, scar billions.

592
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,300
They're willing to do anything.

593
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:41,040
I just don't understand how anybody could hear this show and not think he's telling

594
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,040
you to kill people.

595
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,040
Yeah, that's the only...

596
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,880
Like they've gone offensive.

597
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,960
They're assassinating the people who are putting their business in the streets and reporting

598
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,580
the truth, quote unquote, about things.

599
00:24:52,580 --> 00:25:01,160
So I don't understand how he can present like, don't do anything violent.

600
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:06,480
I mean, you literally cannot use the metaphor of crossing the Rubicon because the point

601
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:13,320
of the metaphor of crossing the Rubicon is that once this happens, it cannot be unhappening.

602
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,520
That is the end.

603
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,520
The line.

604
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,520
Yeah.

605
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,660
The language that he's using and the way he's presenting the story is very specifically

606
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:24,720
about like, the game has changed and now the rules of engagement are different.

607
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,720
Right.

608
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,920
And I don't understand how he can pretend that that's not what he's doing.

609
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:34,680
I don't understand how this could be the inciting incident if we're already confirmed that the

610
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:39,200
people who have the vaccine are going to be killed or are already dead or whatever it

611
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,200
is.

612
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:45,040
This seems like a de-escalation of if anything, oh, thank God they're only killing individual

613
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,460
people instead of murdering the entire country.

614
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,960
The stakes are weird.

615
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,960
Yeah.

616
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,960
Yeah.

617
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,360
They're not quite as in order as The Matrix related.

618
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,320
I don't like that the Crossing the Rubicon is a single journalist and not the hundreds

619
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,200
of thousands of people or millions of people who have been vaccinated.

620
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,400
Well, it's the way that Alex needs to tell the story.

621
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,400
That's true.

622
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,400
You know?

623
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,400
That's true.

624
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,400
That's just passive murder.

625
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,400
This is active.

626
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,440
This is when the Cold War goes hot now.

627
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,440
You know?

628
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,440
So this clip is four minutes long and I think it's a ride.

629
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,140
It's a journey.

630
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:22,000
It starts with Alex intro-ing a clip of Sine, Christopher Sine, talking on Fox News.

631
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Sure.

632
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,560
That clip does not get played.

633
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,560
Okay.

634
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,520
So this will be a ride.

635
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,560
Instead Alex rambles about how big of a threat he's under.

636
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,560
Okay.

637
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,560
He makes this about himself.

638
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,560
Well, that's...

639
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,560
Because of course he does.

640
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

641
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,560
That's just par.

642
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,560
That's par for the course.

643
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,960
And then it ends in a way that will take your breath away.

644
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,960
Okay.

645
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,080
Here he is from the grave talking about all the death threats and everybody said, boy,

646
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,600
this guy's got courage because the Clintons really come after you.

647
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,600
Yeah.

648
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,600
Believe me.

649
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:57,480
The Clintons had all these big lawsuits filed against us by DNC party groups.

650
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,360
And a lot of stuff that I agreed to be off record, so I'm not going to say anymore, but

651
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,880
just believe me.

652
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,880
What?

653
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:11,760
I know some other big national talk show host that did take the threats and basically stopped.

654
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,240
And I know some big networks do the same thing and I understand when somebody starts threatening

655
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,240
to kill you and as you fall around, most folks back off from that.

656
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,760
For me, it's not about being macho or a pissing contest.

657
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:29,600
For me, it's just about, I got to do what God says and I feel good when I'm fighting

658
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,680
evil and I feel close to God and I feel strong.

659
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,680
Yeah.

660
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:37,000
I want to pause it right there just to like, I think that is macho in his conception.

661
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,800
I think that is the same endorphin rush or whatever that someone would get from posturing

662
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,600
as a macho person.

663
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,200
It's just put in the context and language of godliness or whatever.

664
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,500
I mean, it's an incredibly fucked up thought to think the only time that I am close to

665
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,280
God is when I am enacting violence.

666
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,280
That's not good.

667
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,280
Nope.

668
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:03,280
And just to even entertain selling out makes me feel alone and weak and pathetic.

669
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,660
So I'm just addicted to fight these people and fighting evil.

670
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:12,000
So if they kill me, it's a great honor to die in the service of humanity and I'm just

671
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,600
a very blessed person.

672
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,440
It's not going to be a failure, folks.

673
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,400
You have to realize that's going to be a real success if they're reckless enough to kill

674
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,400
me.

675
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,400
Instead, they're trying to put me in prison.

676
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:25,520
They got the FBI with a bunch of fake cases they're cooking up and that's fine.

677
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,520
I understand.

678
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,520
You know, they sold out to evil.

679
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,520
They've lost their soul.

680
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,520
Sorry.

681
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,520
That's not me, bro.

682
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:35,120
So any of the options, you know, I'm going to love lawsuits, fine, whatever.

683
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,120
I don't care.

684
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,960
I'm going to keep getting the word out one way or another.

685
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,200
Even after I'm present, well, that sucks, but whatever.

686
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,200
Or kill me.

687
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,060
That's almost the easier route right there.

688
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,840
But here's how it works.

689
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:58,120
I'm not backing down, but I will not have them kill me and then say that I killed myself.

690
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:02,480
So I was thinking how they operate and what they've done to really good men to demonize

691
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,480
them.

692
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,480
And you know what it is?

693
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,720
They come when you're there with your wife and kids.

694
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,240
So I'm just going to be completely honest about this.

695
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,680
I'm a tough guy at certain levels, but I have to really think about everything operates

696
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,000
and the way things really are.

697
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,600
And so I'm going to stay in this fight.

698
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,040
But I do need 24 hour day security for my children and my family.

699
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,000
I'm really I've got it most of the time, but I need to have real security.

700
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,520
I mean, guys on the roof all the time.

701
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,720
And we need to start writing profile stuff on the enemy and doing public reports on that

702
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,060
as well, because, you know, here's the deal.

703
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,240
I'm a canary in the coal mine.

704
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,080
This guy was a big one.

705
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:43,480
Just a reminder, two and a half minutes ago, Alex was introducing a clip of this guy talking

706
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,480
on Fox News.

707
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,480
Yeah.

708
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,480
Yeah.

709
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,480
From the grave.

710
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:52,160
Anyways, before I get to that, I'm going to need to build a moat around my house.

711
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:56,440
I'm going to have to have snipers on the roof, so I'm going to have chain link fences and

712
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,440
razor wire.

713
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,440
I'm going to do the whole thing.

714
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,400
I'm going to need to find more people who used to work for Blackwater.

715
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,280
Because of imaginary enemies.

716
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,280
Right.

717
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:08,680
So if we start seeing more deaths the next few days, the next few weeks.

718
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,240
It's a message to threaten everybody to shut up.

719
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,040
Or there might be 20 deaths by tomorrow.

720
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,040
Ron Paul's dead.

721
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,040
Alex Jones is dead.

722
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,040
Tucker Carlson.

723
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,040
The car bomb goes off.

724
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:22,000
I mean, it's a very good chance they're going to turn their little armies loose on us and

725
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,880
then to demonize good men, they'll kill Tucker Carlson, his wife, probably wait till his

726
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,800
kids are in college or over visiting or something.

727
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,060
And that's how they do it.

728
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,360
So I'm calling Tucker to have a show.

729
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,520
I've been telling Tucker, you need to get extra security.

730
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,040
I'm going to leave it at that.

731
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,700
And I'm going to call everybody I know and I'm calling this out on air right now.

732
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:42,000
We have to go into war mode now, ladies and gentlemen, as these are criminal terrorists

733
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,460
that carried out Oklahoma City.

734
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:46,280
They burned down Waco with all those tanks and killed those little kids.

735
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,720
They like killing people.

736
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,920
They're child molesters.

737
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,920
Hillary's a child molester.

738
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,400
Bill Clinton's a child molester.

739
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,680
Well guess what?

740
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,000
I'm not going to be a soft target for these people.

741
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,140
And I'm not going to let them tie me up while they blow my wife and children's heads off

742
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,140
in front of me.

743
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,140
Sure.

744
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:03,280
So I'm going to tell the listeners right now, and I know you're going to come through on

745
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,280
this.

746
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,040
I don't have the budget for the real security I need.

747
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,040
I'm going to leave it at that.

748
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,040
I've got guns.

749
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,760
We've got people around a lot of the time, but what is happening?

750
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:17,240
I need a serious security detail all the time for my family because again, they won't target

751
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,480
them if they, you know, they want to blame it on me.

752
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,480
I don't know how they operate.

753
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,360
So let them do that.

754
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:28,280
And then of course, if they do start doing that, if they kill me, ladies and gentlemen,

755
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,360
you know what to do.

756
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,160
You know who did it.

757
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:36,640
Join me, George Norrie for contact in the desert worldwide virtual UFO conference.

758
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,760
Gotta be thrilled to have your ad playing right after that, George Norrie.

759
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,120
What the fuck just happened to me?

760
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,960
I told you it was a ride.

761
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,840
What just fucking happened to me?

762
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,840
It was a ride.

763
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:51,560
Is he selling product based on getting people to pay for security for him?

764
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,560
For his family.

765
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,560
Yeah.

766
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,560
Yeah.

767
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,560
Okay.

768
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,560
Okay.

769
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,560
All right.

770
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,160
Basically he's saying that if you don't buy more of his pills, his family will be murdered

771
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,160
in front of him.

772
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,160
Yeah.

773
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,400
It does seem like that is his point.

774
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,400
Wow.

775
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,400
Yeah.

776
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,080
I just thought, I thought it was pretty shocking that it ran into money at the end.

777
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:16,360
I mean, I shouldn't be shocked, but the way that was going, it was so intense and like

778
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:22,080
so off track from where that clip started and what he was ostensibly trying to do, which

779
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,080
was cover this story.

780
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,280
And he started talking about himself like, ah, I don't want him to kill my family.

781
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,280
I need more security.

782
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,800
It just seems like, okay, here's a paranoid spiral.

783
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,800
Yeah.

784
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,800
Yeah.

785
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,800
Whatever.

786
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,800
This doesn't go well.

787
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,800
I get it.

788
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,800
I think that's in the Alex Jones wheelhouse.

789
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:42,160
But then when it turned into like using that paranoid spiral to be like, I need more money

790
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,040
for this security detail.

791
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,200
That's when I was like, oh, this is crap.

792
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,200
That is.

793
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,800
He saw that they were coming up on the commercial.

794
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:55,440
He knew that he was about to go to break and he's like, oh my God, ad, perfect.

795
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,840
I can't afford security.

796
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,040
I need you all to pay for my security.

797
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,040
Brutal.

798
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,040
Absolutely brutal.

799
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,040
Mm hmm.

800
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:07,080
I don't, I, I don't know what world, I don't know what the rest of the world would look

801
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:12,720
like if one day I woke up and the headline was Tucker Carlson dies in car bomb.

802
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,060
Like what is, the IRA is back.

803
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:19,560
Like what do we do with the IRA living in New York?

804
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:25,320
I think if like selected people like Ron and Rand Paul and Alex Jones and Tucker Carlson

805
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:34,380
all died in a short period of time, I think even I, as somebody who believes in this space

806
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:39,260
as being full of misinformation and bullshit, I'd be like, there's a problem.

807
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,260
Well fuck.

808
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,260
There is a problem.

809
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,260
This is an issue.

810
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,260
They're probably still wrong.

811
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,260
Yes.

812
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,260
About everything.

813
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,260
True.

814
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,260
True.

815
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:52,000
But you know, hey, maybe there is some kind of a fringe left wing terrorist group that

816
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,920
we have not been aware of or something.

817
00:33:54,920 --> 00:34:01,040
That would be a shock if we discovered a strange paramount paramilitary leftist organization

818
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,040
right there.

819
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:07,320
I would, I would start having some questions if there was a convenient series of all of

820
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,320
these people.

821
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,840
I would say that is something that needs to be dealt with regardless of political ideology.

822
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,840
Yeah.

823
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,840
Oh, you know what?

824
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:18,440
Even if it was just Tucker Carlson in a car bomb, I'd be like, holy shit.

825
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,440
Something's not right.

826
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,440
Yeah.

827
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,440
Yeah.

828
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,440
Yeah.

829
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,440
Yeah.

830
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,440
Um.

831
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,440
What is happening?

832
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,440
What is happening in this world?

833
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,840
Um, so all of this didn't, I mean, all of this prediction didn't happen.

834
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:35,160
There were not, um, you know, uh, this, this wave didn't, uh, no, that was the 13th.

835
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,160
Right.

836
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,160
Okay.

837
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,820
And we're, we're recording this on the 17th.

838
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,820
That's correct.

839
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,820
Okay.

840
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,920
Tucker is still technically alive from what I understand.

841
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,920
Yeah.

842
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,920
Okay.

843
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,920
So it was Ron Paul.

844
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,920
Oh man.

845
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,240
You just can't kill Ron Paul with a car bomb.

846
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,280
He's too crafty.

847
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,280
He smells it out.

848
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:56,480
So, but, but again, it seems like Larry Nichols would be exactly who Alex would want to throw

849
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,720
into the mix on this and doesn't bring them up at all.

850
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,720
Nope.

851
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,720
They just forgot about him.

852
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,720
Yep.

853
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:08,200
So in this next clip, Alex salutes, uh, the, uh, the shorts, Christopher sign, and then

854
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,120
of course makes it a about himself.

855
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,120
All right.

856
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:18,520
So a real man, somebody's parents and family can be proud of a brave die, but one death.

857
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,360
Oh boy.

858
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,840
The cowards taste of death a thousand times.

859
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,840
Okay.

860
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:28,720
And I'll tell you again, they are bringing us into that wheelhouse.

861
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,720
You see it in history books.

862
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,720
You read about it.

863
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,040
You talk to grandpa, you tell you about it when they were alive.

864
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,040
People go through this.

865
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,280
People start fights and they don't leave you alone.

866
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,760
They attack you and they start killing people.

867
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:44,560
And at a certain point you're just like, well, all right, let me just roll my sleeves up

868
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,560
here.

869
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,800
So I don't know what to say at this point.

870
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,720
Nobody should be offensively violent against these people, but everybody should have their

871
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,560
eyes peeled and be ready because they've used, well, I'll talk about it next hour.

872
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:02,640
I knew this was coming for a long time, folks, but I just, they're going to start the killing

873
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,640
of journalists.

874
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,160
Watch that's next.

875
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:10,180
I don't understand what offensively violent even means anymore on his show.

876
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:13,200
Keep your eyes peeled for people to attack.

877
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,040
You're saying that we're in war mode.

878
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,040
Yeah.

879
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,760
Some of these people like to blow up the Waco branch Davidian course.

880
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,760
Okay.

881
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,040
See is their fault.

882
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,240
Not ours.

883
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,640
I don't understand.

884
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:29,500
I don't understand what these terms even mean and the way he's using them because I have

885
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:33,440
a definition of offensively violent and I don't think it's the same as the way he's

886
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,440
using the term.

887
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,520
No, it definitely does not seem the same.

888
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,520
Yeah.

889
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,040
Silence talks about karma.

890
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,800
Oh, he should not.

891
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,800
What goes around comes around.

892
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,720
He doesn't want to find out.

893
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,560
There's a large bleep in here.

894
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,520
By the way, you don't just face God after you die.

895
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,080
I'm only explaining to people, people call it karma.

896
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:55,560
What goes around comes around, you know, report yourself in my life.

897
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,080
I never even wanted to do bad stuff.

898
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,920
And every time I did bad stuff happened right after, I mean, I got a great life knock on

899
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,360
wood because I really am a pretty good person.

900
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:08,960
And, and I really want, I treat people like I want to be treated and then when I don't

901
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,960
do that, I'm guilty.

902
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,960
Okay.

903
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,960
And I try to make it better.

904
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,880
I run around all these other people, man, they just think that's weak or stupid.

905
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,880
No, what's weak is sh...

906
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,960
And you think you're going to get away with it forever and you're not going to get away

907
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,600
with it.

908
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,720
That caught my attention.

909
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,720
Big old bleep there.

910
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,500
It was a while too.

911
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,880
So here's a, here's what was missing from the broadcast.

912
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,440
I treat people like I want to be treated and then when I don't do that, I'm guilty.

913
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,440
Okay.

914
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,440
And I try to make it better.

915
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,680
I run around all these other people, man, they just think that's weak or stupid.

916
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,260
No, what's weak is shitting all over people.

917
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:48,780
You fucking pieces of shit, new world order.

918
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:52,120
And you think you're going to get away with it forever, you're not going to get away with

919
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,120
it.

920
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,120
Yeah.

921
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,120
Man, he's still bad at swearing.

922
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,120
He is.

923
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,280
He's just really bad at using swears.

924
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,280
Yeah.

925
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,280
But you know what else too?

926
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,440
Like I watched the clip of that in the video and there's a look on his face.

927
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,160
That's like, I did it again.

928
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:10,960
There is like a look of like, I don't think he's that good of a performer to be able to

929
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,200
give that subtle look of like, ugh.

930
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,200
Yeah.

931
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,440
Like he slipped and screamed obscenity again.

932
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

933
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,440
It's weird.

934
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,440
It's weird.

935
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,440
Very childish.

936
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,440
Bums me out.

937
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,440
Bums me out.

938
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,560
I feel like people should learn how to swear.

939
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,560
Yeah.

940
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,760
For someone like myself who has a potty mouth, I accept that.

941
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,760
Telling me to.

942
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,760
I understand that.

943
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,760
Yeah.

944
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,760
It's still, the way Alex swears is a little childish.

945
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,760
It's a little bit.

946
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,760
Yeah.

947
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,760
A little bit dumb.

948
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,160
I'm not saying we should teach children swears, but I am saying as a child, you should learn

949
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,160
them.

950
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,160
Mm-hmm.

951
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,440
So Alex needs to get his family more security.

952
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,920
But he also in the snake slip is talking about them as if they're just like collateral damage.

953
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,560
And by that, I mean, he literally says that they're collateral damage.

954
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,560
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.

955
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,880
And I've already explained this.

956
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:58,640
I've already, I love my family so much that I know there's no future if we don't meet

957
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,640
these globalists.

958
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:04,280
So I've taken out of my mind the opposite of a sociopath, but to where just my, my family,

959
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,120
everything's collateral damage because it's, it's a war.

960
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,760
It's not like I asked for this.

961
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,160
I can't let threats against my family govern me and make me stop what I'm doing.

962
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:17,840
But I will not leave on the chessboard the chance of them having their victory against

963
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:24,700
me to make me a villain where they kill me and my family and then blame me for it.

964
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,800
So I've got to have people, cause I know, I know how to look at all the angles folks

965
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,760
and it all just like a computer, like it's working, working, working, working.

966
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,760
The answer comes out.

967
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,480
I always know what my answer is, right?

968
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,480
And today I was already saying I need more security.

969
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,640
I was already calling my security people and saying, this needs to be done.

970
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:43,520
And then I saw this story on info wars and I went and spent two hours reading all about

971
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,520
the angles of it.

972
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:48,920
It all just went, I've got to have people in my family at all times or anytime I'm with

973
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,920
them.

974
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,600
That really sounds speedy to me.

975
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,600
Yeah.

976
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,960
This is really fucking unacceptable, dangerous shit we're tossing around here.

977
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,960
Yeah.

978
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,320
And the way he's connecting thoughts and the way that it's very scattered.

979
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,320
Yeah.

980
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,320
I'm it's a little worrying.

981
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,320
Yeah.

982
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,660
I assume this is all because of the, the few articles that were like, Alex was coordinating

983
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,800
with Trump for the sixth riot, right?

984
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,800
Maybe.

985
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,400
I mean, he does, he does mention that a little bit and I don't actually, I didn't actually

986
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:22,240
pull any clips of it cause it was disconnected from these other, this other story and like,

987
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,280
he's totally dismissive of it and he's right to be dismissive of it.

988
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,280
Totally.

989
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,720
But it's, I mean, that's the only thing.

990
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,880
These people saying this clip resurfaced, what the fuck?

991
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,880
Yeah.

992
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,360
Trump said we're going to the Capitol on the stage and it's like, yeah, that is, that is

993
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,360
true.

994
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,360
100%.

995
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,360
Yeah.

996
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,360
I don't, I don't think that it's related.

997
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,360
Right.

998
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,480
But he's just going so hard with personal shit.

999
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:51,220
And then the fact that he's like the moment you go from like, we need to protect our family

1000
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:57,560
to like acknowledge that your family's already dead is, is when you've turned people into

1001
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:02,560
a holy army and there's just no, I mean that is in some ways crossing the Rubicon if you

1002
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,560
will.

1003
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,240
When you turn people into a holy army, that's fucked up.

1004
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,200
I don't disagree with you, but I also have heard him say stuff like this in the past.

1005
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,200
Totally.

1006
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,200
Totally.

1007
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,480
When things have gotten like fairly intense for him, he will, he will talk about like,

1008
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,320
I've just had to give my family up to God.

1009
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,360
No, totally, totally.

1010
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,160
I've heard him, I've heard him do it before.

1011
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,680
It just seems like in...

1012
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,680
It's rare.

1013
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,040
And because it's rare, it feels worse.

1014
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:33,760
Yeah, it's, it definitely, well in our current context, it feels portentous more than it

1015
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,400
would have in like the late nineties, you know, you didn't get the sense that everybody

1016
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,080
was kind of itching for a holy war in the late nineties.

1017
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:46,320
You thought they were itching for a battle over fucking Satanism or whatever it is, you

1018
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,320
know?

1019
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,320
Yeah.

1020
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:55,960
So Alex has spent, I'd say all of the show rambling about his own need for security and

1021
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:03,360
how this story about this Christopher sign is really a warning to people like him and

1022
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:08,920
you know, really real narcissistic shit.

1023
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:14,320
One quick thing, one quick thought, one quick thought, aren't snipers on the roof more to

1024
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,280
keep people in than to keep people out?

1025
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,840
I'm not sure, but Alex has many times talked about how he has snipers on the roof of Infowars.

1026
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:24,400
Man, I feel like that's to keep people in.

1027
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,480
I don't know.

1028
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,200
You shoot people in the back if you're sniping on top of a roof.

1029
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,200
You think so?

1030
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,280
That's the way I, that's the way I've always seen it.

1031
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,280
Interesting.

1032
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,960
Um, anyway, Alex has not covered really anything, uh, but he has a lot of news.

1033
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,840
I've got all this incredible news to cover tonight.

1034
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,840
So much.

1035
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,720
I did so much preparation for the show today and I haven't gotten to a lot of that just

1036
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:51,880
because I've been busy on this because they want a message to reporters.

1037
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:59,120
You do not report on Bill Clinton with the attorney general on the tarmac.

1038
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,120
What

1039
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:06,920
You do not report on this thing that will literally never happen again.

1040
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:14,840
And was widely reported in every outlet.

1041
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,840
All right.

1042
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,920
All the New York Times journalists dead, Washington Post dead.

1043
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,920
It seems like he's very desperate to excuse him not doing his job.

1044
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:25,920
Yeah.

1045
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,920
That's what it feels like.

1046
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:27,920
I mean it's hard.

1047
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,920
So I was like, okay, well at least he's getting introspective about it.

1048
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,480
He's got more time on the show.

1049
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:34,800
He can, he can get into these stories that he's failed to cover because he got caught

1050
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,800
up in this.

1051
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,800
Yeah.

1052
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,800
So here's where he goes next.

1053
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,800
Cause there's the deal.

1054
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,000
They are wimps.

1055
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:47,120
So they want domination and conquest and war with us because they, I mean, I'm not against

1056
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,120
nerds.

1057
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:51,600
I don't even get into what you call a nerd because I'm a little guy in the computers

1058
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:57,480
being great person, but there's a certain time wants to be an alpha, but they're not.

1059
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,600
And then they get into being nerdly and that's like their cover to commit their crimes.

1060
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:07,840
And then anybody that they would call in modern parlance, a Chad or someone is the enemy.

1061
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:12,720
And we'll show in modern Chad's while we'll inject you with poison and sit back and watch

1062
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,720
you die.

1063
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:20,080
They're crazy little scientists like Fauci and Gates and all of them are psychos.

1064
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:26,640
I don't, I don't know how I feel about Alex talking about Chad's.

1065
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,840
There's nerds bully me with their brains and I'm supposed to bully them with my bronze.

1066
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,280
I don't like it.

1067
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:38,960
I don't, I don't, I don't know if this is a useful way to spend time on the show.

1068
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:50,840
I mean, saying that some people have inferiority complexes is something that maybe Alex I mean,

1069
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:51,840
what's that?

1070
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,840
Somebody is on the phone?

1071
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:53,840
I think it's the kettle.

1072
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,020
It's for you, Mr. Pot.

1073
00:44:56,020 --> 00:45:00,560
You know what the problem is that like some of these wimps, you know, they'll like pretend

1074
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:04,200
that they're constantly under attack in order to escalate the things that they're talking

1075
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,680
about to make themselves more interesting.

1076
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,680
These dorks.

1077
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,160
And they'll constantly talk about how they're so tough, even though deep down inside they're

1078
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,160
not.

1079
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:16,720
They'd be super into Star Wars, but they'd tell you that they weren't super into Star

1080
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,720
Wars.

1081
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,560
That way you wouldn't think they're a nerd, right?

1082
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:28,400
So Alex has another clip that he wants to play, it's about this guy Frank Figliosi is

1083
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:33,440
a former FBI agent, guy in the FBI.

1084
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:39,560
That does have, that's a name of an FBI agent if I ever heard one.

1085
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:45,320
And so Alex believes that this guy was saying that he wants Congress arrested.

1086
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,360
Not quite.

1087
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,360
Not quite.

1088
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:50,000
But Alex also wants Congress arrested.

1089
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,720
But he wants them to have trials.

1090
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:52,720
Okay.

1091
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,720
That's important.

1092
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,720
That's very nice of him.

1093
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,720
That is important.

1094
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,720
Now they already know the outcome.

1095
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,720
He's making this outrageous statement.

1096
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:01,440
I mean, if I was up here saying without trial, let's arrest members of Congress, I would

1097
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,440
say I should be off the air.

1098
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,680
I don't agree with that.

1099
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,240
I want a trial for everybody.

1100
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:10,840
Now to people like Maxine Waters and Diane Feinstein that have been proven to be on the

1101
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:15,680
Chinese payroll and Mitch McConnell, do they deserve to go to prison for what they've done?

1102
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,680
Yes.

1103
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,320
But I wouldn't want it without a trial because that's something that could happen to my kids

1104
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,320
or to me.

1105
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,320
I'm not stupid.

1106
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,320
That's why we have rules.

1107
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,320
So I'm protected.

1108
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,320
And so are you.

1109
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:27,460
But see these jerks, they always get rid of the chivalry.

1110
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:33,760
They always get rid of the rules, taking one step ahead, not five steps ahead.

1111
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,560
And then they're just in my wheelhouse at that point.

1112
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:42,400
When I say my wheelhouse, people like me, I don't want war.

1113
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,400
I don't want death.

1114
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,320
I don't want any of it, but I'm like a pig in slop once it starts.

1115
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:52,680
And there's a lot of people like me who've been like asleep, dormant.

1116
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:56,880
And I really feel sorry for the establishment because I've looked at every possible exit

1117
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,920
from this and it does not end well for them.

1118
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:05,880
I don't know the difference between this and someone being like, we have cells in every

1119
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:06,880
city.

1120
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:07,880
Yeah, totally.

1121
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:08,880
Totally.

1122
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,760
This is basically how a terrorist makes threats.

1123
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:16,240
This is a YouTube video of a terrorist with a fucking mask on going, we will kill you,

1124
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,240
we're everywhere.

1125
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:21,840
Also, fuck off with your trial bullshit.

1126
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,280
How dare you tell me that you, we want them to have a trial.

1127
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,280
We exist on show trials.

1128
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,280
Yeah, exactly.

1129
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,480
Now, if the outcome was anything other than the one that I've predetermined to be correct,

1130
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,640
then the globalists are covering it up.

1131
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,640
Of course.

1132
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,640
No, no, no.

1133
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:36,640
But the trial is important.

1134
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,640
Yeah.

1135
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:38,640
Yeah.

1136
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,640
Silly.

1137
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,640
Fuck off.

1138
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,960
Also, I love the idea that he's like, Mitch McConnell should go to prison, except when

1139
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,480
he's acting in line with what Trump wants.

1140
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,480
Well, then he's a hero.

1141
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,480
Right.

1142
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,480
Then he's a hero.

1143
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,480
Come on.

1144
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,400
As long as he's doing that, I will support him staying in office and I will defend him,

1145
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,080
but he also deserves to go to prison.

1146
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,440
You know what really shocked me?

1147
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,120
They had a Mitch McConnell story out recently.

1148
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:04,440
They had the gall to ask Mitch McConnell if he would see the Supreme Court justice by

1149
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,440
Biden in 2024.

1150
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,440
Oh yeah, yeah.

1151
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:07,440
I saw that.

1152
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,440
I'm going to ask you a question, Dan.

1153
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:13,080
Now, do you think McConnell said yes?

1154
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:18,400
I'm the wrong person to ask because I did see this story and I thought it was like...

1155
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,080
What a waste of everyone's time.

1156
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,080
This is parody.

1157
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,080
What a waste of everyone's time.

1158
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,080
Outrageous.

1159
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,240
Of course he wasn't going to do that in 2024.

1160
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,720
We've already seen him not do it once.

1161
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:29,720
But it's a matter of principle.

1162
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,080
No, it is not and it never was.

1163
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,940
Duh, you're all stupid if you believed him then.

1164
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:39,920
So Alex plays this clip of Frank Figliozzi and I think his interpretation of it is a

1165
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,320
little bit off.

1166
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,280
This is such a criminal statement.

1167
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,120
Here it is.

1168
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:49,480
Look, Chris Ray testified publicly on the Hill that what happened on January 6 is domestic

1169
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,480
terrorism.

1170
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,520
What have we learned from our experience with international terrorism?

1171
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:59,640
In order to address that problem, arresting local operatives is merely a speed bump, not

1172
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,780
a roadblock.

1173
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:05,500
In order to really tackle terrorism, and this time domestically, you've got to attack and

1174
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:10,480
dismantle the command and control element of a terrorist group.

1175
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,880
And unfortunately, and I know this is painful.

1176
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,600
Take it back to the beginning.

1177
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,640
I know this is painful.

1178
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,760
We've got to attack.

1179
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,440
That means kill and dismantle.

1180
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,600
That means dismember, shut down.

1181
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:30,360
The brain trust that's the Republicans that don't want to turn the guns in or have pedophiles

1182
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:34,980
teach the kids or open the borders and let all you weird lawyers run everything and sell

1183
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:35,980
us out to whoever.

1184
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:37,840
Well, I'm a little scumbag lawyer.

1185
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,040
I wear a fancy suit out on to me.

1186
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,040
I mean, I'll arrest you.

1187
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,040
I'm a lawyer.

1188
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,040
I'm a lawyer.

1189
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,040
I'm a lawyer.

1190
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,760
I mean, it's just crazy.

1191
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,280
I don't know if that's what I would have taken away from this.

1192
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:54,000
Now, I have some problems with what Figliozzi was saying just from a different angle.

1193
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1194
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I don't think that certainly the way that we have carried out a war on terror around

1195
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
the world is a good model for how we would approach domestic terrorism.

1196
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,200
I think that's flawed.

1197
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:10,080
I can't think of anybody I want dealing with domestic terrorism less than everyone who

1198
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,760
has dealt with every type of terrorism currently.

1199
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:16,760
Yeah, I think the proof of concept has not been good.

1200
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:21,960
I think that there's a lot of dangers when you start trying to apply the way that we

1201
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:29,220
have as a country behaved vis-à-vis international terrorism, trying to apply that to domestic

1202
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:30,640
issues of terrorism.

1203
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,800
I think that you run into a lot of issues and I would hope that we choose a different

1204
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,800
way to approach things.

1205
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:39,760
Hey, if there's anything that we know happened, it's that whenever our soldiers trying to

1206
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:44,020
deal with international terrorism went to those places, they viewed everybody as a possible

1207
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:46,840
combatant and that's what I want them to bring back home.

1208
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:51,000
The possibility that everyone you live with is a combatant.

1209
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
It's not good.

1210
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
No.

1211
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,280
And I would argue with Figliozzi on that tack.

1212
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:04,160
And I would also say that there is something to be said for the other point that he's making,

1213
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:09,680
so, you know, disconnected from that point, and that is that rounding up everybody who

1214
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:16,040
got into the capital on the 6th isn't necessarily going to cause the kind of change that you

1215
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,720
would hope to.

1216
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:24,480
Prosecutorially or from a disruption of what caused this, that's not the approach that

1217
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,480
you want to take.

1218
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:32,860
There's a broader spectrum of decisions and things that you would want to do.

1219
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:34,300
I do agree with that.

1220
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:41,840
I just don't agree with his comparison between international terrorism and domestic terrorism.

1221
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,960
And I also agree with you that what lessons have we learned?

1222
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:45,960
Nothing.

1223
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:46,960
Nothing.

1224
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:47,960
Nothing.

1225
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,220
Also, Frank Figliozzi has not been in the FBI since 2012.

1226
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:51,220
There we go.

1227
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:52,220
That's what I wanted to hear.

1228
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:55,480
He does not speak for any organization in any official capacity.

1229
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,660
He's a pundit.

1230
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:58,320
That is what I was looking for.

1231
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,320
Yeah.

1232
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:02,640
So I just, I think that Alex's interpretation of this is silly.

1233
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:06,360
It's just the same thing that this hypersensitivity that you see in the right.

1234
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:09,680
You know, like when Biden says that the main terror threat in the United States comes in

1235
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:13,360
the form of white supremacist groups, and then Alex and all of his friends report that

1236
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:16,360
Biden said that white people are the biggest threat in the country.

1237
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,960
It's just the same game being played here.

1238
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:19,960
And I don't know.

1239
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:24,640
I mean, they're right to act like that, obviously, if there's anything that we've learned from

1240
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:29,360
the way that the right has behaved whenever there's even the slightest threat to their

1241
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:33,520
ability to act with impunity, it's to go apeshit.

1242
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:37,600
And clearly that's the best strategy because nobody's been able to do anything about it.

1243
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,600
Yeah.

1244
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,600
It is.

1245
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,600
It does gum up the works.

1246
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,600
It really does.

1247
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:42,600
Yep.

1248
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,720
So Alex, like you said, he has a lot of big news to cover.

1249
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:45,720
A lot of big stuff.

1250
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:46,720
Sure.

1251
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,720
Sure.

1252
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:48,720
He's got this clip of Frank Figliozzi.

1253
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:49,720
Yeah.

1254
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:50,720
Whatever.

1255
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:51,720
The Figs?

1256
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:52,720
Here's the next thing he gets to.

1257
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,360
You think he gets called Frankie Figs?

1258
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,360
Probably.

1259
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,360
A hundred percent.

1260
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:57,360
Has to be.

1261
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,360
Has to be, right?

1262
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:03,160
Here's the next thing Alex has, and this is just, I have no idea.

1263
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:05,600
I have no idea why this ranks.

1264
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:09,440
He plays a video of someone coming out as a trans man.

1265
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,440
Oh boy.

1266
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,280
And people clap.

1267
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,280
Yeah.

1268
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,880
And I don't know why he's mad about this.

1269
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,480
So they create all these people that never worked today in their life, never had a job,

1270
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:25,800
and brainwashed by leftist behavior and manipulation.

1271
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:31,360
And then all they can do is just squeal and squawk and scream because this person has

1272
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,040
declared themselves something else.

1273
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,620
It's the celebration of transhumanism.

1274
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:39,480
And then there's the weird social worker in the pink dress, like approvingly looking on

1275
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,880
at what they've done to people.

1276
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,040
It just goes on and on.

1277
00:53:43,040 --> 00:54:06,320
Here it is.

1278
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:21,200
So these are the lost, helpless people that the system is now in total control of.

1279
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:27,640
I don't understand what Alex is going off of, other than there's a person speaking to

1280
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:34,000
a group who support them and affirm and validate them.

1281
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I don't get how he can take this and be like, aha, this person has been tricked into doing

1282
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,680
this, or whatever.

1283
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:49,180
The only way he can do that is by complete invalidation of the existence of trans people.

1284
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:54,920
That's really the only way you arrive at that conclusion, is that everybody is being tricked.

1285
00:54:54,920 --> 00:55:01,120
Yeah, no, I was kind of blown away by, you know, like I stay away from that world so

1286
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:10,960
much, but my family has told me about some super Christian literature written by pastors

1287
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:16,160
and shit that are like, here's why people think they're boys or girls.

1288
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,880
Not like this is even possible.

1289
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:25,760
Just blanket rejection of the possibility and pure society has failed us.

1290
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:30,360
So I mean, I had no idea really how deep that belief was.

1291
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:35,200
I thought they at least were like, oh, they're humans, you know, like it's, it's just mind

1292
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,200
boggling.

1293
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,200
Yeah.

1294
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:41,240
So these are the sorts of things that Alex is taking his time with, um, and man, he gets

1295
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:45,160
to the end of the, gets towards the end of the show and he realizes, I haven't done my

1296
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,160
job.

1297
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:51,760
The great Owen Schroyer is coming in to host two hours of live radio slash TV, and I'm

1298
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:56,560
going to go ahead and cohost with him because I got, I don't want to stay emotional, but

1299
00:55:56,560 --> 00:56:02,960
a little preacher in the first hour, it's been most of the time that exposed the whole

1300
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:07,480
FBI being under the control of the deep state, get his head bought off of his house.

1301
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,480
Yeah.

1302
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:09,480
Yeah.

1303
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:14,280
I kind of wasted the first hour of the show, so I'm going to do the actual job on another

1304
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,280
show.

1305
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,760
Maybe, but I probably won't.

1306
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:17,760
Doubtful.

1307
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:18,760
Yeah.

1308
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:23,800
I'm going to, I'm going to be there while Owen does the work that I am supposed to do

1309
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:27,480
and interrupt him and keep him from doing that very same way.

1310
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:28,480
And I'm going to be sauced.

1311
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:33,280
I'm going to be drunk and I'm going to be eating a sandwich the whole time.

1312
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,040
I have, I have very little respect for this.

1313
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:39,440
Um, I, I understand that Alex is like, who cares?

1314
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,680
I'm, you know, the info wars is still on air.

1315
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:42,680
I can just do it then.

1316
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,160
Like, no, this is your show.

1317
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,160
Yeah.

1318
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,560
This is your two hour block.

1319
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:50,040
You can't just co-opt someone else's show and be like, Oh, that's where we're going

1320
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,240
to do the real stuff.

1321
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:55,840
I'm just going to fill time yelling about bullshit here and trying to get you to pay

1322
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:59,360
for my family's Blackwater guards.

1323
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,080
It's a, it's outrageous.

1324
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,080
It is.

1325
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,160
It's just dumb.

1326
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,160
It is very out.

1327
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:09,580
I would like to get mad at him when he's doing his job instead of get mad at him when it

1328
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:11,960
seems like he's on his own time.

1329
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:12,960
Yeah.

1330
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:13,960
Yeah.

1331
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:18,720
I, I do prefer, um, it feeling like we're actually responding to something.

1332
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:19,720
Professionalism.

1333
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:20,720
Yeah.

1334
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,160
We deserve a mutual professionalism.

1335
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,740
It would be nice.

1336
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:29,720
So Alex, uh, has some, uh, racist opinions to get to here at the end of the show.

1337
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:31,080
Can't close without it.

1338
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,080
Nope.

1339
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,200
So I don't even know how to set this up.

1340
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,460
It's just outrageous.

1341
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:41,740
It's just, I, I, within the very group killing black people and dumbing them down and shipping

1342
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:47,160
drugs in their neighborhoods and giving them gangster rap on record to call each other

1343
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:54,240
so they can then be put in prison tells you all day how much they love black people and

1344
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:58,200
how they're just so sweet and you drive down the road, almost all the billboards are black

1345
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:02,560
people for every corporation and all the big TV ads are black people.

1346
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:08,640
The globalist corporations are putting a black face on everything they do because they go

1347
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:12,840
all black people are victims and you got to be nice to them and then the corporations

1348
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,960
then you got to be black people.

1349
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,240
It's very simple camouflage.

1350
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:20,440
Can't have people saying you got to be black people.

1351
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:25,440
You are going to then sit there and carry out your operations and say black people are

1352
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,080
doing this and a subconscious level.

1353
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:32,360
If you hate the government, you hate the corporations, you hate the UN, you hate the chai comms,

1354
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:34,920
you hate all this and then it's got a black face.

1355
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:35,920
What do you do?

1356
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:36,920
Oh God.

1357
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:37,920
Holy shit.

1358
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:42,440
Racism as always is everybody else's fault.

1359
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:49,080
I was blown away by this sort of articulation of how Alex sees the world.

1360
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,080
Yeah.

1361
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,080
Wow.

1362
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,480
BLM gave us NWA 40 years ago.

1363
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:58,760
I would guess that Alex is using some sort of selection bias about all the billboards

1364
00:58:58,760 --> 00:58:59,760
are black people.

1365
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:00,760
Maybe.

1366
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:01,760
Could be.

1367
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:05,600
Maybe he's getting mad because he sees some black people there and doesn't notice all

1368
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:06,600
of the white people.

1369
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:10,560
All the billboards used to be white people and now there are some with black people on

1370
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:15,360
it and because that's different to me, I notice it, so now I assume that it has gone 100%

1371
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:16,360
the opposite direction.

1372
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:20,720
Yeah, I'm going to ignore all of the instances of the things that don't make me mad because

1373
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:23,160
seeing black people in ads makes me mad.

1374
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,520
I am a child.

1375
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,600
I am a child.

1376
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:31,080
I think like a child and I have no higher thinking skills whatsoever.

1377
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:32,080
Yeah.

1378
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:35,400
And this is a bit much.

1379
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:40,840
So again, why does racism happen, Dan?

1380
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:45,000
It's because the government and corporations put a black face on things.

1381
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:51,080
It has nothing to do with, I don't know, several hundred years or fucking, let's be honest,

1382
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:54,040
several thousand years of massive racism.

1383
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,940
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

1384
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:59,400
It's because the corporations and the government now.

1385
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,400
That's why white people are so racist.

1386
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,400
It's commercials.

1387
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,720
Everybody knows it.

1388
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:04,720
Everybody knows it.

1389
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:05,720
It's commercials.

1390
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:06,980
It's commercials.

1391
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:12,600
It's because one time I saw a black person eat McDonald's with a smile on TV and now

1392
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:13,600
I'm racist.

1393
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:19,800
I got to tell you, I'm not loving it.

1394
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:26,920
So this is a bit of a lead in to a story about this recent shooting in Austin.

1395
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:33,180
There was, I believe, a concert and there was a shooting there and Alex has some stuff

1396
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:37,040
to say about it and it's a mess.

1397
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:41,400
We love God or we love Satan or are we a dumb ass that says neither one exists?

1398
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,400
That's the three choices.

1399
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:46,000
You're for Satan, you're for God, or you're a dumb ass and of course Satanists are dumb

1400
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,600
asses too, but not as dumb as those that say there is no God.

1401
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:54,240
So here's a great example of this.

1402
01:00:54,240 --> 01:01:02,560
Most shootings in America that you hear about that are still pretty rare are gang related.

1403
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:05,580
So it's Hispanic on Hispanic.

1404
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:10,200
It's black on black and when it is a gang of whites, sometimes motorcycle gangs, it's

1405
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,200
white on white.

1406
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:16,800
Look at the Hell's Angels and the group they were fighting out in California and all over

1407
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:20,640
the country, the Mongols.

1408
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,260
So that's how it works.

1409
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:26,740
So when I hear about nightclub shot up in Miami, no one would say what it was about.

1410
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:27,740
So I looked it up.

1411
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:33,760
It was a black nightclub and I go, hmm, I bet black people went and shot that up.

1412
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,400
Sure enough, it was two rival gangs.

1413
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,120
It's not about what color they were.

1414
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:40,000
It's the reality of it.

1415
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,820
If I hear some right wing square dance going on in the middle of Alabama, I had a shooting

1416
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:45,820
at it.

1417
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:47,920
I'll go, well, that must be some white gangs killing each other.

1418
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,080
And of course it happens every once in a while, it is.

1419
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:54,360
So here's what I'm getting at ladies and gentlemen.

1420
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:59,800
This story is so huge because it's not about protecting black people.

1421
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:04,440
It's about the media, the controlled corporate media, being able to set the precedent that

1422
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:09,640
whenever they want, they can hide a fact because I can tell you right here in Austin, it started

1423
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:10,640
with R.J.

1424
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,000
Savada, who's a big Democrat.

1425
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,880
It's gotten way worse now.

1426
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:17,200
There'll be a serious out because I lived down there when I was in a divorce.

1427
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,580
I couldn't get a house, had a rental place.

1428
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:23,160
And I mean, there were shootings and killings down there in the most elite part of downtown

1429
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,480
Second Street, all that area.

1430
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:30,080
And you'd hear, oh, what happened in East Austin over on Chacon and 12th?

1431
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,200
No, it didn't.

1432
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:35,020
It happened on second in Colorado because I saw it.

1433
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:37,240
I heard the gunshots.

1434
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:39,320
So that's why this is so dangerous.

1435
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:43,360
So you've got a hip hop concert going on.

1436
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:44,600
Who do you think is going to be at that?

1437
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:47,320
A lot of people, but a lot of black folks wild.

1438
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:53,720
And here's the news mass shooting in Austin, Texas leaves 13 wounded.

1439
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:58,520
Now can you imagine if it would have been a white person that shot into a crowd of mixed

1440
01:02:58,520 --> 01:02:59,520
people?

1441
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:00,520
Yes, I can.

1442
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:02,360
It didn't matter why he did it.

1443
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:03,600
They'd say it was white supremacist.

1444
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,600
Well, yeah.

1445
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:08,200
I mean, it's like I guess what he's saying there at the end is like if circumstances

1446
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,280
were different, people would cover it differently.

1447
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,440
Yeah, sure.

1448
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,440
Yeah.

1449
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:13,440
OK.

1450
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:14,660
Sub argument.

1451
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:16,840
White supremacists never kill anybody.

1452
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:17,840
Wow.

1453
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:18,840
That's Alex's.

1454
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:19,840
Yeah.

1455
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:22,320
That's Alex's main argument that he is burying.

1456
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,320
Man.

1457
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:24,320
Yeah.

1458
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:25,880
This is weird.

1459
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:26,880
This is weird.

1460
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:32,440
I don't know how Alex has evidence of crimes that were committed being placed elsewhere

1461
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:33,440
in the city.

1462
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:34,440
Yeah.

1463
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:35,440
I don't know.

1464
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:42,040
I love to imagine Alex just in like, you know, a duster, like a hat, like an old timey detective

1465
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:48,880
from a noir going out there on second in Colorado, like, oh no, they're going to say this was

1466
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:49,880
in East Austin.

1467
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:52,800
I know it.

1468
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:57,760
There's a guy wearing a press badge in his hat, just walking around, sir, did you see

1469
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:58,760
this?

1470
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:03,620
The only thing Alex has in common with like those sort of noir detectives is a penchant

1471
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:04,620
for booze.

1472
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:07,240
That's the only thing he has in common.

1473
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:08,240
Yeah.

1474
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,240
Yeah.

1475
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:10,240
Yeah.

1476
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:15,200
I think that this is also a bit scattered in terms of thinking.

1477
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:18,020
There's a lot of stuff going all over the place.

1478
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:21,560
When he was in an apartment, he knew that crimes happened in different places than they

1479
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:22,920
said they were.

1480
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:25,240
Also all of these various shootings.

1481
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:26,240
Yeah.

1482
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:32,000
So what's going on here is that he believes that the media is trying to cover up the notion

1483
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,760
that the shooter in this Austin case was a black person.

1484
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:36,760
Yeah.

1485
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:38,360
And so he's going to talk about this here.

1486
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:43,260
And I disagree with his point entirely.

1487
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:45,240
Only Fox carried that press conference.

1488
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:54,360
Every other channel didn't, but the Austin American Statesman went one further.

1489
01:04:54,360 --> 01:05:00,160
They said, editors note, police have only released a vague description of the suspect

1490
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:02,920
shooter as of Saturday morning.

1491
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:06,480
The Austin American Statesman is not included in the description as it is too vague.

1492
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:07,480
They still have, by the way.

1493
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:11,160
At this time to be useful and identifying the shooter and such publication could be

1494
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:14,240
harmful in perpetrating stereotypes.

1495
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:17,800
If more detailed information is released, we will update the reporting.

1496
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:18,800
They still have it.

1497
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,440
Last time I checked an hour ago.

1498
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:21,620
So why is that so important?

1499
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:25,440
Why is that so over the top?

1500
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:31,640
Because what color somebody is, what they're wearing, what they're driving, what they're

1501
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:36,480
dressed like is evidentiary to stop them and find them.

1502
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:40,800
So this editor's note that Alex is reading from the Statesman, I found it.

1503
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:44,060
And it's in the article about the shooter's arrest.

1504
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:46,920
At the point of the article's publication, the vague description of the shooter is no

1505
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:51,560
longer really that important for the public safety angle that Alex is talking about.

1506
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:55,840
And the newspaper does not have identifying information released to them because the suspect

1507
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,560
is a juvenile.

1508
01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:02,100
There's just really simple explanations for, you know, all this stuff that Alex is claiming

1509
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:07,340
is so confusing and it comes from the very source material that Alex is going off of.

1510
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:11,120
But it's more important to try and stoke white fear and victimhood and aggrievement.

1511
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:19,200
Yeah, I was going to say, it's very, I don't know if I've ever heard a white dude describe

1512
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:24,680
why what he's doing is not racist without being incredibly racist about it.

1513
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:28,040
That is a phenomenon that Alex falls victim to quite a bit.

1514
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:29,040
Yeah.

1515
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:33,280
And it seems like if you were, you know, like the best a white person can probably do is

1516
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:37,120
be like, hey, listen, I was raised racist in a racist ass country.

1517
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:38,120
I got blind spots.

1518
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:39,480
I'm doing my best.

1519
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:43,440
Please tell me when I'm being racist because I'm sure I will be.

1520
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:44,440
It's my bad.

1521
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:45,440
I'll learn.

1522
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:46,440
Not Alex.

1523
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:47,440
No.

1524
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:48,440
No, no, no, no, no.

1525
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:50,560
It's a slightly different approach to it.

1526
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:51,560
Yeah.

1527
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:52,560
Yeah.

1528
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:53,560
So I don't, I don't know.

1529
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:59,360
I feel like this, this whole display at the end of the show is a real gross and made me

1530
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:02,420
think, Hey, why didn't you get to the news?

1531
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:03,420
That's a good question.

1532
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:05,480
Or was that the big story or what?

1533
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:06,560
So at the end of the show, right?

1534
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:09,160
As he's going out to throwing it to Owen.

1535
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:10,160
Sure.

1536
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,160
Sure.

1537
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:13,480
He's gets to one of the big headlines that he didn't get to.

1538
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:14,480
Oh no.

1539
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:15,760
This is huge news.

1540
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:23,080
If true, which I don't think it is coming up next hour, didn't hit this yet.

1541
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:28,760
The Department of Defense department admits major defector has been there for over a year,

1542
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:35,280
provide evidence that Chinese military orchestrated the creation of the COVID-19 and release the

1543
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:36,280
bio weapon.

1544
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:42,640
And of course that is so huge that you're not wanting to know this.

1545
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,120
You don't want people to know it.

1546
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:46,580
How is that possible?

1547
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:50,680
That is theoretically confirmation of everything he's ever said.

1548
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:53,320
It's theoretically the biggest news ever.

1549
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,320
Biggest news.

1550
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:58,280
That is essentially saying that China is an act of war.

1551
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:00,920
It's the biggest possible news.

1552
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:06,560
The Chinese military released a bio weapon that has killed millions of people.

1553
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:07,560
Yeah.

1554
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:08,560
Okay.

1555
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:12,560
You had two hours on air and haven't got to this story yet.

1556
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:13,800
That's about everybody else, Dan.

1557
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,800
I needed to talk about me.

1558
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:16,800
That's such a bullshit.

1559
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:20,160
I needed to talk about me for the first two hours.

1560
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:21,160
So just the worst.

1561
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:23,760
What an asshole.

1562
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:26,040
That is fucking horrific.

1563
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:27,040
Yep.

1564
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:30,480
So that's how he ends his show on Sunday and I think it's fitting.

1565
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:36,360
I think it all does mesh with who he is as a broadcaster.

1566
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,360
Yeah.

1567
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:38,360
You know?

1568
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:39,360
It's about himself.

1569
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:40,360
Totally.

1570
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:41,360
It's intense.

1571
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:43,280
It's trying to incite people towards violence.

1572
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:44,280
100%.

1573
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:45,280
It's transphobic.

1574
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:46,280
It's racist.

1575
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:47,280
It's stupid.

1576
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:48,280
Yeah.

1577
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:50,260
Yeah, it's a real murderer's row.

1578
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:56,200
And it's constantly self-critical of, I haven't got to the stuff that I'm supposed to do.

1579
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:58,440
Haven't done any of this.

1580
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:00,520
And pretends that it's about to.

1581
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:01,880
It never does.

1582
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:02,880
No.

1583
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:03,880
It's amazing.

1584
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:09,720
It is like a perpetual child who has not done the book report.

1585
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:17,000
It is a show that is entirely around, what if you just gave that kid three hours to try

1586
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:21,400
and distract himself away from revealing he didn't do the work.

1587
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:25,440
Yeah, it's almost a really interesting bluffing improv exercise.

1588
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:26,440
It is!

1589
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:28,880
In a way, it kind of is.

1590
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:35,120
If it wasn't so destructive and dangerous, it might be the greatest 27 year long herald.

1591
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,800
Really?

1592
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:39,080
It's just a non-stop barrage.

1593
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:42,600
I mean, Alex does sing sometimes, it could be a herald.

1594
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:43,600
Bananas.

1595
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,280
Anyway, Jordan, we'll be back.

1596
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:47,280
Indeed we will.

1597
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:48,720
But until then, we have a website.

1598
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:49,720
We do have a website.

1599
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:50,720
It's knowledgefight.com.

1600
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:51,720
Yes.

1601
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:52,720
We're also on Facebook.

1602
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:53,720
We are on Twitter.

1603
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:54,720
It's at knowledgefight.net.

1604
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:55,720
Go to betjordan.

1605
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:56,720
Yep.

1606
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:57,720
We're also on Facebook.

1607
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:58,720
Indeed we are.

1608
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:01,600
And if you could, please find a local charity or bail fund within your area to help out

1609
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,320
people doing God's work right now.

1610
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:04,320
Yep.

1611
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:05,320
We'll be back.

1612
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:06,320
But until then, I'm Neo.

1613
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:07,320
I'm Leo.

1614
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:08,320
I'm DZX Clark.

1615
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:09,320
I'm Daryl Rundis.

1616
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:10,320
And now, here comes the sex robots.

1617
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:11,320
Andy in Kansas.

1618
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:12,320
You're on the air.

1619
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:13,320
Thanks for holding.

1620
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:14,320
Hello, Alex.

1621
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,320
I'm a first time caller.

1622
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:17,320
I'm a huge fan.

1623
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:18,320
I love your work.
