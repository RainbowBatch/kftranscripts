00:00.000 --> 00:23.960
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys, a knowledge

00:23.960 --> 00:24.960
fight.

00:24.960 --> 00:29.360
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying we are the bad guys, a knowledge

00:29.360 --> 00:58.920
fight.

00:59.360 --> 01:00.360
Hey everybody!

01:00.360 --> 01:01.360
Welcome back to Knowledge Fight.

01:01.360 --> 01:02.360
I'm Dan.

01:02.360 --> 01:03.360
I'm Jordan.

01:03.360 --> 01:04.360
We're a couple dudes.

01:04.360 --> 01:06.240
I'd like to sit around, worship at the altar of Selene, and talk a little bit about Alex

01:06.240 --> 01:07.240
Jones.

01:07.240 --> 01:08.240
Oh indeed we are, Dan.

01:08.240 --> 01:09.240
Jordan.

01:09.240 --> 01:10.240
Dan.

01:10.240 --> 01:11.240
Jordan.

01:11.240 --> 01:12.240
I have a quick question for you.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.240
What's up?

01:13.240 --> 01:14.240
What's your bright spot today?

01:14.240 --> 01:15.240
Unprecedented, Jordan.

01:15.240 --> 01:17.920
My bright spot is the same thing it was last episode.

01:17.920 --> 01:20.040
The tick.

01:20.040 --> 01:21.040
I finished it.

01:21.040 --> 01:22.040
Oh, you finished it?

01:22.040 --> 01:23.040
The whole thing?

01:23.040 --> 01:24.560
Did you start back in the cartoon again?

01:24.560 --> 01:28.520
No, I watched all of the Amazon original series because I just couldn't stop.

01:28.520 --> 01:31.160
It was just too enjoyable and too fun.

01:31.160 --> 01:32.880
Everybody is just great in it.

01:32.880 --> 01:33.880
All the characters are great.

01:33.880 --> 01:35.960
John Hodgman in the second season.

01:35.960 --> 01:36.960
Fantastic.

01:36.960 --> 01:37.960
Ah, it's just great.

01:37.960 --> 01:44.000
Yeah, that was such a fun surprise when Hodgman showed up and you're like, what are you doing

01:44.000 --> 01:45.200
here, John Hodgman?

01:45.200 --> 01:49.160
And it's John Hodgman, so you're like, well, he's going to be a small role or whatever.

01:49.160 --> 01:51.160
Yeah, exactly.

01:51.160 --> 01:54.960
I know that there's a lot of other things we need to complain about Amazon and Bezos

01:54.960 --> 01:55.960
about.

01:55.960 --> 01:56.960
True.

01:56.960 --> 01:57.960
Obviously.

01:57.960 --> 02:04.760
Amazon is going to rank really high in terms of other complaints like, you know, unionization

02:04.760 --> 02:05.760
squashing.

02:05.760 --> 02:06.760
Sure, sure.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.080
There's a lot of problems with Amazon.

02:08.080 --> 02:09.840
It's in the top 50.

02:09.840 --> 02:10.840
Maybe.

02:10.840 --> 02:11.840
Yeah.

02:11.840 --> 02:15.280
Not having a third season of the tick is right up there.

02:15.280 --> 02:17.580
Just barely broke the top 50.

02:17.580 --> 02:19.500
Maybe 48, could be 49.

02:19.500 --> 02:22.480
It's like how Alex complains about the robots at the grocery store.

02:22.480 --> 02:24.040
He's like, and then I have to bag our own groceries.

02:24.040 --> 02:25.040
No, it's not my main complaint.

02:25.040 --> 02:29.280
That's how I feel about the canceling of the tick.

02:29.280 --> 02:34.200
It's the bagging your own groceries of media consumption.

02:34.200 --> 02:35.200
Just a delight.

02:35.200 --> 02:36.200
It makes sense.

02:36.200 --> 02:37.200
Anyway, what about you?

02:37.200 --> 02:38.200
It's fantastic.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.040
I will, I'm going to announce this now.

02:40.040 --> 02:44.200
I'm very excited to make an announcement, Dan, I will be making a return to stand up

02:44.200 --> 02:45.200
post COVID.

02:45.200 --> 02:46.200
Whoa.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.200
That's true.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.480
I was booked for my first stand up gig.

02:49.480 --> 02:57.360
You had some offers during the time that COVID was really sort of iffy, you know, like pre-vaccination

02:57.360 --> 02:58.360
coming around.

02:58.360 --> 02:59.360
Totally.

02:59.360 --> 03:00.360
I didn't want to do it.

03:00.360 --> 03:01.360
Yeah.

03:01.360 --> 03:02.360
I couldn't put people in that situation.

03:02.360 --> 03:04.360
I thought that was a really responsible choice on your part.

03:04.360 --> 03:05.360
Yep.

03:05.360 --> 03:12.760
Now it is in October and it was booked by friend of the show, Matt Drufke.

03:12.760 --> 03:17.440
So apparently there are a lot of people with a higher Q rating than to get through before

03:17.440 --> 03:21.680
my booking, but I'm excited to announce that here.

03:21.680 --> 03:25.400
I feel like there was some open questions about whether or not you even were going to

03:25.400 --> 03:26.400
continue pursuing.

03:26.400 --> 03:31.000
So like I was, that might've led to less people being interested in requesting.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Totally.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Totally.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.920
No, I had basically stopped before the pandemic, but now that the pandemic's over, I can't

03:36.920 --> 03:42.200
like not see if I want to give it another, you know, maybe give it a shot.

03:42.200 --> 03:45.040
See if you still connect with that kind of expression.

03:45.040 --> 03:46.960
See if I still get the feeling.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.640
It's always fun to do one of the shows, the Drufke books too.

03:49.640 --> 03:50.640
Oh, always.

03:50.640 --> 03:52.400
Although you probably have to go to the burbs then, right?

03:52.400 --> 03:54.280
I will probably have to go to the burbs.

03:54.280 --> 03:55.280
Yeah.

03:55.280 --> 03:56.280
Yep.

03:56.280 --> 03:57.280
Yep.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.280
I'll come with you.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.280
Back where I started.

03:59.280 --> 04:00.400
I'll make this announcement here.

04:00.400 --> 04:03.000
I will be there as well.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Not performing, but I will be there.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
No, no.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
That'll be exciting.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Yeah.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
It'd be nice to see Druffles.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Yeah.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.800
It'd be nice to take over the entire show and how it just all wonks and then the rest

04:14.800 --> 04:18.280
of the comics are like, I don't understand what's happening right now.

04:18.280 --> 04:20.640
None of these people know.

04:20.640 --> 04:23.240
Let's not take over anything.

04:23.240 --> 04:24.240
No.

04:24.240 --> 04:28.440
Jordan, today we have a present day episode of the Alex Jones show to discuss.

04:28.440 --> 04:29.440
Oh boy.

04:29.440 --> 04:33.920
I am trying to shoot for something a little bit different.

04:33.920 --> 04:39.800
I'm trying to take an analytical perspective of even myself and how I engage with the material

04:39.800 --> 04:40.800
that we're covering.

04:40.800 --> 04:41.800
All right.

04:41.800 --> 04:44.680
And I think that one of the main problems that I have with the present day is sometimes

04:44.680 --> 04:46.720
I try to bite off more than I can chew.

04:46.720 --> 04:47.720
Okay.

04:47.720 --> 04:50.440
And by that, I mean covering more than one day at a time.

04:50.440 --> 04:55.120
I think that's really hard in the present day because Alex's mood is never the same.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.120
No.

04:56.120 --> 04:57.120
Two days in a row.

04:57.120 --> 04:58.120
Yeah.

04:58.120 --> 05:02.280
If you expect him to cover one piece of news that he was really big on a Monday, he probably

05:02.280 --> 05:04.080
is going to forget about it by Tuesday.

05:04.080 --> 05:05.080
Yeah.

05:05.080 --> 05:08.800
We're all going to be dead on Tuesday, Wednesday, we're winning.

05:08.800 --> 05:14.600
It's just incoherent to the point where it's painful for me to try and make it palatable

05:14.600 --> 05:16.360
to an audience.

05:16.360 --> 05:19.680
And it's frustrating to me to try and talk to you about it.

05:19.680 --> 05:20.680
Right.

05:20.680 --> 05:21.680
Right.

05:21.680 --> 05:22.680
Right.

05:22.680 --> 05:23.680
Well, why is he in a better mood?

05:23.680 --> 05:24.680
I don't know.

05:24.680 --> 05:25.680
No reason.

05:25.680 --> 05:26.680
I don't fucking know.

05:26.680 --> 05:27.680
No reason.

05:27.680 --> 05:28.680
Could be anything.

05:28.680 --> 05:29.680
He took a nap.

05:29.680 --> 05:30.680
He stubbed his toe.

05:30.680 --> 05:31.680
I don't know.

05:31.680 --> 05:32.680
Yeah.

05:32.680 --> 05:33.680
It could be anything.

05:33.680 --> 05:34.680
Yeah.

05:34.680 --> 05:35.680
It's like he used to do a serialized show and now he's doing a monster of the day kind

05:35.680 --> 05:36.680
of feeling, you know?

05:36.680 --> 05:37.680
Yeah.

05:37.680 --> 05:38.680
Everything's a bottle episode and it's fucking weird.

05:38.680 --> 05:42.360
I think that maybe a better approach to it would be to just look at a day at a time.

05:42.360 --> 05:43.360
Right.

05:43.360 --> 05:45.560
And so today we're looking at June 13th, 2021 Blackjack.

05:45.560 --> 05:46.560
Blackjack!

05:46.560 --> 05:47.560
Oh!

05:47.560 --> 05:49.000
That time I almost didn't say er.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Yeah.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
So that was nice.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
I didn't trust you to do your bit.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.080
And so I sped into the Blackjack because I knew you were trying to lull me into a false

05:56.080 --> 05:57.080
sense of security.

05:57.080 --> 05:59.040
And that shant happened.

05:59.040 --> 06:03.000
There is a meta game currently going on between us.

06:03.000 --> 06:08.200
So Alex is on one on June 13th as the kids say.

06:08.200 --> 06:09.200
Yes.

06:09.200 --> 06:10.200
Okay.

06:10.200 --> 06:11.200
He's on one.

06:11.200 --> 06:12.200
Yes.

06:12.200 --> 06:13.200
Okay.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.200
He's wiling out.

06:14.200 --> 06:15.200
He is on fleek.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.760
I disagree with your use of fleek, but we shall see.

06:17.760 --> 06:20.080
I'm not, I'm still not 100% sure what it means.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.080
That's kind of my issue.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.080
Yeah.

06:22.080 --> 06:25.840
And we'll get down to business on this, but before we do, let's say hello to some new

06:25.840 --> 06:26.840
wonks.

06:26.840 --> 06:27.840
Oh, that's a great idea.

06:27.840 --> 06:30.120
So first Reverend Dr. Robert E.O.

06:30.120 --> 06:31.120
Speedwagon.

06:31.120 --> 06:32.120
Thank you so much.

06:32.120 --> 06:33.120
You are now a policy wonk.

06:33.120 --> 06:34.120
I'm a policy wonk.

06:34.120 --> 06:35.120
Holy shit.

06:35.120 --> 06:37.360
I just started watching Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.

06:37.360 --> 06:42.920
So there's a character called, uh, uh, uh, Robert E.O. Speedwagon.

06:42.920 --> 06:43.920
Whoa.

06:43.920 --> 06:44.920
Yeah.

06:44.920 --> 06:46.200
So maybe that's a reference to that.

06:46.200 --> 06:47.200
It could be.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.200
All right.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.200
Next, Jim.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.800
No relation to a certain World War II person, Gabbles.

06:50.800 --> 06:51.800
Thank you so much.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.520
You are now a policy wonk.

06:53.520 --> 06:54.920
I'm a policy wonk.

06:54.920 --> 06:55.920
Thank you.

06:55.920 --> 06:56.920
Thanks, Jim.

06:56.920 --> 06:58.260
Thank you for surviving so long with that name.

06:58.260 --> 06:59.260
Next, Chell.

06:59.260 --> 07:00.260
Thank you so much.

07:00.260 --> 07:01.260
You are now a policy wonk.

07:01.260 --> 07:02.260
I'm a policy wonk.

07:02.260 --> 07:03.260
Thanks, Chell.

07:03.260 --> 07:04.260
Next, Randy C. Thank you so much.

07:04.260 --> 07:05.600
You are now a policy wonk.

07:05.600 --> 07:06.600
I'm a policy wonk.

07:06.600 --> 07:07.600
Thanks, Randy C.

07:07.600 --> 07:08.600
Thank you.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.920
Uh, I think I've got a couple of technocrats in the mix.

07:10.920 --> 07:13.720
Uh, first, Mr. and Mrs. Makeshift Hamster.

07:13.720 --> 07:14.720
Thank you so much.

07:14.720 --> 07:15.720
You are now a technocrat.

07:15.720 --> 07:17.360
And Kickfisterscream.

07:17.360 --> 07:18.360
Thank you so much.

07:18.360 --> 07:19.360
You are now a technocrat.

07:19.360 --> 07:20.360
I'm a policy wonk.

07:20.360 --> 07:21.360
Crikey, mate.

07:21.360 --> 07:22.360
That's fantastic.

07:22.360 --> 07:23.360
Have yourself a brew.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.800
How's your 401k doing, bro?

07:24.800 --> 07:25.800
All right.

07:25.800 --> 07:27.200
We got to go full tilt boogie on this, Watson.

07:27.200 --> 07:28.200
All right.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.200
Let's just get down to business.

07:29.200 --> 07:31.100
We ain't making that money off that heroin.

07:31.100 --> 07:33.040
Why are you pimps so good?

07:33.040 --> 07:34.680
My neck is freakishly large.

07:34.680 --> 07:37.520
I declare info war on you.

07:37.520 --> 07:38.520
Thank y'all.

07:38.520 --> 07:39.520
Yes.

07:39.520 --> 07:40.520
Thank you very much to the all of you.

07:40.520 --> 07:41.520
Mm-hmm.

07:41.520 --> 07:42.520
Mm-hmm.

07:42.520 --> 07:44.100
Now, Jordan, it's time to get deep.

07:44.100 --> 07:49.020
Giving someone life is giving someone death.

07:49.020 --> 07:54.240
You could say that life is death.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.240
You could.

07:55.240 --> 07:58.440
So, today, I'd like to say, uh, uh-

07:58.440 --> 08:00.600
I never don't silently nod with that.

08:00.600 --> 08:01.760
Just like, yeah, man.

08:01.760 --> 08:02.760
That is deep.

08:02.760 --> 08:03.760
That is deep.

08:03.760 --> 08:08.600
So, uh, today, I'd like to say happy birthday and congratulations on the graduation to Madison

08:08.600 --> 08:09.600
F.

08:09.600 --> 08:10.600
Okay.

08:10.600 --> 08:13.200
Also, I should say that this happened in May.

08:13.200 --> 08:16.120
Well, congratulations and happy birthday to you.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.960
I may have missed a message.

08:17.960 --> 08:18.960
No.

08:18.960 --> 08:19.960
No.

08:19.960 --> 08:20.960
I think they just sent it now.

08:20.960 --> 08:23.680
I think they just sent it now.

08:23.680 --> 08:26.960
I think they were like, oops, we forgot to give them that birthday shout out.

08:26.960 --> 08:27.960
Mm-hmm.

08:27.960 --> 08:28.960
Let's get on it.

08:28.960 --> 08:29.960
Happy belated birthday.

08:29.960 --> 08:30.960
Right.

08:30.960 --> 08:31.960
And congratulations on the graduation.

08:31.960 --> 08:34.000
And congratulations belated congratulations.

08:34.000 --> 08:42.440
If life, if giving life is giving death, is giving graduation just signing up for school?

08:42.440 --> 08:48.840
Look, I'm gonna, I'm gonna leave you hanging on that one.

08:48.840 --> 08:49.840
It's fair.

08:49.840 --> 08:50.840
That's fair.

08:50.840 --> 08:51.840
It's just fair.

08:51.840 --> 08:52.840
Yeah.

08:52.840 --> 08:56.000
So, one other thing was, uh, Erica sent a message, uh, and wanted a special drop played

08:56.000 --> 08:58.760
and it's something we haven't heard in a while and I thought, why not?

08:58.760 --> 09:00.280
I think the people are itching for this.

09:00.280 --> 09:02.320
So here, this is going out to you, Erica.

09:02.320 --> 09:06.720
You know, they got baby shark, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep.

09:06.720 --> 09:13.960
They got mama shark, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, daddy shark, we'll be right back.

09:13.960 --> 09:16.040
An oldie but a goodie.

09:16.040 --> 09:17.840
Always good to hear some daddy shark.

09:17.840 --> 09:18.840
Absolutely.

09:18.840 --> 09:19.840
Yeah.

09:19.840 --> 09:21.840
So, uh, we're gonna be talking about June 13th, but here is an out of context drop from

09:21.840 --> 09:22.840
today's show.

09:22.840 --> 09:29.160
You know, I would never say if I got killed, start a civil war.

09:29.160 --> 09:30.160
Good.

09:30.160 --> 09:35.560
Um, well, one, one, you would already be dead, so you wouldn't have the opportunity to say

09:35.560 --> 09:36.560
that.

09:36.560 --> 09:37.560
No, no, you're saying beforehand.

09:37.560 --> 09:38.560
Oh, okay.

09:38.560 --> 09:40.880
On the off, like my death is a dead man switch for a civil war.

09:40.880 --> 09:41.880
Sure, sure.

09:41.880 --> 09:43.120
I think I wouldn't say that.

09:43.120 --> 09:47.560
I know, but I think that's got some Jane Austen, the meaning is the opposite of the meaning

09:47.560 --> 09:48.560
kind of thing.

09:48.560 --> 09:52.920
I would never say nuke the planet when I die.

09:52.920 --> 09:55.180
Why would you need to say, I would never say that?

09:55.180 --> 09:58.240
The only reason you would need to say that is if you want that to be true.

09:58.240 --> 09:59.240
Yeah.

09:59.240 --> 10:01.360
I feel like almost nobody would say that.

10:01.360 --> 10:06.680
Nobody should say that, except for maybe Mandela.

10:06.680 --> 10:12.160
So Alex has got a piece of news here on the 13th, this is Sunday's show.

10:12.160 --> 10:16.120
On the 13th he had gotten some news that this gentleman by the name of Christopher Sein

10:16.120 --> 10:17.120
had passed away.

10:17.120 --> 10:18.120
Sure.

10:18.120 --> 10:24.520
He was a reporter, and he was the person who is credited with breaking the story of former

10:24.520 --> 10:29.200
President Bill Clinton meeting with Loretta Lynch on the tarmac meeting.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.200
Gotcha.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.200
And of course, that means this was an execution.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.280
Yeah, that sounds right.

10:33.280 --> 10:36.560
What is the next thing to come in a season like this?

10:36.560 --> 10:42.680
What is the next move always, and the move they've been carrying out all over the world?

10:42.680 --> 10:45.440
Well it's this right here.

10:45.440 --> 10:49.040
That's what it is.

10:49.040 --> 11:02.840
45-year-old Christopher Sein, the award-winning, Emmy award-winning TV anchorman and reporter

11:02.840 --> 11:07.840
who just had his book published and is doing great and was super happy.

11:07.840 --> 11:14.160
Well he got executed inside of his house yesterday, and his body wasn't even cold.

11:14.160 --> 11:18.160
The blood wasn't even coagulated before they said it was a suicide.

11:18.160 --> 11:19.160
Just like Breitbart.

11:19.160 --> 11:21.880
Hell, they'd say Kennedy was a suicide and whatnot.

11:21.880 --> 11:24.320
You know John F. Kennedy committed suicide, you know that?

11:24.320 --> 11:26.280
Breitbart, no one said that he committed suicide.

11:26.280 --> 11:27.280
That was a heart attack.

11:27.280 --> 11:29.120
Yeah, they said he did a lot of coke.

11:29.120 --> 11:30.120
Yeah.

11:30.120 --> 11:35.480
The situation with this is the reporting on it is that it's being treated as a suspected

11:35.480 --> 11:36.480
suicide.

11:36.480 --> 11:37.480
Suicide, right.

11:37.480 --> 11:38.480
Right, right.

11:38.480 --> 11:40.600
Not that the people are reporting that it definitely is.

11:40.600 --> 11:41.600
Sure.

11:41.600 --> 11:42.600
There aren't signs of foul play.

11:42.600 --> 11:43.600
Yeah.

11:43.600 --> 11:48.160
There aren't signs that generally would lead investigators to initially give a, this looks

11:48.160 --> 11:49.160
like a murder.

11:49.160 --> 11:52.520
Yeah, the doors were locked from the inside, like everything.

11:52.520 --> 11:55.680
I don't know all of the specifics because a lot of it I can't really, you know, can't

11:55.680 --> 12:01.320
find all the details, but you know, this is the same thing that Alex does all the time.

12:01.320 --> 12:05.560
It's like they're saying that it's suicide in order to make sure that there's a cover-up

12:05.560 --> 12:11.820
as opposed to there's reporting that preliminary indications appear to be that this was a case

12:11.820 --> 12:12.820
of suicide.

12:12.820 --> 12:16.840
And you know it's a cover-up because they're reporting that it's not a cover-up.

12:16.840 --> 12:17.840
Right.

12:17.840 --> 12:18.840
See?

12:18.840 --> 12:19.840
Makes sense.

12:19.840 --> 12:20.840
It makes perfect sense.

12:20.840 --> 12:24.840
Yeah, so one of the things to keep a real sharp focus on here is how definitive Alex

12:24.840 --> 12:25.840
is.

12:25.840 --> 12:26.840
He did not...

12:26.840 --> 12:29.840
He's reporting this as an execution in the home.

12:29.840 --> 12:30.840
He really did.

12:30.840 --> 12:36.920
It's kind of funny how that just flies over me now, just that a man can go on his show

12:36.920 --> 12:42.620
and just be like, that guy was executed with no evidence or thought or anything like that.

12:42.620 --> 12:45.320
And I'm like, well, of course he's just going to claim that.

12:45.320 --> 12:50.900
He's decrying that the media is definitively saying that it's suicide when in fact the

12:50.900 --> 12:55.800
articles that I could find about this were saying that it's being handled, the investigation

12:55.800 --> 13:01.280
is a presumed suicide until other information comes along.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.400
And Alex is doing the exact same thing.

13:03.400 --> 13:04.400
Just the opposite.

13:04.400 --> 13:08.660
He's doing what he's claiming the media is doing and that is jumping to the conclusion

13:08.660 --> 13:11.280
of not globalist execution for sure.

13:11.280 --> 13:12.920
Well, because they do it.

13:12.920 --> 13:13.920
It's disrespectful.

13:13.920 --> 13:14.920
It's okay for him to do it.

13:14.920 --> 13:15.920
Yeah.

13:15.920 --> 13:19.120
It's almost as if he forgets that there are real people involved in this story.

13:19.120 --> 13:20.120
Almost positive.

13:20.120 --> 13:21.320
He doesn't care.

13:21.320 --> 13:28.600
So he also is treating this like a real departure from the way things were, let's say yesterday.

13:28.600 --> 13:29.920
And he said, I'll never commit suicide.

13:29.920 --> 13:31.640
And he said, I'm getting massive death threats.

13:31.640 --> 13:38.160
My family, my children is from the Clintons because remember he exposed Loretta Lynch,

13:38.160 --> 13:41.360
the head of the justice department and the FBI, all they have a corrupt meeting on the

13:41.360 --> 13:44.840
tarmac and lying about it on that basically finally brought down the Clintons partially.

13:44.840 --> 13:48.400
Well, they've been waiting for a green light time to go offensive.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.640
I talked about canaries in the coal mine.

13:50.640 --> 13:53.420
His execution is a message to everybody.

13:53.420 --> 13:55.560
And I would expect to see a lot of these killings now.

13:55.560 --> 13:57.680
He was definitely murdered in my view.

13:57.680 --> 14:04.080
So this is, this is pretty definite the way he's reporting this, but also there's a number

14:04.080 --> 14:08.200
of things that he doesn't ever substantiate in any way on the show, which is to me is

14:08.200 --> 14:09.200
a problem.

14:09.200 --> 14:14.200
The first is he doesn't show or give any evidence of him saying, I will never kill myself.

14:14.200 --> 14:15.440
Yeah, I would need that.

14:15.440 --> 14:19.800
That is just something that he says about every case that he tries to make muddy.

14:19.800 --> 14:20.800
Sure.

14:20.800 --> 14:23.760
And then the other thing is he's taking things completely out of context.

14:23.760 --> 14:28.240
There is an interview that he did on Fox news, this Christopher sign, where he was saying

14:28.240 --> 14:33.480
that when he did this reporting, he was getting threats, but he does not say that they are

14:33.480 --> 14:34.960
from the Clintons.

14:34.960 --> 14:35.960
Yeah.

14:35.960 --> 14:39.520
There's a hundred different explanations for where these threats could have come from.

14:39.520 --> 14:40.520
Sure.

14:40.520 --> 14:44.720
Now, I mean, I guess if you want to jump to a conclusion that like Bill got on the phone,

14:44.720 --> 14:52.440
I mean, I guess you could do that the first person I've had killed, I guess if Alex wants

14:52.440 --> 14:58.100
to just make that conclusion jump and take the only evidence that he plays or provides

14:58.100 --> 14:59.800
at all is this Fox news interview.

14:59.800 --> 15:00.800
Okay.

15:00.800 --> 15:01.800
Okay.

15:01.800 --> 15:05.560
I mean, I think this is proof that the Clintons were threatening him, I guess he can, but

15:05.560 --> 15:06.800
he can't prove that.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.800
When was the Fox news interview?

15:08.800 --> 15:11.040
It was within the last few years.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.040
Okay.

15:12.040 --> 15:13.040
It wasn't recent.

15:13.040 --> 15:14.040
Okay.

15:14.040 --> 15:17.040
So the interview where he's getting threats is from a few years ago.

15:17.040 --> 15:20.760
But also he's saying that it was when the reporting happened and that was 2016.

15:20.760 --> 15:21.760
Right.

15:21.760 --> 15:22.760
So it's five years ago.

15:22.760 --> 15:25.720
So I'm fairly certain people have let it go.

15:25.720 --> 15:28.240
No, they just let you forget about it.

15:28.240 --> 15:30.160
No, I'm going to go with let it go.

15:30.160 --> 15:31.160
I don't know.

15:31.160 --> 15:33.200
I don't know why Hillary didn't become president.

15:33.200 --> 15:36.160
That's true because she was partially destroyed by this.

15:36.160 --> 15:37.720
Finally partially taken down.

15:37.720 --> 15:38.720
Yes.

15:38.720 --> 15:39.720
Yeah.

15:39.720 --> 15:40.720
So Alex jumps around a little bit.

15:40.720 --> 15:43.840
This is the main story he's going to cover, but he also does just throw a few darts around.

15:43.840 --> 15:44.840
Sure.

15:44.840 --> 15:45.840
Here's one of them.

15:45.840 --> 15:51.640
And yeah, now mainline doctors from Italy to Mexico, to the United States are confirming

15:51.640 --> 15:56.000
that people are seriously magnetic in some cases when they've had the shot.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.600
And then we find the literature that it's designed to grow magnetic prions in the body.

16:00.600 --> 16:03.640
So yeah, apparently Alex is on the magnet tip.

16:03.640 --> 16:05.440
Magnetic prions, huh?

16:05.440 --> 16:06.440
In the body.

16:06.440 --> 16:07.440
Uh huh.

16:07.440 --> 16:08.440
From what?

16:08.440 --> 16:12.840
Uh, iron in the blood.

16:12.840 --> 16:14.160
I would really like to know.

16:14.160 --> 16:15.160
Okay.

16:15.160 --> 16:16.160
So they grow them inside the body.

16:16.160 --> 16:21.280
Do they inject you first and then they like, is it like an embryo that grows with inside

16:21.280 --> 16:23.640
you and then you give birth to a magnet baby?

16:23.640 --> 16:24.700
I don't know.

16:24.700 --> 16:25.700
I don't know.

16:25.700 --> 16:27.560
Cause Alex doesn't explain and I don't really care.

16:27.560 --> 16:29.580
I looked at this a little bit.

16:29.580 --> 16:33.400
It's just like viral videos of people pretending to get their magnet.

16:33.400 --> 16:34.400
Sure.

16:34.400 --> 16:35.400
I gotcha.

16:35.400 --> 16:36.400
So Alex is on that.

16:36.400 --> 16:37.400
He's into it.

16:37.400 --> 16:38.400
Cool.

16:38.400 --> 16:39.400
I wanted him to talk more about this, but he doesn't.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.400
Yeah.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.400
It's just a throwaway thing.

16:41.400 --> 16:42.400
It's like, yeah, everyone's turned into magnets.

16:42.400 --> 16:43.800
I want a magnet, baby.

16:43.800 --> 16:45.840
I need more information on that.

16:45.840 --> 16:48.520
I was like how small his geography is.

16:48.520 --> 16:52.960
Like this is the biggest world in the world from Italy to Mexico.

16:52.960 --> 16:56.080
The biggest amount of like, okay, man.

16:56.080 --> 16:57.080
Sure.

16:57.080 --> 17:03.880
Um, the Clintons, they're killer and this is the beginning of it because they were waiting

17:03.880 --> 17:10.000
for the green light or something to go ahead and take out people who know their dirt.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.040
The Clintons I've noticed do this in waves and people that control the Clintons do.

17:14.040 --> 17:16.560
They'll kill a bunch of people, a couple of hundred here, a couple of hundred there, and

17:16.560 --> 17:17.760
then they'll wait a while.

17:17.760 --> 17:23.280
But when they start killing, you'll see the type of group it is.

17:23.280 --> 17:27.160
People that know about Arkansas savings and loan, people that know about their corruption

17:27.160 --> 17:30.520
and you know, Africa scams and deals.

17:30.520 --> 17:34.480
But this is, I believe the first salvo and I've been predicting this is coming.

17:34.480 --> 17:37.000
What about Larry Nichols?

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
We don't talk about him.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
That's that's past.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.520
Alex doesn't bring up Larry Nichols at all here.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.640
Like he passed away within the last year.

17:43.640 --> 17:44.640
Yeah.

17:44.640 --> 17:45.640
I swear.

17:45.640 --> 17:47.800
I think we're the only people who noticed.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.660
I really, I do kind of feel sad about that.

17:50.660 --> 17:55.520
We talked about it when he died, but it is really a bummer that Alex doesn't even bring

17:55.520 --> 17:56.520
up.

17:56.520 --> 18:01.920
This is if you're doing Clinton conspiracies, you got to bring up the Larry Nichols.

18:01.920 --> 18:07.240
You got to say like, oh, isn't it convenient that now when they start back up their killings,

18:07.240 --> 18:09.120
Larry Nichols is no longer with us.

18:09.120 --> 18:10.120
In waves.

18:10.120 --> 18:11.120
Silenced.

18:11.120 --> 18:12.920
Silenced because he's the Oracle.

18:12.920 --> 18:14.040
Oh man.

18:14.040 --> 18:15.760
Why would they kill in waves?

18:15.760 --> 18:17.840
Doesn't that make less sense?

18:17.840 --> 18:24.760
No, you gotta, you gotta kill in a wave and then let the tide go out, let tension ebb

18:24.760 --> 18:25.760
and then come back.

18:25.760 --> 18:26.760
I don't know.

18:26.760 --> 18:32.280
I feel like a bunch of connected killings in a short period of time and then a long

18:32.280 --> 18:38.820
series of length of quiet time would more suggest that it was a, you know, assassination

18:38.820 --> 18:41.360
instead of like an isolated event.

18:41.360 --> 18:42.360
Hmm.

18:42.360 --> 18:45.680
Well, it's good thing that you're not on their trail.

18:45.680 --> 18:50.000
I did watch mine Hunter.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
I think I've got it.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Yeah.

18:52.000 --> 18:58.200
So we got another, uh, stray dart here off of the assassination, uh, uh, narrative.

18:58.200 --> 19:00.040
Very bad developments on that front.

19:00.040 --> 19:08.760
A federal judge has ruled that employers can order you to take a vaccine, any experimental

19:08.760 --> 19:14.800
thing they want to have the job hell, I guess they can mandate you got to inject cyanide

19:14.800 --> 19:16.480
and by free will, you could kill yourself.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.760
And that's really the point they're getting to.

19:18.760 --> 19:25.480
So wait, how would you get a job that lawsuit filed by Houston hospital employees who refuse

19:25.480 --> 19:30.760
COVID-19 vaccine, according to Alex's politics, he should not be opposed to employers having

19:30.760 --> 19:33.680
the right to make these sorts of demands of employees, right?

19:33.680 --> 19:34.920
He swings libertarian.

19:34.920 --> 19:38.660
And based on that belief set, he should think that the employer has the right to make whatever

19:38.660 --> 19:40.280
requirements they want.

19:40.280 --> 19:43.520
And the employee should have the right to accept them as a condition of employment or

19:43.520 --> 19:45.360
find a job elsewhere.

19:45.360 --> 19:48.960
If having the vaccine requirement is something that hurts a business's ability to attract

19:48.960 --> 19:52.440
potential employees, the free market will sort that out.

19:52.440 --> 19:57.920
According to libertarian ideology, come on, it should be unfair for everybody else.

19:57.920 --> 20:01.160
Libertarianism is about fairness for me, fuck all those people.

20:01.160 --> 20:06.860
So apparently 117 employees out of the 26,000 in the Houston Methodist hospital system refused

20:06.860 --> 20:09.720
to get vaccinated and were suspended from their positions.

20:09.720 --> 20:13.460
So they sued and a judge recently dismissed their case.

20:13.460 --> 20:18.040
One of the reasons that their case can't possibly win in court is because they're in Texas.

20:18.040 --> 20:22.800
And in that state, they have very weak protections for employees in cases of wrongful termination.

20:22.800 --> 20:24.680
Oh my God.

20:24.680 --> 20:28.400
Oh, has somebody been hoisted upon their own fucking petard?

20:28.400 --> 20:33.020
In the judge's decision, they spell this out quote, Texas law only protects employees from

20:33.020 --> 20:38.140
being terminated for refusing to commit an act carrying criminal penalties to the worker.

20:38.140 --> 20:41.800
Based on that standard refusing to get a vaccine can't possibly meet the criteria needed to

20:41.800 --> 20:47.920
satisfy that charge, but interestingly, Alex's example of injecting yourself with cyanide

20:47.920 --> 20:52.320
would fit that standard for wrongful termination because that would be a criminal act.

20:52.320 --> 20:55.440
That would be the only example that fits that essentially.

20:55.440 --> 20:56.440
Yeah.

20:56.440 --> 20:57.440
Jesus.

20:57.440 --> 20:58.440
So anyway, this is-

20:58.440 --> 21:00.640
Wow, Texas is just really fucking crazy, huh?

21:00.640 --> 21:07.200
Well, I mean, they have sort of these weak protections in place and employers can make

21:07.200 --> 21:13.560
these sorts of conditions of employment and Alex is thrilled with that until he's not.

21:13.560 --> 21:14.560
Yeah.

21:14.560 --> 21:16.280
It should be unfair for everybody but me.

21:16.280 --> 21:19.160
This fits my policies until, oh no.

21:19.160 --> 21:21.460
Why is this hurting me?

21:21.460 --> 21:25.280
So now back to the main varsity storyline, which is-

21:25.280 --> 21:26.280
Assassination.

21:26.280 --> 21:31.200
We'll put on screen for TV viewers, radio listeners, I suggest you go to Infowars.com

21:31.200 --> 21:33.160
and see the forbidden, verboten information.

21:33.160 --> 21:34.160
Verboten?

21:34.160 --> 21:38.480
That is the headline for today's show.

21:38.480 --> 21:43.760
Sunday emergency broadcast, and I'd say we're in quite the emergency, reporter who exposed

21:43.760 --> 21:52.600
Clinton control of FBI executed inside his home very, very professionally.

21:52.600 --> 21:56.520
The problem here is that Alex can't prove any of this and it feeds into a very dangerous

21:56.520 --> 22:01.280
cycle that we've seen play out over and over again in conspiracy culture.

22:01.280 --> 22:05.760
By Alex reporting this as a definitive execution, it can feel like he's just creating a thriller

22:05.760 --> 22:10.200
plot around a tragic death, but ultimately there's a lot more going on.

22:10.200 --> 22:14.460
Because Alex is so sure that this was a professional execution, he's giving the audience permission

22:14.460 --> 22:18.760
to be just as certain and this leads to problems so they encounter people who don't share

22:18.760 --> 22:20.480
their certainty.

22:20.480 --> 22:24.640
People like victim's family members or government officials or media figures who don't comport

22:24.640 --> 22:29.460
with the conspiracy version of this death are now suspect as being participants or engaged

22:29.460 --> 22:30.920
in the cover up.

22:30.920 --> 22:37.000
These people often get hurt or harassed and hurt badly sometimes in these conspiracy campaigns

22:37.000 --> 22:40.560
and Alex doesn't give a shit about them or their wellbeing.

22:40.560 --> 22:45.120
There's nothing wrong with holding some skepticism or asking questions about events that happen.

22:45.120 --> 22:50.040
The appropriate thing to do then, however, is to explore the questions privately by reading

22:50.040 --> 22:54.060
or interviewing people or doing some other kind of investigative technique and trying

22:54.060 --> 22:56.480
to find some actual information.

22:56.480 --> 22:58.180
This is not what Alex does.

22:58.180 --> 22:59.720
He doesn't ask questions.

22:59.720 --> 23:03.280
He makes decisions about how to write other people's stories so they fit the narrative

23:03.280 --> 23:08.160
that he can make a profit off of and it's to the detriment of the people who are involved.

23:08.160 --> 23:09.160
Yeah.

23:09.160 --> 23:10.160
It's just gross.

23:10.160 --> 23:15.240
The worst part is just like putting that professional in there.

23:15.240 --> 23:16.240
That's okay.

23:16.240 --> 23:17.700
So we do look into it.

23:17.700 --> 23:20.280
We find out that it's absolutely a suicide.

23:20.280 --> 23:21.280
Right.

23:21.280 --> 23:24.600
Well that's how you know it was a professional because only a professional would make it

23:24.600 --> 23:25.600
so clean.

23:25.600 --> 23:26.600
Yeah.

23:26.600 --> 23:27.600
Exactly.

23:27.600 --> 23:28.600
Yeah, definitely.

23:28.600 --> 23:29.600
So there's just no escape.

23:29.600 --> 23:33.480
No evidence is evidence of the conclusion that Alex has already reached.

23:33.480 --> 23:34.480
Exactly.

23:34.480 --> 23:35.480
Yeah.

23:35.480 --> 23:36.480
You can't, you can't.

23:36.480 --> 23:40.920
And overwhelming evidence is even more evidence that the conspiracy is true.

23:40.920 --> 23:44.160
There has to be just a little bit of evidence in that sweet spot, I guess.

23:44.160 --> 23:48.200
And this is bad because, I mean, obviously I think anyone listening to our show can understand

23:48.200 --> 23:49.200
why this is bad.

23:49.200 --> 23:50.200
Sure, sure.

23:50.200 --> 23:54.200
But it's bad even more than we've already discussed and that's because Alex is presenting

23:54.200 --> 23:58.920
this as like a real escalation in things from the globalists.

23:58.920 --> 24:03.640
They're assassinating reporters in order to cover up their dirty business.

24:03.640 --> 24:04.640
In waves.

24:04.640 --> 24:05.840
And there's going to be a lot more.

24:05.840 --> 24:06.840
Exactly.

24:06.840 --> 24:08.480
And this is a crossing of the Rubicon.

24:08.480 --> 24:16.940
To go to that escalation, to start really killing people, passes a whole other Rubicon.

24:16.940 --> 24:19.800
And it's because the globalists are so incredibly desperate.

24:19.800 --> 24:24.040
But if you look at their entire posture and everything they're doing and everything they've

24:24.040 --> 24:31.400
been carrying out, I mean, they're willing to kill hundreds of millions of people with

24:31.400 --> 24:33.760
tainted vaccines, scar billions.

24:33.760 --> 24:35.300
They're willing to do anything.

24:35.300 --> 24:41.040
I just don't understand how anybody could hear this show and not think he's telling

24:41.040 --> 24:42.040
you to kill people.

24:42.040 --> 24:44.040
Yeah, that's the only...

24:44.040 --> 24:45.880
Like they've gone offensive.

24:45.880 --> 24:49.960
They're assassinating the people who are putting their business in the streets and reporting

24:49.960 --> 24:52.580
the truth, quote unquote, about things.

24:52.580 --> 25:01.160
So I don't understand how he can present like, don't do anything violent.

25:01.160 --> 25:06.480
I mean, you literally cannot use the metaphor of crossing the Rubicon because the point

25:06.480 --> 25:13.320
of the metaphor of crossing the Rubicon is that once this happens, it cannot be unhappening.

25:13.320 --> 25:14.520
That is the end.

25:14.520 --> 25:15.520
The line.

25:15.520 --> 25:16.520
Yeah.

25:16.520 --> 25:19.660
The language that he's using and the way he's presenting the story is very specifically

25:19.660 --> 25:24.720
about like, the game has changed and now the rules of engagement are different.

25:24.720 --> 25:25.720
Right.

25:25.720 --> 25:28.920
And I don't understand how he can pretend that that's not what he's doing.

25:28.920 --> 25:34.680
I don't understand how this could be the inciting incident if we're already confirmed that the

25:34.680 --> 25:39.200
people who have the vaccine are going to be killed or are already dead or whatever it

25:39.200 --> 25:40.200
is.

25:40.200 --> 25:45.040
This seems like a de-escalation of if anything, oh, thank God they're only killing individual

25:45.040 --> 25:48.460
people instead of murdering the entire country.

25:48.460 --> 25:49.960
The stakes are weird.

25:49.960 --> 25:50.960
Yeah.

25:50.960 --> 25:51.960
Yeah.

25:51.960 --> 25:53.360
They're not quite as in order as The Matrix related.

25:53.360 --> 25:57.320
I don't like that the Crossing the Rubicon is a single journalist and not the hundreds

25:57.320 --> 26:00.200
of thousands of people or millions of people who have been vaccinated.

26:00.200 --> 26:02.400
Well, it's the way that Alex needs to tell the story.

26:02.400 --> 26:03.400
That's true.

26:03.400 --> 26:04.400
You know?

26:04.400 --> 26:05.400
That's true.

26:05.400 --> 26:06.400
That's just passive murder.

26:06.400 --> 26:07.400
This is active.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.440
This is when the Cold War goes hot now.

26:09.440 --> 26:10.440
You know?

26:10.440 --> 26:13.440
So this clip is four minutes long and I think it's a ride.

26:13.440 --> 26:15.140
It's a journey.

26:15.140 --> 26:22.000
It starts with Alex intro-ing a clip of Sine, Christopher Sine, talking on Fox News.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
Sure.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.560
That clip does not get played.

26:24.560 --> 26:25.560
Okay.

26:25.560 --> 26:27.520
So this will be a ride.

26:27.520 --> 26:30.560
Instead Alex rambles about how big of a threat he's under.

26:30.560 --> 26:31.560
Okay.

26:31.560 --> 26:32.560
He makes this about himself.

26:32.560 --> 26:33.560
Well, that's...

26:33.560 --> 26:34.560
Because of course he does.

26:34.560 --> 26:35.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:35.560 --> 26:36.560
That's just par.

26:36.560 --> 26:37.560
That's par for the course.

26:37.560 --> 26:38.960
And then it ends in a way that will take your breath away.

26:38.960 --> 26:39.960
Okay.

26:39.960 --> 26:44.080
Here he is from the grave talking about all the death threats and everybody said, boy,

26:44.080 --> 26:47.600
this guy's got courage because the Clintons really come after you.

26:47.600 --> 26:48.600
Yeah.

26:48.600 --> 26:49.600
Believe me.

26:49.600 --> 26:57.480
The Clintons had all these big lawsuits filed against us by DNC party groups.

26:57.480 --> 27:01.360
And a lot of stuff that I agreed to be off record, so I'm not going to say anymore, but

27:01.360 --> 27:02.880
just believe me.

27:02.880 --> 27:03.880
What?

27:03.880 --> 27:11.760
I know some other big national talk show host that did take the threats and basically stopped.

27:11.760 --> 27:16.240
And I know some big networks do the same thing and I understand when somebody starts threatening

27:16.240 --> 27:20.240
to kill you and as you fall around, most folks back off from that.

27:20.240 --> 27:23.760
For me, it's not about being macho or a pissing contest.

27:23.760 --> 27:29.600
For me, it's just about, I got to do what God says and I feel good when I'm fighting

27:29.600 --> 27:31.680
evil and I feel close to God and I feel strong.

27:31.680 --> 27:32.680
Yeah.

27:32.680 --> 27:37.000
I want to pause it right there just to like, I think that is macho in his conception.

27:37.000 --> 27:42.800
I think that is the same endorphin rush or whatever that someone would get from posturing

27:42.800 --> 27:44.600
as a macho person.

27:44.600 --> 27:49.200
It's just put in the context and language of godliness or whatever.

27:49.200 --> 27:53.500
I mean, it's an incredibly fucked up thought to think the only time that I am close to

27:53.500 --> 27:56.280
God is when I am enacting violence.

27:56.280 --> 27:57.280
That's not good.

27:57.280 --> 27:58.280
Nope.

27:58.280 --> 28:03.280
And just to even entertain selling out makes me feel alone and weak and pathetic.

28:03.280 --> 28:06.660
So I'm just addicted to fight these people and fighting evil.

28:06.660 --> 28:12.000
So if they kill me, it's a great honor to die in the service of humanity and I'm just

28:12.000 --> 28:13.600
a very blessed person.

28:13.600 --> 28:15.440
It's not going to be a failure, folks.

28:15.440 --> 28:19.400
You have to realize that's going to be a real success if they're reckless enough to kill

28:19.400 --> 28:20.400
me.

28:20.400 --> 28:21.400
Instead, they're trying to put me in prison.

28:21.400 --> 28:25.520
They got the FBI with a bunch of fake cases they're cooking up and that's fine.

28:25.520 --> 28:26.520
I understand.

28:26.520 --> 28:27.520
You know, they sold out to evil.

28:27.520 --> 28:28.520
They've lost their soul.

28:28.520 --> 28:29.520
Sorry.

28:29.520 --> 28:30.520
That's not me, bro.

28:30.520 --> 28:35.120
So any of the options, you know, I'm going to love lawsuits, fine, whatever.

28:35.120 --> 28:36.120
I don't care.

28:36.120 --> 28:38.960
I'm going to keep getting the word out one way or another.

28:38.960 --> 28:42.200
Even after I'm present, well, that sucks, but whatever.

28:42.200 --> 28:43.200
Or kill me.

28:43.200 --> 28:45.060
That's almost the easier route right there.

28:45.060 --> 28:46.840
But here's how it works.

28:46.840 --> 28:58.120
I'm not backing down, but I will not have them kill me and then say that I killed myself.

28:58.120 --> 29:02.480
So I was thinking how they operate and what they've done to really good men to demonize

29:02.480 --> 29:03.480
them.

29:03.480 --> 29:04.480
And you know what it is?

29:04.480 --> 29:05.720
They come when you're there with your wife and kids.

29:05.720 --> 29:08.240
So I'm just going to be completely honest about this.

29:08.240 --> 29:12.680
I'm a tough guy at certain levels, but I have to really think about everything operates

29:12.680 --> 29:15.000
and the way things really are.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.600
And so I'm going to stay in this fight.

29:17.600 --> 29:22.040
But I do need 24 hour day security for my children and my family.

29:22.040 --> 29:25.000
I'm really I've got it most of the time, but I need to have real security.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.520
I mean, guys on the roof all the time.

29:27.520 --> 29:31.720
And we need to start writing profile stuff on the enemy and doing public reports on that

29:31.720 --> 29:35.060
as well, because, you know, here's the deal.

29:35.060 --> 29:36.240
I'm a canary in the coal mine.

29:36.240 --> 29:38.080
This guy was a big one.

29:38.080 --> 29:43.480
Just a reminder, two and a half minutes ago, Alex was introducing a clip of this guy talking

29:43.480 --> 29:44.480
on Fox News.

29:44.480 --> 29:45.480
Yeah.

29:45.480 --> 29:46.480
Yeah.

29:46.480 --> 29:47.480
From the grave.

29:47.480 --> 29:52.160
Anyways, before I get to that, I'm going to need to build a moat around my house.

29:52.160 --> 29:56.440
I'm going to have to have snipers on the roof, so I'm going to have chain link fences and

29:56.440 --> 29:57.440
razor wire.

29:57.440 --> 29:58.440
I'm going to do the whole thing.

29:58.440 --> 30:01.400
I'm going to need to find more people who used to work for Blackwater.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.280
Because of imaginary enemies.

30:03.280 --> 30:04.280
Right.

30:04.280 --> 30:08.680
So if we start seeing more deaths the next few days, the next few weeks.

30:08.680 --> 30:11.240
It's a message to threaten everybody to shut up.

30:11.240 --> 30:13.040
Or there might be 20 deaths by tomorrow.

30:13.040 --> 30:14.040
Ron Paul's dead.

30:14.040 --> 30:15.040
Alex Jones is dead.

30:15.040 --> 30:16.040
Tucker Carlson.

30:16.040 --> 30:17.040
The car bomb goes off.

30:17.040 --> 30:22.000
I mean, it's a very good chance they're going to turn their little armies loose on us and

30:22.000 --> 30:25.880
then to demonize good men, they'll kill Tucker Carlson, his wife, probably wait till his

30:25.880 --> 30:27.800
kids are in college or over visiting or something.

30:27.800 --> 30:29.060
And that's how they do it.

30:29.060 --> 30:31.360
So I'm calling Tucker to have a show.

30:31.360 --> 30:33.520
I've been telling Tucker, you need to get extra security.

30:33.520 --> 30:35.040
I'm going to leave it at that.

30:35.040 --> 30:37.700
And I'm going to call everybody I know and I'm calling this out on air right now.

30:37.700 --> 30:42.000
We have to go into war mode now, ladies and gentlemen, as these are criminal terrorists

30:42.000 --> 30:43.460
that carried out Oklahoma City.

30:43.460 --> 30:46.280
They burned down Waco with all those tanks and killed those little kids.

30:46.280 --> 30:47.720
They like killing people.

30:47.720 --> 30:48.920
They're child molesters.

30:48.920 --> 30:49.920
Hillary's a child molester.

30:49.920 --> 30:51.400
Bill Clinton's a child molester.

30:51.400 --> 30:52.680
Well guess what?

30:52.680 --> 30:55.000
I'm not going to be a soft target for these people.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.140
And I'm not going to let them tie me up while they blow my wife and children's heads off

30:58.140 --> 30:59.140
in front of me.

30:59.140 --> 31:00.140
Sure.

31:00.140 --> 31:03.280
So I'm going to tell the listeners right now, and I know you're going to come through on

31:03.280 --> 31:04.280
this.

31:04.280 --> 31:07.040
I don't have the budget for the real security I need.

31:07.040 --> 31:08.040
I'm going to leave it at that.

31:08.040 --> 31:09.040
I've got guns.

31:09.040 --> 31:11.760
We've got people around a lot of the time, but what is happening?

31:11.760 --> 31:17.240
I need a serious security detail all the time for my family because again, they won't target

31:17.240 --> 31:21.480
them if they, you know, they want to blame it on me.

31:21.480 --> 31:22.480
I don't know how they operate.

31:22.480 --> 31:24.360
So let them do that.

31:24.360 --> 31:28.280
And then of course, if they do start doing that, if they kill me, ladies and gentlemen,

31:28.280 --> 31:29.360
you know what to do.

31:29.360 --> 31:32.160
You know who did it.

31:32.160 --> 31:36.640
Join me, George Norrie for contact in the desert worldwide virtual UFO conference.

31:36.640 --> 31:39.760
Gotta be thrilled to have your ad playing right after that, George Norrie.

31:39.760 --> 31:42.120
What the fuck just happened to me?

31:42.120 --> 31:43.960
I told you it was a ride.

31:43.960 --> 31:45.840
What just fucking happened to me?

31:45.840 --> 31:46.840
It was a ride.

31:46.840 --> 31:51.560
Is he selling product based on getting people to pay for security for him?

31:51.560 --> 31:52.560
For his family.

31:52.560 --> 31:53.560
Yeah.

31:53.560 --> 31:54.560
Yeah.

31:54.560 --> 31:55.560
Okay.

31:55.560 --> 31:56.560
Okay.

31:56.560 --> 31:57.560
All right.

31:57.560 --> 32:00.160
Basically he's saying that if you don't buy more of his pills, his family will be murdered

32:00.160 --> 32:01.160
in front of him.

32:01.160 --> 32:02.160
Yeah.

32:02.160 --> 32:03.400
It does seem like that is his point.

32:03.400 --> 32:04.400
Wow.

32:04.400 --> 32:05.400
Yeah.

32:05.400 --> 32:09.080
I just thought, I thought it was pretty shocking that it ran into money at the end.

32:09.080 --> 32:16.360
I mean, I shouldn't be shocked, but the way that was going, it was so intense and like

32:16.360 --> 32:22.080
so off track from where that clip started and what he was ostensibly trying to do, which

32:22.080 --> 32:23.080
was cover this story.

32:23.080 --> 32:26.280
And he started talking about himself like, ah, I don't want him to kill my family.

32:26.280 --> 32:27.280
I need more security.

32:27.280 --> 32:29.800
It just seems like, okay, here's a paranoid spiral.

32:29.800 --> 32:30.800
Yeah.

32:30.800 --> 32:31.800
Yeah.

32:31.800 --> 32:32.800
Whatever.

32:32.800 --> 32:33.800
This doesn't go well.

32:33.800 --> 32:34.800
I get it.

32:34.800 --> 32:35.800
I think that's in the Alex Jones wheelhouse.

32:35.800 --> 32:42.160
But then when it turned into like using that paranoid spiral to be like, I need more money

32:42.160 --> 32:44.040
for this security detail.

32:44.040 --> 32:46.200
That's when I was like, oh, this is crap.

32:46.200 --> 32:47.200
That is.

32:47.200 --> 32:49.800
He saw that they were coming up on the commercial.

32:49.800 --> 32:55.440
He knew that he was about to go to break and he's like, oh my God, ad, perfect.

32:55.440 --> 32:56.840
I can't afford security.

32:56.840 --> 32:59.040
I need you all to pay for my security.

32:59.040 --> 33:00.040
Brutal.

33:00.040 --> 33:01.040
Absolutely brutal.

33:01.040 --> 33:02.040
Mm hmm.

33:02.040 --> 33:07.080
I don't, I, I don't know what world, I don't know what the rest of the world would look

33:07.080 --> 33:12.720
like if one day I woke up and the headline was Tucker Carlson dies in car bomb.

33:12.720 --> 33:16.060
Like what is, the IRA is back.

33:16.060 --> 33:19.560
Like what do we do with the IRA living in New York?

33:19.560 --> 33:25.320
I think if like selected people like Ron and Rand Paul and Alex Jones and Tucker Carlson

33:25.320 --> 33:34.380
all died in a short period of time, I think even I, as somebody who believes in this space

33:34.380 --> 33:39.260
as being full of misinformation and bullshit, I'd be like, there's a problem.

33:39.260 --> 33:40.260
Well fuck.

33:40.260 --> 33:41.260
There is a problem.

33:41.260 --> 33:42.260
This is an issue.

33:42.260 --> 33:43.260
They're probably still wrong.

33:43.260 --> 33:44.260
Yes.

33:44.260 --> 33:45.260
About everything.

33:45.260 --> 33:46.260
True.

33:46.260 --> 33:47.260
True.

33:47.260 --> 33:52.000
But you know, hey, maybe there is some kind of a fringe left wing terrorist group that

33:52.000 --> 33:54.920
we have not been aware of or something.

33:54.920 --> 34:01.040
That would be a shock if we discovered a strange paramount paramilitary leftist organization

34:01.040 --> 34:02.040
right there.

34:02.040 --> 34:07.320
I would, I would start having some questions if there was a convenient series of all of

34:07.320 --> 34:08.320
these people.

34:08.320 --> 34:11.840
I would say that is something that needs to be dealt with regardless of political ideology.

34:11.840 --> 34:12.840
Yeah.

34:12.840 --> 34:13.840
Oh, you know what?

34:13.840 --> 34:18.440
Even if it was just Tucker Carlson in a car bomb, I'd be like, holy shit.

34:18.440 --> 34:19.440
Something's not right.

34:19.440 --> 34:20.440
Yeah.

34:20.440 --> 34:21.440
Yeah.

34:21.440 --> 34:22.440
Yeah.

34:22.440 --> 34:23.440
Yeah.

34:23.440 --> 34:24.440
Um.

34:24.440 --> 34:25.440
What is happening?

34:25.440 --> 34:26.440
What is happening in this world?

34:26.440 --> 34:29.840
Um, so all of this didn't, I mean, all of this prediction didn't happen.

34:29.840 --> 34:35.160
There were not, um, you know, uh, this, this wave didn't, uh, no, that was the 13th.

34:35.160 --> 34:36.160
Right.

34:36.160 --> 34:37.160
Okay.

34:37.160 --> 34:38.820
And we're, we're recording this on the 17th.

34:38.820 --> 34:39.820
That's correct.

34:39.820 --> 34:40.820
Okay.

34:40.820 --> 34:42.920
Tucker is still technically alive from what I understand.

34:42.920 --> 34:43.920
Yeah.

34:43.920 --> 34:44.920
Okay.

34:44.920 --> 34:45.920
So it was Ron Paul.

34:45.920 --> 34:46.920
Oh man.

34:46.920 --> 34:49.240
You just can't kill Ron Paul with a car bomb.

34:49.240 --> 34:50.280
He's too crafty.

34:50.280 --> 34:51.280
He smells it out.

34:51.280 --> 34:56.480
So, but, but again, it seems like Larry Nichols would be exactly who Alex would want to throw

34:56.480 --> 34:59.720
into the mix on this and doesn't bring them up at all.

34:59.720 --> 35:00.720
Nope.

35:00.720 --> 35:01.720
They just forgot about him.

35:01.720 --> 35:02.720
Yep.

35:02.720 --> 35:08.200
So in this next clip, Alex salutes, uh, the, uh, the shorts, Christopher sign, and then

35:08.200 --> 35:10.120
of course makes it a about himself.

35:10.120 --> 35:11.120
All right.

35:11.120 --> 35:18.520
So a real man, somebody's parents and family can be proud of a brave die, but one death.

35:18.520 --> 35:20.360
Oh boy.

35:20.360 --> 35:22.840
The cowards taste of death a thousand times.

35:22.840 --> 35:23.840
Okay.

35:23.840 --> 35:28.720
And I'll tell you again, they are bringing us into that wheelhouse.

35:28.720 --> 35:29.720
You see it in history books.

35:29.720 --> 35:30.720
You read about it.

35:30.720 --> 35:34.040
You talk to grandpa, you tell you about it when they were alive.

35:34.040 --> 35:35.040
People go through this.

35:35.040 --> 35:36.280
People start fights and they don't leave you alone.

35:36.280 --> 35:37.760
They attack you and they start killing people.

35:37.760 --> 35:44.560
And at a certain point you're just like, well, all right, let me just roll my sleeves up

35:44.560 --> 35:45.560
here.

35:45.560 --> 35:49.800
So I don't know what to say at this point.

35:49.800 --> 35:53.720
Nobody should be offensively violent against these people, but everybody should have their

35:53.720 --> 35:57.560
eyes peeled and be ready because they've used, well, I'll talk about it next hour.

35:57.560 --> 36:02.640
I knew this was coming for a long time, folks, but I just, they're going to start the killing

36:02.640 --> 36:03.640
of journalists.

36:03.640 --> 36:05.160
Watch that's next.

36:05.160 --> 36:10.180
I don't understand what offensively violent even means anymore on his show.

36:10.180 --> 36:13.200
Keep your eyes peeled for people to attack.

36:13.200 --> 36:15.040
You're saying that we're in war mode.

36:15.040 --> 36:16.040
Yeah.

36:16.040 --> 36:20.760
Some of these people like to blow up the Waco branch Davidian course.

36:20.760 --> 36:21.760
Okay.

36:21.760 --> 36:23.040
See is their fault.

36:23.040 --> 36:24.240
Not ours.

36:24.240 --> 36:25.640
I don't understand.

36:25.640 --> 36:29.500
I don't understand what these terms even mean and the way he's using them because I have

36:29.500 --> 36:33.440
a definition of offensively violent and I don't think it's the same as the way he's

36:33.440 --> 36:34.440
using the term.

36:34.440 --> 36:36.520
No, it definitely does not seem the same.

36:36.520 --> 36:37.520
Yeah.

36:37.520 --> 36:39.040
Silence talks about karma.

36:39.040 --> 36:40.800
Oh, he should not.

36:40.800 --> 36:41.800
What goes around comes around.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.720
He doesn't want to find out.

36:43.720 --> 36:45.560
There's a large bleep in here.

36:45.560 --> 36:48.520
By the way, you don't just face God after you die.

36:48.520 --> 36:51.080
I'm only explaining to people, people call it karma.

36:51.080 --> 36:55.560
What goes around comes around, you know, report yourself in my life.

36:55.560 --> 36:57.080
I never even wanted to do bad stuff.

36:57.080 --> 37:00.920
And every time I did bad stuff happened right after, I mean, I got a great life knock on

37:00.920 --> 37:04.360
wood because I really am a pretty good person.

37:04.360 --> 37:08.960
And, and I really want, I treat people like I want to be treated and then when I don't

37:08.960 --> 37:09.960
do that, I'm guilty.

37:09.960 --> 37:10.960
Okay.

37:10.960 --> 37:11.960
And I try to make it better.

37:11.960 --> 37:14.880
I run around all these other people, man, they just think that's weak or stupid.

37:14.880 --> 37:19.880
No, what's weak is sh...

37:19.880 --> 37:22.960
And you think you're going to get away with it forever and you're not going to get away

37:22.960 --> 37:24.600
with it.

37:24.600 --> 37:26.720
That caught my attention.

37:26.720 --> 37:27.720
Big old bleep there.

37:27.720 --> 37:29.500
It was a while too.

37:29.500 --> 37:32.880
So here's a, here's what was missing from the broadcast.

37:32.880 --> 37:36.440
I treat people like I want to be treated and then when I don't do that, I'm guilty.

37:36.440 --> 37:37.440
Okay.

37:37.440 --> 37:38.440
And I try to make it better.

37:38.440 --> 37:41.680
I run around all these other people, man, they just think that's weak or stupid.

37:41.680 --> 37:44.260
No, what's weak is shitting all over people.

37:44.260 --> 37:48.780
You fucking pieces of shit, new world order.

37:48.780 --> 37:52.120
And you think you're going to get away with it forever, you're not going to get away with

37:52.120 --> 37:53.120
it.

37:53.120 --> 37:54.120
Yeah.

37:54.120 --> 37:55.120
Man, he's still bad at swearing.

37:55.120 --> 37:56.120
He is.

37:56.120 --> 37:57.280
He's just really bad at using swears.

37:57.280 --> 37:58.280
Yeah.

37:58.280 --> 37:59.280
But you know what else too?

37:59.280 --> 38:03.440
Like I watched the clip of that in the video and there's a look on his face.

38:03.440 --> 38:05.160
That's like, I did it again.

38:05.160 --> 38:10.960
There is like a look of like, I don't think he's that good of a performer to be able to

38:10.960 --> 38:13.200
give that subtle look of like, ugh.

38:13.200 --> 38:14.200
Yeah.

38:14.200 --> 38:16.440
Like he slipped and screamed obscenity again.

38:16.440 --> 38:18.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:18.440 --> 38:19.440
It's weird.

38:19.440 --> 38:20.440
It's weird.

38:20.440 --> 38:21.440
Very childish.

38:21.440 --> 38:22.440
Bums me out.

38:22.440 --> 38:23.440
Bums me out.

38:23.440 --> 38:24.560
I feel like people should learn how to swear.

38:24.560 --> 38:25.560
Yeah.

38:25.560 --> 38:28.760
For someone like myself who has a potty mouth, I accept that.

38:28.760 --> 38:29.760
Telling me to.

38:29.760 --> 38:30.760
I understand that.

38:30.760 --> 38:31.760
Yeah.

38:31.760 --> 38:33.760
It's still, the way Alex swears is a little childish.

38:33.760 --> 38:34.760
It's a little bit.

38:34.760 --> 38:35.760
Yeah.

38:35.760 --> 38:36.760
A little bit dumb.

38:36.760 --> 38:39.160
I'm not saying we should teach children swears, but I am saying as a child, you should learn

38:39.160 --> 38:40.160
them.

38:40.160 --> 38:41.160
Mm-hmm.

38:41.160 --> 38:43.440
So Alex needs to get his family more security.

38:43.440 --> 38:47.920
But he also in the snake slip is talking about them as if they're just like collateral damage.

38:47.920 --> 38:51.560
And by that, I mean, he literally says that they're collateral damage.

38:51.560 --> 38:52.560
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:52.560 --> 38:53.880
And I've already explained this.

38:53.880 --> 38:58.640
I've already, I love my family so much that I know there's no future if we don't meet

38:58.640 --> 38:59.640
these globalists.

38:59.640 --> 39:04.280
So I've taken out of my mind the opposite of a sociopath, but to where just my, my family,

39:04.280 --> 39:07.120
everything's collateral damage because it's, it's a war.

39:07.120 --> 39:08.760
It's not like I asked for this.

39:08.760 --> 39:13.160
I can't let threats against my family govern me and make me stop what I'm doing.

39:13.160 --> 39:17.840
But I will not leave on the chessboard the chance of them having their victory against

39:17.840 --> 39:24.700
me to make me a villain where they kill me and my family and then blame me for it.

39:24.700 --> 39:27.800
So I've got to have people, cause I know, I know how to look at all the angles folks

39:27.800 --> 39:30.760
and it all just like a computer, like it's working, working, working, working.

39:30.760 --> 39:31.760
The answer comes out.

39:31.760 --> 39:33.480
I always know what my answer is, right?

39:33.480 --> 39:36.480
And today I was already saying I need more security.

39:36.480 --> 39:39.640
I was already calling my security people and saying, this needs to be done.

39:39.640 --> 39:43.520
And then I saw this story on info wars and I went and spent two hours reading all about

39:43.520 --> 39:44.520
the angles of it.

39:44.520 --> 39:48.920
It all just went, I've got to have people in my family at all times or anytime I'm with

39:48.920 --> 39:49.920
them.

39:49.920 --> 39:51.600
That really sounds speedy to me.

39:51.600 --> 39:52.600
Yeah.

39:52.600 --> 39:56.960
This is really fucking unacceptable, dangerous shit we're tossing around here.

39:56.960 --> 39:57.960
Yeah.

39:57.960 --> 40:01.320
And the way he's connecting thoughts and the way that it's very scattered.

40:01.320 --> 40:02.320
Yeah.

40:02.320 --> 40:03.320
I'm it's a little worrying.

40:03.320 --> 40:04.320
Yeah.

40:04.320 --> 40:08.660
I assume this is all because of the, the few articles that were like, Alex was coordinating

40:08.660 --> 40:10.800
with Trump for the sixth riot, right?

40:10.800 --> 40:11.800
Maybe.

40:11.800 --> 40:15.400
I mean, he does, he does mention that a little bit and I don't actually, I didn't actually

40:15.400 --> 40:22.240
pull any clips of it cause it was disconnected from these other, this other story and like,

40:22.240 --> 40:26.280
he's totally dismissive of it and he's right to be dismissive of it.

40:26.280 --> 40:27.280
Totally.

40:27.280 --> 40:28.720
But it's, I mean, that's the only thing.

40:28.720 --> 40:31.880
These people saying this clip resurfaced, what the fuck?

40:31.880 --> 40:32.880
Yeah.

40:32.880 --> 40:37.360
Trump said we're going to the Capitol on the stage and it's like, yeah, that is, that is

40:37.360 --> 40:38.360
true.

40:38.360 --> 40:39.360
100%.

40:39.360 --> 40:40.360
Yeah.

40:40.360 --> 40:41.360
I don't, I don't think that it's related.

40:41.360 --> 40:42.360
Right.

40:42.360 --> 40:45.480
But he's just going so hard with personal shit.

40:45.480 --> 40:51.220
And then the fact that he's like the moment you go from like, we need to protect our family

40:51.220 --> 40:57.560
to like acknowledge that your family's already dead is, is when you've turned people into

40:57.560 --> 41:02.560
a holy army and there's just no, I mean that is in some ways crossing the Rubicon if you

41:02.560 --> 41:03.560
will.

41:03.560 --> 41:06.240
When you turn people into a holy army, that's fucked up.

41:06.240 --> 41:11.200
I don't disagree with you, but I also have heard him say stuff like this in the past.

41:11.200 --> 41:12.200
Totally.

41:12.200 --> 41:13.200
Totally.

41:13.200 --> 41:17.480
When things have gotten like fairly intense for him, he will, he will talk about like,

41:17.480 --> 41:20.320
I've just had to give my family up to God.

41:20.320 --> 41:21.360
No, totally, totally.

41:21.360 --> 41:23.160
I've heard him, I've heard him do it before.

41:23.160 --> 41:24.680
It just seems like in...

41:24.680 --> 41:25.680
It's rare.

41:25.680 --> 41:28.040
And because it's rare, it feels worse.

41:28.040 --> 41:33.760
Yeah, it's, it definitely, well in our current context, it feels portentous more than it

41:33.760 --> 41:38.400
would have in like the late nineties, you know, you didn't get the sense that everybody

41:38.400 --> 41:41.080
was kind of itching for a holy war in the late nineties.

41:41.080 --> 41:46.320
You thought they were itching for a battle over fucking Satanism or whatever it is, you

41:46.320 --> 41:47.320
know?

41:47.320 --> 41:48.320
Yeah.

41:48.320 --> 41:55.960
So Alex has spent, I'd say all of the show rambling about his own need for security and

41:55.960 --> 42:03.360
how this story about this Christopher sign is really a warning to people like him and

42:03.360 --> 42:08.920
you know, really real narcissistic shit.

42:08.920 --> 42:14.320
One quick thing, one quick thought, one quick thought, aren't snipers on the roof more to

42:14.320 --> 42:16.280
keep people in than to keep people out?

42:16.280 --> 42:20.840
I'm not sure, but Alex has many times talked about how he has snipers on the roof of Infowars.

42:20.840 --> 42:24.400
Man, I feel like that's to keep people in.

42:24.400 --> 42:25.480
I don't know.

42:25.480 --> 42:28.200
You shoot people in the back if you're sniping on top of a roof.

42:28.200 --> 42:29.200
You think so?

42:29.200 --> 42:32.280
That's the way I, that's the way I've always seen it.

42:32.280 --> 42:33.280
Interesting.

42:33.280 --> 42:37.960
Um, anyway, Alex has not covered really anything, uh, but he has a lot of news.

42:37.960 --> 42:40.840
I've got all this incredible news to cover tonight.

42:40.840 --> 42:41.840
So much.

42:41.840 --> 42:45.720
I did so much preparation for the show today and I haven't gotten to a lot of that just

42:45.720 --> 42:51.880
because I've been busy on this because they want a message to reporters.

42:51.880 --> 42:59.120
You do not report on Bill Clinton with the attorney general on the tarmac.

42:59.120 --> 43:00.120
What

43:00.120 --> 43:06.920
You do not report on this thing that will literally never happen again.

43:06.920 --> 43:14.840
And was widely reported in every outlet.

43:14.840 --> 43:15.840
All right.

43:15.840 --> 43:20.920
All the New York Times journalists dead, Washington Post dead.

43:20.920 --> 43:24.920
It seems like he's very desperate to excuse him not doing his job.

43:24.920 --> 43:25.920
Yeah.

43:25.920 --> 43:26.920
That's what it feels like.

43:26.920 --> 43:27.920
I mean it's hard.

43:27.920 --> 43:29.920
So I was like, okay, well at least he's getting introspective about it.

43:29.920 --> 43:31.480
He's got more time on the show.

43:31.480 --> 43:34.800
He can, he can get into these stories that he's failed to cover because he got caught

43:34.800 --> 43:35.800
up in this.

43:35.800 --> 43:36.800
Yeah.

43:36.800 --> 43:37.800
So here's where he goes next.

43:37.800 --> 43:38.800
Cause there's the deal.

43:38.800 --> 43:40.000
They are wimps.

43:40.000 --> 43:47.120
So they want domination and conquest and war with us because they, I mean, I'm not against

43:47.120 --> 43:48.120
nerds.

43:48.120 --> 43:51.600
I don't even get into what you call a nerd because I'm a little guy in the computers

43:51.600 --> 43:57.480
being great person, but there's a certain time wants to be an alpha, but they're not.

43:57.480 --> 44:01.600
And then they get into being nerdly and that's like their cover to commit their crimes.

44:01.600 --> 44:07.840
And then anybody that they would call in modern parlance, a Chad or someone is the enemy.

44:07.840 --> 44:12.720
And we'll show in modern Chad's while we'll inject you with poison and sit back and watch

44:12.720 --> 44:13.720
you die.

44:13.720 --> 44:20.080
They're crazy little scientists like Fauci and Gates and all of them are psychos.

44:20.080 --> 44:26.640
I don't, I don't know how I feel about Alex talking about Chad's.

44:26.640 --> 44:30.840
There's nerds bully me with their brains and I'm supposed to bully them with my bronze.

44:30.840 --> 44:32.280
I don't like it.

44:32.280 --> 44:38.960
I don't, I don't, I don't know if this is a useful way to spend time on the show.

44:38.960 --> 44:50.840
I mean, saying that some people have inferiority complexes is something that maybe Alex I mean,

44:50.840 --> 44:51.840
what's that?

44:51.840 --> 44:52.840
Somebody is on the phone?

44:52.840 --> 44:53.840
I think it's the kettle.

44:53.840 --> 44:56.020
It's for you, Mr. Pot.

44:56.020 --> 45:00.560
You know what the problem is that like some of these wimps, you know, they'll like pretend

45:00.560 --> 45:04.200
that they're constantly under attack in order to escalate the things that they're talking

45:04.200 --> 45:06.680
about to make themselves more interesting.

45:06.680 --> 45:07.680
These dorks.

45:07.680 --> 45:11.160
And they'll constantly talk about how they're so tough, even though deep down inside they're

45:11.160 --> 45:12.160
not.

45:12.160 --> 45:16.720
They'd be super into Star Wars, but they'd tell you that they weren't super into Star

45:16.720 --> 45:17.720
Wars.

45:17.720 --> 45:21.560
That way you wouldn't think they're a nerd, right?

45:21.560 --> 45:28.400
So Alex has another clip that he wants to play, it's about this guy Frank Figliosi is

45:28.400 --> 45:33.440
a former FBI agent, guy in the FBI.

45:33.440 --> 45:39.560
That does have, that's a name of an FBI agent if I ever heard one.

45:39.560 --> 45:45.320
And so Alex believes that this guy was saying that he wants Congress arrested.

45:45.320 --> 45:46.360
Not quite.

45:46.360 --> 45:47.360
Not quite.

45:47.360 --> 45:50.000
But Alex also wants Congress arrested.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.720
But he wants them to have trials.

45:51.720 --> 45:52.720
Okay.

45:52.720 --> 45:53.720
That's important.

45:53.720 --> 45:54.720
That's very nice of him.

45:54.720 --> 45:55.720
That is important.

45:55.720 --> 45:56.720
Now they already know the outcome.

45:56.720 --> 45:57.720
He's making this outrageous statement.

45:57.720 --> 46:01.440
I mean, if I was up here saying without trial, let's arrest members of Congress, I would

46:01.440 --> 46:02.440
say I should be off the air.

46:02.440 --> 46:03.680
I don't agree with that.

46:03.680 --> 46:05.240
I want a trial for everybody.

46:05.240 --> 46:10.840
Now to people like Maxine Waters and Diane Feinstein that have been proven to be on the

46:10.840 --> 46:15.680
Chinese payroll and Mitch McConnell, do they deserve to go to prison for what they've done?

46:15.680 --> 46:16.680
Yes.

46:16.680 --> 46:19.320
But I wouldn't want it without a trial because that's something that could happen to my kids

46:19.320 --> 46:20.320
or to me.

46:20.320 --> 46:21.320
I'm not stupid.

46:21.320 --> 46:22.320
That's why we have rules.

46:22.320 --> 46:23.320
So I'm protected.

46:23.320 --> 46:24.320
And so are you.

46:24.320 --> 46:27.460
But see these jerks, they always get rid of the chivalry.

46:27.460 --> 46:33.760
They always get rid of the rules, taking one step ahead, not five steps ahead.

46:33.760 --> 46:36.560
And then they're just in my wheelhouse at that point.

46:36.560 --> 46:42.400
When I say my wheelhouse, people like me, I don't want war.

46:42.400 --> 46:43.400
I don't want death.

46:43.400 --> 46:46.320
I don't want any of it, but I'm like a pig in slop once it starts.

46:46.320 --> 46:52.680
And there's a lot of people like me who've been like asleep, dormant.

46:52.680 --> 46:56.880
And I really feel sorry for the establishment because I've looked at every possible exit

46:56.880 --> 47:00.920
from this and it does not end well for them.

47:00.920 --> 47:05.880
I don't know the difference between this and someone being like, we have cells in every

47:05.880 --> 47:06.880
city.

47:06.880 --> 47:07.880
Yeah, totally.

47:07.880 --> 47:08.880
Totally.

47:08.880 --> 47:10.760
This is basically how a terrorist makes threats.

47:10.760 --> 47:16.240
This is a YouTube video of a terrorist with a fucking mask on going, we will kill you,

47:16.240 --> 47:17.240
we're everywhere.

47:17.240 --> 47:21.840
Also, fuck off with your trial bullshit.

47:21.840 --> 47:25.280
How dare you tell me that you, we want them to have a trial.

47:25.280 --> 47:26.280
We exist on show trials.

47:26.280 --> 47:27.280
Yeah, exactly.

47:27.280 --> 47:31.480
Now, if the outcome was anything other than the one that I've predetermined to be correct,

47:31.480 --> 47:33.640
then the globalists are covering it up.

47:33.640 --> 47:34.640
Of course.

47:34.640 --> 47:35.640
No, no, no.

47:35.640 --> 47:36.640
But the trial is important.

47:36.640 --> 47:37.640
Yeah.

47:37.640 --> 47:38.640
Yeah.

47:38.640 --> 47:39.640
Silly.

47:39.640 --> 47:40.640
Fuck off.

47:40.640 --> 47:43.960
Also, I love the idea that he's like, Mitch McConnell should go to prison, except when

47:43.960 --> 47:46.480
he's acting in line with what Trump wants.

47:46.480 --> 47:47.480
Well, then he's a hero.

47:47.480 --> 47:48.480
Right.

47:48.480 --> 47:49.480
Then he's a hero.

47:49.480 --> 47:50.480
Come on.

47:50.480 --> 47:53.400
As long as he's doing that, I will support him staying in office and I will defend him,

47:53.400 --> 47:55.080
but he also deserves to go to prison.

47:55.080 --> 47:56.440
You know what really shocked me?

47:56.440 --> 47:59.120
They had a Mitch McConnell story out recently.

47:59.120 --> 48:04.440
They had the gall to ask Mitch McConnell if he would see the Supreme Court justice by

48:04.440 --> 48:05.440
Biden in 2024.

48:05.440 --> 48:06.440
Oh yeah, yeah.

48:06.440 --> 48:07.440
I saw that.

48:07.440 --> 48:08.440
I'm going to ask you a question, Dan.

48:08.440 --> 48:13.080
Now, do you think McConnell said yes?

48:13.080 --> 48:18.400
I'm the wrong person to ask because I did see this story and I thought it was like...

48:18.400 --> 48:21.080
What a waste of everyone's time.

48:21.080 --> 48:22.080
This is parody.

48:22.080 --> 48:24.080
What a waste of everyone's time.

48:24.080 --> 48:25.080
Outrageous.

48:25.080 --> 48:27.240
Of course he wasn't going to do that in 2024.

48:27.240 --> 48:28.720
We've already seen him not do it once.

48:28.720 --> 48:29.720
But it's a matter of principle.

48:29.720 --> 48:32.080
No, it is not and it never was.

48:32.080 --> 48:34.940
Duh, you're all stupid if you believed him then.

48:34.940 --> 48:39.920
So Alex plays this clip of Frank Figliozzi and I think his interpretation of it is a

48:39.920 --> 48:41.320
little bit off.

48:41.320 --> 48:43.280
This is such a criminal statement.

48:43.280 --> 48:45.120
Here it is.

48:45.120 --> 48:49.480
Look, Chris Ray testified publicly on the Hill that what happened on January 6 is domestic

48:49.480 --> 48:50.480
terrorism.

48:50.480 --> 48:53.520
What have we learned from our experience with international terrorism?

48:53.520 --> 48:59.640
In order to address that problem, arresting local operatives is merely a speed bump, not

48:59.640 --> 49:00.780
a roadblock.

49:00.780 --> 49:05.500
In order to really tackle terrorism, and this time domestically, you've got to attack and

49:05.500 --> 49:10.480
dismantle the command and control element of a terrorist group.

49:10.480 --> 49:12.880
And unfortunately, and I know this is painful.

49:12.880 --> 49:14.600
Take it back to the beginning.

49:14.600 --> 49:16.640
I know this is painful.

49:16.640 --> 49:19.760
We've got to attack.

49:19.760 --> 49:21.440
That means kill and dismantle.

49:21.440 --> 49:25.600
That means dismember, shut down.

49:25.600 --> 49:30.360
The brain trust that's the Republicans that don't want to turn the guns in or have pedophiles

49:30.360 --> 49:34.980
teach the kids or open the borders and let all you weird lawyers run everything and sell

49:34.980 --> 49:35.980
us out to whoever.

49:35.980 --> 49:37.840
Well, I'm a little scumbag lawyer.

49:37.840 --> 49:40.040
I wear a fancy suit out on to me.

49:40.040 --> 49:41.040
I mean, I'll arrest you.

49:41.040 --> 49:42.040
I'm a lawyer.

49:42.040 --> 49:43.040
I'm a lawyer.

49:43.040 --> 49:44.040
I'm a lawyer.

49:44.040 --> 49:45.760
I mean, it's just crazy.

49:45.760 --> 49:49.280
I don't know if that's what I would have taken away from this.

49:49.280 --> 49:54.000
Now, I have some problems with what Figliozzi was saying just from a different angle.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

49:55.000 --> 50:00.000
I don't think that certainly the way that we have carried out a war on terror around

50:00.000 --> 50:04.000
the world is a good model for how we would approach domestic terrorism.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.200
I think that's flawed.

50:05.200 --> 50:10.080
I can't think of anybody I want dealing with domestic terrorism less than everyone who

50:10.080 --> 50:12.760
has dealt with every type of terrorism currently.

50:12.760 --> 50:16.760
Yeah, I think the proof of concept has not been good.

50:16.760 --> 50:21.960
I think that there's a lot of dangers when you start trying to apply the way that we

50:21.960 --> 50:29.220
have as a country behaved vis-à-vis international terrorism, trying to apply that to domestic

50:29.220 --> 50:30.640
issues of terrorism.

50:30.640 --> 50:34.800
I think that you run into a lot of issues and I would hope that we choose a different

50:34.800 --> 50:35.800
way to approach things.

50:35.800 --> 50:39.760
Hey, if there's anything that we know happened, it's that whenever our soldiers trying to

50:39.760 --> 50:44.020
deal with international terrorism went to those places, they viewed everybody as a possible

50:44.020 --> 50:46.840
combatant and that's what I want them to bring back home.

50:46.840 --> 50:51.000
The possibility that everyone you live with is a combatant.

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
It's not good.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
No.

50:53.000 --> 50:57.280
And I would argue with Figliozzi on that tack.

50:57.280 --> 51:04.160
And I would also say that there is something to be said for the other point that he's making,

51:04.160 --> 51:09.680
so, you know, disconnected from that point, and that is that rounding up everybody who

51:09.680 --> 51:16.040
got into the capital on the 6th isn't necessarily going to cause the kind of change that you

51:16.040 --> 51:17.720
would hope to.

51:17.720 --> 51:24.480
Prosecutorially or from a disruption of what caused this, that's not the approach that

51:24.480 --> 51:25.480
you want to take.

51:25.480 --> 51:32.860
There's a broader spectrum of decisions and things that you would want to do.

51:32.860 --> 51:34.300
I do agree with that.

51:34.300 --> 51:41.840
I just don't agree with his comparison between international terrorism and domestic terrorism.

51:41.840 --> 51:44.960
And I also agree with you that what lessons have we learned?

51:44.960 --> 51:45.960
Nothing.

51:45.960 --> 51:46.960
Nothing.

51:46.960 --> 51:47.960
Nothing.

51:47.960 --> 51:50.220
Also, Frank Figliozzi has not been in the FBI since 2012.

51:50.220 --> 51:51.220
There we go.

51:51.220 --> 51:52.220
That's what I wanted to hear.

51:52.220 --> 51:55.480
He does not speak for any organization in any official capacity.

51:55.480 --> 51:56.660
He's a pundit.

51:56.660 --> 51:58.320
That is what I was looking for.

51:58.320 --> 51:59.320
Yeah.

51:59.320 --> 52:02.640
So I just, I think that Alex's interpretation of this is silly.

52:02.640 --> 52:06.360
It's just the same thing that this hypersensitivity that you see in the right.

52:06.360 --> 52:09.680
You know, like when Biden says that the main terror threat in the United States comes in

52:09.680 --> 52:13.360
the form of white supremacist groups, and then Alex and all of his friends report that

52:13.360 --> 52:16.360
Biden said that white people are the biggest threat in the country.

52:16.360 --> 52:18.960
It's just the same game being played here.

52:18.960 --> 52:19.960
And I don't know.

52:19.960 --> 52:24.640
I mean, they're right to act like that, obviously, if there's anything that we've learned from

52:24.640 --> 52:29.360
the way that the right has behaved whenever there's even the slightest threat to their

52:29.360 --> 52:33.520
ability to act with impunity, it's to go apeshit.

52:33.520 --> 52:37.600
And clearly that's the best strategy because nobody's been able to do anything about it.

52:37.600 --> 52:38.600
Yeah.

52:38.600 --> 52:39.600
It is.

52:39.600 --> 52:40.600
It does gum up the works.

52:40.600 --> 52:41.600
It really does.

52:41.600 --> 52:42.600
Yep.

52:42.600 --> 52:44.720
So Alex, like you said, he has a lot of big news to cover.

52:44.720 --> 52:45.720
A lot of big stuff.

52:45.720 --> 52:46.720
Sure.

52:46.720 --> 52:47.720
Sure.

52:47.720 --> 52:48.720
He's got this clip of Frank Figliozzi.

52:48.720 --> 52:49.720
Yeah.

52:49.720 --> 52:50.720
Whatever.

52:50.720 --> 52:51.720
The Figs?

52:51.720 --> 52:52.720
Here's the next thing he gets to.

52:52.720 --> 52:54.360
You think he gets called Frankie Figs?

52:54.360 --> 52:55.360
Probably.

52:55.360 --> 52:56.360
A hundred percent.

52:56.360 --> 52:57.360
Has to be.

52:57.360 --> 52:58.360
Has to be, right?

52:58.360 --> 53:03.160
Here's the next thing Alex has, and this is just, I have no idea.

53:03.160 --> 53:05.600
I have no idea why this ranks.

53:05.600 --> 53:09.440
He plays a video of someone coming out as a trans man.

53:09.440 --> 53:10.440
Oh boy.

53:10.440 --> 53:12.280
And people clap.

53:12.280 --> 53:13.280
Yeah.

53:13.280 --> 53:14.880
And I don't know why he's mad about this.

53:14.880 --> 53:18.480
So they create all these people that never worked today in their life, never had a job,

53:18.480 --> 53:25.800
and brainwashed by leftist behavior and manipulation.

53:25.800 --> 53:31.360
And then all they can do is just squeal and squawk and scream because this person has

53:31.360 --> 53:33.040
declared themselves something else.

53:33.040 --> 53:35.620
It's the celebration of transhumanism.

53:35.620 --> 53:39.480
And then there's the weird social worker in the pink dress, like approvingly looking on

53:39.480 --> 53:41.880
at what they've done to people.

53:41.880 --> 53:43.040
It just goes on and on.

53:43.040 --> 54:06.320
Here it is.

54:06.320 --> 54:21.200
So these are the lost, helpless people that the system is now in total control of.

54:21.200 --> 54:27.640
I don't understand what Alex is going off of, other than there's a person speaking to

54:27.640 --> 54:34.000
a group who support them and affirm and validate them.

54:34.000 --> 54:41.000
I don't get how he can take this and be like, aha, this person has been tricked into doing

54:41.000 --> 54:42.680
this, or whatever.

54:42.680 --> 54:49.180
The only way he can do that is by complete invalidation of the existence of trans people.

54:49.180 --> 54:54.920
That's really the only way you arrive at that conclusion, is that everybody is being tricked.

54:54.920 --> 55:01.120
Yeah, no, I was kind of blown away by, you know, like I stay away from that world so

55:01.120 --> 55:10.960
much, but my family has told me about some super Christian literature written by pastors

55:10.960 --> 55:16.160
and shit that are like, here's why people think they're boys or girls.

55:16.160 --> 55:18.880
Not like this is even possible.

55:18.880 --> 55:25.760
Just blanket rejection of the possibility and pure society has failed us.

55:25.760 --> 55:30.360
So I mean, I had no idea really how deep that belief was.

55:30.360 --> 55:35.200
I thought they at least were like, oh, they're humans, you know, like it's, it's just mind

55:35.200 --> 55:36.200
boggling.

55:36.200 --> 55:37.200
Yeah.

55:37.200 --> 55:41.240
So these are the sorts of things that Alex is taking his time with, um, and man, he gets

55:41.240 --> 55:45.160
to the end of the, gets towards the end of the show and he realizes, I haven't done my

55:45.160 --> 55:46.160
job.

55:46.160 --> 55:51.760
The great Owen Schroyer is coming in to host two hours of live radio slash TV, and I'm

55:51.760 --> 55:56.560
going to go ahead and cohost with him because I got, I don't want to stay emotional, but

55:56.560 --> 56:02.960
a little preacher in the first hour, it's been most of the time that exposed the whole

56:02.960 --> 56:07.480
FBI being under the control of the deep state, get his head bought off of his house.

56:07.480 --> 56:08.480
Yeah.

56:08.480 --> 56:09.480
Yeah.

56:09.480 --> 56:14.280
I kind of wasted the first hour of the show, so I'm going to do the actual job on another

56:14.280 --> 56:15.280
show.

56:15.280 --> 56:16.760
Maybe, but I probably won't.

56:16.760 --> 56:17.760
Doubtful.

56:17.760 --> 56:18.760
Yeah.

56:18.760 --> 56:23.800
I'm going to, I'm going to be there while Owen does the work that I am supposed to do

56:23.800 --> 56:27.480
and interrupt him and keep him from doing that very same way.

56:27.480 --> 56:28.480
And I'm going to be sauced.

56:28.480 --> 56:33.280
I'm going to be drunk and I'm going to be eating a sandwich the whole time.

56:33.280 --> 56:36.040
I have, I have very little respect for this.

56:36.040 --> 56:39.440
Um, I, I understand that Alex is like, who cares?

56:39.440 --> 56:41.680
I'm, you know, the info wars is still on air.

56:41.680 --> 56:42.680
I can just do it then.

56:42.680 --> 56:44.160
Like, no, this is your show.

56:44.160 --> 56:45.160
Yeah.

56:45.160 --> 56:46.560
This is your two hour block.

56:46.560 --> 56:50.040
You can't just co-opt someone else's show and be like, Oh, that's where we're going

56:50.040 --> 56:51.240
to do the real stuff.

56:51.240 --> 56:55.840
I'm just going to fill time yelling about bullshit here and trying to get you to pay

56:55.840 --> 56:59.360
for my family's Blackwater guards.

56:59.360 --> 57:01.080
It's a, it's outrageous.

57:01.080 --> 57:02.080
It is.

57:02.080 --> 57:03.160
It's just dumb.

57:03.160 --> 57:04.160
It is very out.

57:04.160 --> 57:09.580
I would like to get mad at him when he's doing his job instead of get mad at him when it

57:09.580 --> 57:11.960
seems like he's on his own time.

57:11.960 --> 57:12.960
Yeah.

57:12.960 --> 57:13.960
Yeah.

57:13.960 --> 57:18.720
I, I do prefer, um, it feeling like we're actually responding to something.

57:18.720 --> 57:19.720
Professionalism.

57:19.720 --> 57:20.720
Yeah.

57:20.720 --> 57:22.160
We deserve a mutual professionalism.

57:22.160 --> 57:23.740
It would be nice.

57:23.740 --> 57:29.720
So Alex, uh, has some, uh, racist opinions to get to here at the end of the show.

57:29.720 --> 57:31.080
Can't close without it.

57:31.080 --> 57:32.080
Nope.

57:32.080 --> 57:34.200
So I don't even know how to set this up.

57:34.200 --> 57:35.460
It's just outrageous.

57:35.460 --> 57:41.740
It's just, I, I, within the very group killing black people and dumbing them down and shipping

57:41.740 --> 57:47.160
drugs in their neighborhoods and giving them gangster rap on record to call each other

57:47.160 --> 57:54.240
so they can then be put in prison tells you all day how much they love black people and

57:54.240 --> 57:58.200
how they're just so sweet and you drive down the road, almost all the billboards are black

57:58.200 --> 58:02.560
people for every corporation and all the big TV ads are black people.

58:02.560 --> 58:08.640
The globalist corporations are putting a black face on everything they do because they go

58:08.640 --> 58:12.840
all black people are victims and you got to be nice to them and then the corporations

58:12.840 --> 58:14.960
then you got to be black people.

58:14.960 --> 58:17.240
It's very simple camouflage.

58:17.240 --> 58:20.440
Can't have people saying you got to be black people.

58:20.440 --> 58:25.440
You are going to then sit there and carry out your operations and say black people are

58:25.440 --> 58:28.080
doing this and a subconscious level.

58:28.080 --> 58:32.360
If you hate the government, you hate the corporations, you hate the UN, you hate the chai comms,

58:32.360 --> 58:34.920
you hate all this and then it's got a black face.

58:34.920 --> 58:35.920
What do you do?

58:35.920 --> 58:36.920
Oh God.

58:36.920 --> 58:37.920
Holy shit.

58:37.920 --> 58:42.440
Racism as always is everybody else's fault.

58:42.440 --> 58:49.080
I was blown away by this sort of articulation of how Alex sees the world.

58:49.080 --> 58:50.080
Yeah.

58:50.080 --> 58:51.080
Wow.

58:51.080 --> 58:53.480
BLM gave us NWA 40 years ago.

58:53.480 --> 58:58.760
I would guess that Alex is using some sort of selection bias about all the billboards

58:58.760 --> 58:59.760
are black people.

58:59.760 --> 59:00.760
Maybe.

59:00.760 --> 59:01.760
Could be.

59:01.760 --> 59:05.600
Maybe he's getting mad because he sees some black people there and doesn't notice all

59:05.600 --> 59:06.600
of the white people.

59:06.600 --> 59:10.560
All the billboards used to be white people and now there are some with black people on

59:10.560 --> 59:15.360
it and because that's different to me, I notice it, so now I assume that it has gone 100%

59:15.360 --> 59:16.360
the opposite direction.

59:16.360 --> 59:20.720
Yeah, I'm going to ignore all of the instances of the things that don't make me mad because

59:20.720 --> 59:23.160
seeing black people in ads makes me mad.

59:23.160 --> 59:25.520
I am a child.

59:25.520 --> 59:26.600
I am a child.

59:26.600 --> 59:31.080
I think like a child and I have no higher thinking skills whatsoever.

59:31.080 --> 59:32.080
Yeah.

59:32.080 --> 59:35.400
And this is a bit much.

59:35.400 --> 59:40.840
So again, why does racism happen, Dan?

59:40.840 --> 59:45.000
It's because the government and corporations put a black face on things.

59:45.000 --> 59:51.080
It has nothing to do with, I don't know, several hundred years or fucking, let's be honest,

59:51.080 --> 59:54.040
several thousand years of massive racism.

59:54.040 --> 59:55.940
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

59:55.940 --> 59:59.400
It's because the corporations and the government now.

59:59.400 --> 01:00:01.400
That's why white people are so racist.

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:02.400
It's commercials.

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:03.720
Everybody knows it.

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:04.720
Everybody knows it.

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:05.720
It's commercials.

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:06.980
It's commercials.

01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:12.600
It's because one time I saw a black person eat McDonald's with a smile on TV and now

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:13.600
I'm racist.

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:19.800
I got to tell you, I'm not loving it.

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:26.920
So this is a bit of a lead in to a story about this recent shooting in Austin.

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:33.180
There was, I believe, a concert and there was a shooting there and Alex has some stuff

01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:37.040
to say about it and it's a mess.

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:41.400
We love God or we love Satan or are we a dumb ass that says neither one exists?

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:42.400
That's the three choices.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:46.000
You're for Satan, you're for God, or you're a dumb ass and of course Satanists are dumb

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.600
asses too, but not as dumb as those that say there is no God.

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:54.240
So here's a great example of this.

01:00:54.240 --> 01:01:02.560
Most shootings in America that you hear about that are still pretty rare are gang related.

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:05.580
So it's Hispanic on Hispanic.

01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:10.200
It's black on black and when it is a gang of whites, sometimes motorcycle gangs, it's

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:11.200
white on white.

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:16.800
Look at the Hell's Angels and the group they were fighting out in California and all over

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:20.640
the country, the Mongols.

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:22.260
So that's how it works.

01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:26.740
So when I hear about nightclub shot up in Miami, no one would say what it was about.

01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:27.740
So I looked it up.

01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:33.760
It was a black nightclub and I go, hmm, I bet black people went and shot that up.

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:35.400
Sure enough, it was two rival gangs.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:37.120
It's not about what color they were.

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:40.000
It's the reality of it.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.820
If I hear some right wing square dance going on in the middle of Alabama, I had a shooting

01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:45.820
at it.

01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:47.920
I'll go, well, that must be some white gangs killing each other.

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:50.080
And of course it happens every once in a while, it is.

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:54.360
So here's what I'm getting at ladies and gentlemen.

01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:59.800
This story is so huge because it's not about protecting black people.

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:04.440
It's about the media, the controlled corporate media, being able to set the precedent that

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:09.640
whenever they want, they can hide a fact because I can tell you right here in Austin, it started

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:10.640
with R.J.

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:12.000
Savada, who's a big Democrat.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.880
It's gotten way worse now.

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:17.200
There'll be a serious out because I lived down there when I was in a divorce.

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:19.580
I couldn't get a house, had a rental place.

01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:23.160
And I mean, there were shootings and killings down there in the most elite part of downtown

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:25.480
Second Street, all that area.

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:30.080
And you'd hear, oh, what happened in East Austin over on Chacon and 12th?

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.200
No, it didn't.

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:35.020
It happened on second in Colorado because I saw it.

01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:37.240
I heard the gunshots.

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:39.320
So that's why this is so dangerous.

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:43.360
So you've got a hip hop concert going on.

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:44.600
Who do you think is going to be at that?

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:47.320
A lot of people, but a lot of black folks wild.

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:53.720
And here's the news mass shooting in Austin, Texas leaves 13 wounded.

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:58.520
Now can you imagine if it would have been a white person that shot into a crowd of mixed

01:02:58.520 --> 01:02:59.520
people?

01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:00.520
Yes, I can.

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:02.360
It didn't matter why he did it.

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:03.600
They'd say it was white supremacist.

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:04.600
Well, yeah.

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:08.200
I mean, it's like I guess what he's saying there at the end is like if circumstances

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:10.280
were different, people would cover it differently.

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:11.440
Yeah, sure.

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:12.440
Yeah.

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:13.440
OK.

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:14.660
Sub argument.

01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:16.840
White supremacists never kill anybody.

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:17.840
Wow.

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:18.840
That's Alex's.

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:19.840
Yeah.

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:22.320
That's Alex's main argument that he is burying.

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:23.320
Man.

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:24.320
Yeah.

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:25.880
This is weird.

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:26.880
This is weird.

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:32.440
I don't know how Alex has evidence of crimes that were committed being placed elsewhere

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:33.440
in the city.

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:34.440
Yeah.

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:35.440
I don't know.

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:42.040
I love to imagine Alex just in like, you know, a duster, like a hat, like an old timey detective

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:48.880
from a noir going out there on second in Colorado, like, oh no, they're going to say this was

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:49.880
in East Austin.

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:52.800
I know it.

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:57.760
There's a guy wearing a press badge in his hat, just walking around, sir, did you see

01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:58.760
this?

01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:03.620
The only thing Alex has in common with like those sort of noir detectives is a penchant

01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:04.620
for booze.

01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:07.240
That's the only thing he has in common.

01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:08.240
Yeah.

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:09.240
Yeah.

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:10.240
Yeah.

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:15.200
I think that this is also a bit scattered in terms of thinking.

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:18.020
There's a lot of stuff going all over the place.

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:21.560
When he was in an apartment, he knew that crimes happened in different places than they

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:22.920
said they were.

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:25.240
Also all of these various shootings.

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:26.240
Yeah.

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:32.000
So what's going on here is that he believes that the media is trying to cover up the notion

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.760
that the shooter in this Austin case was a black person.

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:36.760
Yeah.

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:38.360
And so he's going to talk about this here.

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:43.260
And I disagree with his point entirely.

01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:45.240
Only Fox carried that press conference.

01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:54.360
Every other channel didn't, but the Austin American Statesman went one further.

01:04:54.360 --> 01:05:00.160
They said, editors note, police have only released a vague description of the suspect

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:02.920
shooter as of Saturday morning.

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:06.480
The Austin American Statesman is not included in the description as it is too vague.

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:07.480
They still have, by the way.

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:11.160
At this time to be useful and identifying the shooter and such publication could be

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:14.240
harmful in perpetrating stereotypes.

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:17.800
If more detailed information is released, we will update the reporting.

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:18.800
They still have it.

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:20.440
Last time I checked an hour ago.

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:21.620
So why is that so important?

01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:25.440
Why is that so over the top?

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:31.640
Because what color somebody is, what they're wearing, what they're driving, what they're

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:36.480
dressed like is evidentiary to stop them and find them.

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:40.800
So this editor's note that Alex is reading from the Statesman, I found it.

01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:44.060
And it's in the article about the shooter's arrest.

01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:46.920
At the point of the article's publication, the vague description of the shooter is no

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:51.560
longer really that important for the public safety angle that Alex is talking about.

01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:55.840
And the newspaper does not have identifying information released to them because the suspect

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:57.560
is a juvenile.

01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:02.100
There's just really simple explanations for, you know, all this stuff that Alex is claiming

01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:07.340
is so confusing and it comes from the very source material that Alex is going off of.

01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:11.120
But it's more important to try and stoke white fear and victimhood and aggrievement.

01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:19.200
Yeah, I was going to say, it's very, I don't know if I've ever heard a white dude describe

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:24.680
why what he's doing is not racist without being incredibly racist about it.

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:28.040
That is a phenomenon that Alex falls victim to quite a bit.

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:29.040
Yeah.

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:33.280
And it seems like if you were, you know, like the best a white person can probably do is

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:37.120
be like, hey, listen, I was raised racist in a racist ass country.

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:38.120
I got blind spots.

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:39.480
I'm doing my best.

01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:43.440
Please tell me when I'm being racist because I'm sure I will be.

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:44.440
It's my bad.

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:45.440
I'll learn.

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:46.440
Not Alex.

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:47.440
No.

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:48.440
No, no, no, no, no.

01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:50.560
It's a slightly different approach to it.

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:51.560
Yeah.

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:52.560
Yeah.

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:53.560
So I don't, I don't know.

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:59.360
I feel like this, this whole display at the end of the show is a real gross and made me

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:02.420
think, Hey, why didn't you get to the news?

01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:03.420
That's a good question.

01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:05.480
Or was that the big story or what?

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:06.560
So at the end of the show, right?

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:09.160
As he's going out to throwing it to Owen.

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:10.160
Sure.

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:11.160
Sure.

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:13.480
He's gets to one of the big headlines that he didn't get to.

01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:14.480
Oh no.

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:15.760
This is huge news.

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:23.080
If true, which I don't think it is coming up next hour, didn't hit this yet.

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:28.760
The Department of Defense department admits major defector has been there for over a year,

01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:35.280
provide evidence that Chinese military orchestrated the creation of the COVID-19 and release the

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:36.280
bio weapon.

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:42.640
And of course that is so huge that you're not wanting to know this.

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:44.120
You don't want people to know it.

01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:46.580
How is that possible?

01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:50.680
That is theoretically confirmation of everything he's ever said.

01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:53.320
It's theoretically the biggest news ever.

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:54.320
Biggest news.

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:58.280
That is essentially saying that China is an act of war.

01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:00.920
It's the biggest possible news.

01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:06.560
The Chinese military released a bio weapon that has killed millions of people.

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:07.560
Yeah.

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:08.560
Okay.

01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:12.560
You had two hours on air and haven't got to this story yet.

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:13.800
That's about everybody else, Dan.

01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:15.800
I needed to talk about me.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:16.800
That's such a bullshit.

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:20.160
I needed to talk about me for the first two hours.

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:21.160
So just the worst.

01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:23.760
What an asshole.

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:26.040
That is fucking horrific.

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:27.040
Yep.

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:30.480
So that's how he ends his show on Sunday and I think it's fitting.

01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:36.360
I think it all does mesh with who he is as a broadcaster.

01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:37.360
Yeah.

01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:38.360
You know?

01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:39.360
It's about himself.

01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:40.360
Totally.

01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:41.360
It's intense.

01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:43.280
It's trying to incite people towards violence.

01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:44.280
100%.

01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:45.280
It's transphobic.

01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:46.280
It's racist.

01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:47.280
It's stupid.

01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:48.280
Yeah.

01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:50.260
Yeah, it's a real murderer's row.

01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:56.200
And it's constantly self-critical of, I haven't got to the stuff that I'm supposed to do.

01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:58.440
Haven't done any of this.

01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:00.520
And pretends that it's about to.

01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:01.880
It never does.

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:02.880
No.

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:03.880
It's amazing.

01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:09.720
It is like a perpetual child who has not done the book report.

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:17.000
It is a show that is entirely around, what if you just gave that kid three hours to try

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.400
and distract himself away from revealing he didn't do the work.

01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:25.440
Yeah, it's almost a really interesting bluffing improv exercise.

01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:26.440
It is!

01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:28.880
In a way, it kind of is.

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:35.120
If it wasn't so destructive and dangerous, it might be the greatest 27 year long herald.

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:36.800
Really?

01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:39.080
It's just a non-stop barrage.

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:42.600
I mean, Alex does sing sometimes, it could be a herald.

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:43.600
Bananas.

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.280
Anyway, Jordan, we'll be back.

01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:47.280
Indeed we will.

01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:48.720
But until then, we have a website.

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:49.720
We do have a website.

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:50.720
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:51.720
Yes.

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:52.720
We're also on Facebook.

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:53.720
We are on Twitter.

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:54.720
It's at knowledgefight.net.

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:55.720
Go to betjordan.

01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:56.720
Yep.

01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:57.720
We're also on Facebook.

01:09:57.720 --> 01:09:58.720
Indeed we are.

01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:01.600
And if you could, please find a local charity or bail fund within your area to help out

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:03.320
people doing God's work right now.

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:04.320
Yep.

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:05.320
We'll be back.

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:06.320
But until then, I'm Neo.

01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:07.320
I'm Leo.

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:08.320
I'm DZX Clark.

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:09.320
I'm Daryl Rundis.

01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:10.320
And now, here comes the sex robots.

01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:11.320
Andy in Kansas.

01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:12.320
You're on the air.

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:13.320
Thanks for holding.

01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:14.320
Hello, Alex.

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:16.320
I'm a first time caller.

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:17.320
I'm a huge fan.

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:18.320
I love your work.
