7
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,200
I'm Dan, I'm Jordan, we're a couple of dudes, like to sit around, worship at the altar of

8
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,200
Selene, and talk a little bit about Alex Jones, oh indeed we are Dan, Jordan, Dan, Jordan,

9
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,200
quick question, what's up, what's your bright spot today, my bright spot today is giving

10
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:18,200
some thanks to some folks, I'd like to thank, just over the weekend we recorded a little

11
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,200
guest appearance on God awful movies, indeed we did, I'd like to thank them for having

12
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,200
us on, and also I forgot to mention this, as always, at the end of last week, an episode

13
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,200
that I recorded of a podcast called Your Music Saved Us, ah yes, came out, and I'd like to

14
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,200
thank Jay and Clifton for having me on, long anticipated, we recorded it a couple of weeks

15
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,200
ago, I was very excited for it to come out, we talked about a five iron frenzy EP, Christian

16
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,200
Ska EP that I really liked when I was younger, and it turns out I still really like, so yeah

17
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,200
that's a lot of fun, people should go check that out, they're on iTunes and what have

18
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,200
you, I'm looking forward to listening to it, so yeah, my bright spot is having a little

19
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,200
bit of fun dicking around, joining other people's shows to have a non Alex Jones related

20
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,200
fun, I think that's great, I think it's good, it can be good from time to time, yeah, how

21
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:16,200
about you? Dan, I have some exciting announcement type news, I think I know what this is, I

22
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:26,200
think you do, Dan, Thursday July 1st, we will be doing the finale, episode 8 of the 6 episode

23
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:35,200
series, gods damn wizard, and we will be doing it live at 9pm at the Lincoln Lodge in Chicago,

24
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,200
that's where we'll be doing it, it's going to be interesting, it's all coming together

25
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,200
at a very short period of time and hopefully I will finish writing it by the time we get

26
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,200
there, yeah and hopefully there will be a link that people can get tickets to that we

27
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,200
can put out or something, yeah I will tweet that out whenever it's available, yeah, this

28
00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:00,200
will be fun, although I am a little bit wary, we'll see, it's the first time being out in

29
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:07,200
public in a long time, I've gone a little bit in public, but not like live performance,

30
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:15,200
that's a little bit weird, yeah, but you know, time to get back to it man, maybe, we'll

31
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,200
see, maybe not, yeah, there's also that possibility too, so also a secondary aspect of this announcement

32
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:28,200
is that there isn't going to be new episodes of gods damn wizard, not next week until Thursday

33
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,200
July 1st, we will not be doing any more episodes of that, so look forward to it, I'll tweet

34
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:40,200
out the link and we'll put it up and you can catch up on the old episodes, hoorah, and

35
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,200
then some people have asked about this and so just to make it clear and more public,

36
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,200
like once all of it's done, you are going to release it as an audio thing, as a complete

37
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,200
audio thing, it's just video now, but it will be audio once it's all finished up and

38
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:00,200
it can be edited nice, yes, everybody needs to get me their individual audio, which some

39
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:06,200
have been very very good with, this seems like a private conversation Jordan, so today

40
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,200
on the podcast Jordan, we're going to be talking about some modern day Beasiness, we're

41
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,200
going to be talking about an emergency broadcast that Alex did on Saturday, I almost screamed

42
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:23,200
blackjack, this is from June 19th 2021, blackjack, oh that was close, yeah, that was tight, this

43
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:29,200
is an emergency episode that Alex did and I was glad that he did an emergency episode

44
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,200
because I was struggling, I was treading water, sure, thinking about covering his present

45
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,200
day nonsense, yeah, and then this emergency broadcast happened and something monumental

46
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:46,200
went down, okay, something that we have been waiting for, ooh, for a while, all right,

47
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,200
okay, so it's actually something monumental and not some bullshit, it's some bullshit,

48
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:56,200
oh okay, never mind, yeah, no, it was something I've been excited about happening, it's

49
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,200
bullshit, okay, that's fair, that's fair, so we'll get down to business on this, but

50
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,200
before we do Jordan, we're going to take a little moment to say thank you and welcome

51
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,200
in some wonks, oh that's a great idea, so first congratulations to Paul on the birth

52
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:13,200
of his first child Riley, this was sent in by Ryan, I guess we're going to say Riley

53
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,200
is a policy wonk, okay, I'm a policy wonk, thank you very much Ryan and on behalf of

54
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:23,200
Riley and Paul, yes, next, Alias McFakeName, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk,

55
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:28,200
I'm a policy wonk, thank you very much, what a strange name to be born with, yeah,

56
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:33,200
Cool Disco George, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk, I'm a policy wonk,

57
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,200
thanks, Disco George, and DJ Spouse Mouse, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk,

58
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,200
I'm a policy wonk, thank you very much, DJ Spouse Mouse, thank you, now the little

59
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:48,200
bit of a shorter policy wonk thing, but that's because, giving someone life is giving

60
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:59,200
someone death, you could say that life is death, you could, Joel had a birthday, shouting

61
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:05,200
something out to someone is also shouting something into someone, and giving life, exactly,

62
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,200
so Joel had a birthday last week, Tammy reached out, wanted to wish a happy birthday,

63
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:15,200
Joel happy birthday to you, happy birthday, Denise, how you doing out there, hope you

64
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,200
have a happy birthday, your son Will hit me up, and wanted us to wish you a happy birthday,

65
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,200
I thought it might have been Killer Mike, his mom was named Denise, is that right, yeah,

66
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:32,200
yeah, great trivia, next John has a birthday, from Theresa, Theresa says hey happy birthday,

67
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:39,200
and so do we, we joined Theresa, happy birthday, Dusty, not Dusty Springfield, not Dusty Rhodes,

68
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,200
no he's passed, this person is still alive, as evidenced by their birthday being this

69
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:49,200
week, how's old man house phone doing, oh shit, Carrie was the one who reached out and

70
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,200
wanted us to wish Dusty a happy birthday, happy birthday Dusty, and then finally very

71
00:06:53,200 --> 00:07:00,200
special from Michael, this is a happy birthday technocrat shout out, combo situation, wow,

72
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:06,200
put it all together, for Ali G, not Borat, not Borat, no not Borat, okay, okay, Ali G

73
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:12,200
aka Spills with a Z, happy birthday and you are a technocrat, I'm a policy wonk, crikey

74
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:17,200
mate, that's fantastic, have yourself a brew, how's your 401k doing bro, we gotta go full

75
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,200
tilt boogie on this Watson alright, let's just get down to business, we ain't making

76
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:27,200
that money off that heroin, why you pimps so good, my neck is freakishly large, I declare

77
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,200
info war on you, giving life is giving death, happy birthday to all, indeed, so Jordan we're

78
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:40,200
gonna start this thing off and Alex goes for an unconventional approach on this emergency

79
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:45,200
broadcast, wait, it's an emergency broadcast, yeah, and he's gonna open it with something

80
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:51,200
other than screaming, this is an emergency, yeah, okay, now I'm interested, and if I was

81
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:58,200
gauging from the title of this video, I would say that it's, the emergency is that the January

82
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:03,200
6th storming of the capital was a false flag, oh, that does not sound like as much of an

83
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,200
emergency as I was expecting, no, I don't know, I still, I mean I've watched all of

84
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,200
this, I still don't actually understand how this qualifies as an emergency that requires

85
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,200
another broadcast, yeah, don't you have to take immediate action in an emergency, you

86
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:21,200
should, or at least you need to be aware of something really fast, yes, and this is standard

87
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:26,200
info wars lore at this point, not good, it's a talking point that's really just like, yeah,

88
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,200
alright, everyone who's listening would see that headline and be like, we know, yeah,

89
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:36,200
Antifa, false flags, duh, the whole thing, FBI, CIA, Trump was probably not or is in

90
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,200
on it now, yeah, and one of the things I was really thinking about is it seems really weird

91
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,200
on first glance that Alex is doing that, having an emergency broadcast about like the 6th

92
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,200
being a false flag, all the information, yeah, but it makes some sense, I mean if you really

93
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,200
think about it, from all publicly available information, Alex seems like he's on pretty

94
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:01,200
solid footing legally speaking, sure, as it relates to the storming of the capital, okay,

95
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,200
it seems like something that's getting him a lot of attention, he constantly is trending

96
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,200
on Twitter because people are like, they found this video of him being like, Trump told me

97
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,200
to lead a march, oh man, you know, and like, I think it's probably something really good

98
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,200
to lean into for him, yeah, there's a lot of attention, there's a lot of possibility

99
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:24,200
for claiming that people are misrepresenting him, totally, I think it's probably, as long

100
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,200
as he doesn't end up defaming anybody in the process, like, uh oh, this is probably a good

101
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:36,200
thing for him to do, uh oh, there we go, there is a downside, as he is getting this attention,

102
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,200
he knows that he needs to, you know, turn it into something, capitalize, so I love that

103
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,200
crew, and I love the boom operator that's been here seven days, so I know he's gonna

104
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,200
be here tomorrow for the Sunday show, I just wanna thank them, and I'm gonna hit this big

105
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:53,200
news, then I'm gonna go right to these guests, but instead of always doing it as a footnote

106
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,200
at the end, I'm gonna do it right now, because I've got a bunch of reporters I wanna hire,

107
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:05,200
and I've got operations I wanna launch, and I've got things I wanna do, and I can't do

108
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:13,200
it without your support, so, this coming Monday morning, this big sale of high quality organic

109
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:21,200
vitamin D3, starts off with a very explicit plug, starts off the emergency broadcast with

110
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,200
an ad, well because like his staff is overworked, which seems like a him problem, that seems

111
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,200
like a management issue, you could probably hire more staff if they're overworked, or

112
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,200
cut back, or cut back, yeah, find ways to do this on more of a shoestring, sure, lower

113
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,200
your overhead, right, yeah, right, but, because these people are working seven days a week,

114
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,200
it needs to hire more people, and therefore you need B12, or two, or whatever, you need

115
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,200
vitamins, that does sound true, and they'll give you a lot of energy, right, and sometimes,

116
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,200
Jordan, you're laughing, but sometimes, sure, when you're a person who has a lot of energy,

117
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,200
people think you're on cocaine, that's, hmm, and then we've got the three new products

118
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,200
by new, the new ones that finally came in with the supply chain breakdown, that we're

119
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,200
discounting, is your habituated discounts, and I get it, and I made it that way, it's

120
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,200
my fault, but now we have to sell stuff on sale, even though it's gonna sell out, because

121
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,200
you don't buy it unless it's on sale, and then stuff's sold out for six, eight months,

122
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,200
that's okay.

123
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,200
Are you complaining to me about you?

124
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,200

127
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:38,200
all at info.warstore.com, right there, and I'm telling you, that's lightning in a bottle,

128
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:44,200
that's how we fund this operation, and people always ask, why do you got so much energy?

129
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:49,200
I remember one time I was totally down, exhausted, I've been on there about 10 hours, and I went

130
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,200
in the bathroom to take a piss, and I walked out, and one of the security guys saw me ranting

131
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,200
Rave on air, and he said, my God, or what drugs, you ain't gonna have a heart attack,

132
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,200
are you on cocaine?

133
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
I said, I hate cocaine, I'm not on drugs.

134
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,200
I said, I'm in a war.

135
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,200
Well, how'd you go from looking completely exhausted, to look like you're ready to kill

136
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,200
somebody coming out of that bathroom?

137
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,200
Oh, because I looked at that mirror, and I said, I'm not gonna be these people's slaves,

138
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,200
I'm not gonna bow out of them.

139
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:20,200
I will not be your slave ever.

140
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:25,200
And it's gonna take that type of attitude, that's gonna smash these pedophile scum, that

141
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,200
are anti-human, and are jacked into some evil.

142
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,200
So that's what I'm on, is a life force.

143
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:38,200
And to quote John Paul Jones, I've only begun to fight.

144
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:43,200
But I really appreciate this crew, and this audience, for keeping us in the fight, and

145
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,200
I need you to keep me in the fight, now.

146
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:53,200
Now, I'll give you everything I've got, because to submit to these people's death, but all

147
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,200
I need is your word of mouth, and your prayers, and your support.

148
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
Please, just give me money.

149
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,200
Wow.

150
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,200
I will fake mood swings.

151
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
That was pathetic.

152
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,200
That was really pathetic.

153
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,200
Yeah.

154
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,200
That was really sad.

155
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,200
There's two things that I love.

156
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:13,200
One is how artificial that mood swing is.

157
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,200
And if it's not, he needs to see a doctor.

158
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,200
Yeah.

159
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
Because that is outrageous, unacceptable.

160
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,200
Yeah.

161
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,200
The second thing is, when he's talking about not being on cocaine, he describes going to

162
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,200
a bathroom, which is where people do cocaine.

163
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,200
Almost entirely, yeah.

164
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

165
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,200
You know what was crazy?

166
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,200
All those stories about Studio 54 back in the day.

167
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,200
People would always go into the bathroom, and they'd just scream into the mirror.

168
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,200
They'd be like, I'm going to dance!

169
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,200
I'm not somebody who's done a lot of cocaine in my life, but I'm not going to say that

170
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,200
I never have.

171
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:52,200
But I will say that I don't think I've ever done it outside a bathroom.

172
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:57,200
I think we can include laundry rooms.

173
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,200
Hard to say.

174
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
Hard to say.

175
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,200
Yeah, so I don't know.

176
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
I think Alex is on cocaine.

177
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Yeah.

178
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,200
Or just, I don't know.

179
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,200
Everything is so fake about the passion.

180
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,200
Yeah, that's really bad acting.

181
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,200
That's really bad acting.

182
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200
Yeah.

183
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,200
But he'll continue doing that as fakely as long as you pay him.

184
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,200
Please give him some money.

185
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:23,200
Yeah, I don't like being chastised for taking advantage of his discounts and then him being

186
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,200
like, now I can't sell it at full price anymore.

187
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
That's funny.

188
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,200
Like, don't tell me.

189
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,200
Don't tell me that.

190
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,200
I put things on sale too much, and now people are used to it, and they know that I'll just

191
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,200
put everything on sale in a week if it's not on sale now.

192
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,200
They never buy anything at a real normal price, so I have to buy things on sale.

193
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,200
Fuck you.

194
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,200
That's every time.

195
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,320
Yeah, that's like if every time you went to Walgreens, they're like, oh, you're really

196
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,900
only going to buy these Reese's cups on fucking two for $3 day, huh?

197
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:56,200
You're not going to buy them on a one for $1.99 day, you piece of shit.

198
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:01,440
If one employee at Walgreens, like after Easter, like the day after Easter, their job was just

199
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,200
to boo at everybody.

200
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,200
Oh, now you want eggs.

201
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,200
You want the Easter eggs, huh?

202
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,200
Oh, they're delicious.

203
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,200
Oh, they're so good.

204
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,200
Yeah.

205
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,200
So Alex gets to some of the news.

206
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,200
All right, let me show you these articles.

207
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,200
We'll start going to these guests.

208
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
Look at these.

209
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,960
The big revolver article that's got the globalist running scared, and that's a good thing, and

210
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:28,840
we literally foresaw it and pushed it together three weeks ago.

211
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:34,060
This enemy of freedom, White House unveils new strategy to counter domestic terrorism.

212
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:40,400
They mean real Americans, laser focus on violence, the same thing Brennan, that communist pervert

213
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,400
said.

214
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,400
What?

215
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,880
White House unveils strategy to combat domestic extremism.

216
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,880
It's everywhere.

217
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,460
It's their whole operation.

218
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,720
So first of all, this article isn't on revolver.

219
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,360
Revolver isn't so much a news site as much as it is an attempt to make a new Drudge report

220
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,280
now that the Trump camp has turned on Drudge.

221
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,880
It's just a bunch of links to clickbait headlines for the most part.

222
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,680
The actual article that Alex is talking about here in this clip is from The Hill.

223
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,520
The article is not some kind of a bombshell that has the globalists running scared.

224
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,760
It's a discussion about how the plans that have been floated by Biden's administration

225
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,920
have some possibly good ideas, but also there's some serious blind spots.

226
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,920
For instance, here's a quote that's included in that article.

227
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,220
Quote, the Biden administration is rightly focused on addressing white supremacist violence,

228
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:28,000
but its strategy includes none of the civil rights and liberty safeguards that rights

229
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,360
groups and communities of color have long sought.

230
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,800
That's a criticism of Biden's plan that was put out in a statement by the ACLU, a group

231
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,600
that Alex believes is high level globalist.

232
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,480
It seems like the ACLU shouldn't be getting in the mix trying to sow doubt about the globalist

233
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,640
plans if they're on board with the globalist plans, but look, man, I'm not a 30 dimension

234
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,160
chess player or whatever the fuck.

235
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,160
Yeah.

236
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,600
If I was a 30 dimension chess player, I would say that Alex's opposition to this makes more

237
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,080
sense or no, nevermind.

238
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,080
It doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

239
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,960
On some level, if I were Alex, I would see that new plan that Biden put out as a real

240
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,120
threat to my business model.

241
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,040
One of the pillars of the plan is to quote, confront long-term contributors to domestic

242
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,040
terrorism.

243
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:16,080
In that section, they say, quote, the US government will also work to find ways to counter the

244
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,760
polarization often fueled by disinformation, misinformation, and dangerous conspiracy theories

245
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:26,200
online, supporting an information environment that fosters healthy democratic discourse.

246
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,280
I'm not sure that I believe that they're capable of achieving that goal, but if I were Alex,

247
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:34,760
I would recognize that this looks like a situation where he might not get to fly completely under

248
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,120
the radar moving forward.

249
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,720
Yeah, that might not be good for him.

250
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,280
I have some qualms with the plan, but it's not really a specific plan.

251
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,840
It's very general and critiquing the general plan is good for conversation and for fostering

252
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,840
better ideas.

253
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,840
Sure.

254
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,600
Getting the best ideas possible, but I don't think it's where the actual fights are going

255
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,600
to happen.

256
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,600
Yeah.

257
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Yeah.

258
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,720
I mean, I think the only thing about any of those plans has always got to like boil down

259
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:06,920
to, Hey, Hey guys, guys, tell me honestly, when there's a Republican president or even

260
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:11,000
this president, will this be primarily used to hurt leftist activists?

261
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,120
And the answer is 99% of the time, yes.

262
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,960
So certainly let's, let's calm it down on our plans real quick.

263
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,960
So Alex is, you know, the false flag, January 6th was a false flag.

264
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,960
Sure.

265
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,800
And you know what other people have false flagged before.

266
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:32,800
Now we know from listening to 2003 that whenever this line of conversation would come up, Putin,

267
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:38,240
it would be Alex would use Putin as an example, use it every day in 2003, slightly different

268
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,240
in the present.

269
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,080
Oh, just as the old czarist would stage attacks.

270
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,120
And just as the old KGB would do it and Hitler launched world war II on the back of stage

271
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,120
attacks.

272
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,680
Somebody was in the old KGB to remember, and it's something that corrupt declining systems

273
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,680
do.

274
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,680
Huh?

275
00:18:54,680 --> 00:19:01,720
I think his phrasing is a little weird that he would call corrupt collapsing countries

276
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,040
that did this.

277
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:08,360
You know, like it seems weird that there would be one very obvious example while 18 years

278
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,640
changes the man.

279
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,640
Yeah.

280
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,920
So Alex gets to what he's planning to do for the beginning of this emergency report.

281
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:24,640
Now I'm going to hand this over to an interview I did on Friday with one of the main lawyers

282
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,320
who is defending people arrested in the Capitol.

283
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,900
So this is an interview from Friday.

284
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,960
And then I've got an interview that some watch, but not enough of my head of security, Tim

285
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:43,360
Enlow from January 6th, when he witnessed what he saw and what happened, he ended up

286
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:51,440
telling the story a little while after it unfolded when we were on a family vacation

287
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,440
in Utah.

288
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,280
And Tim Enlow goes through exactly what really transpired and what happened.

289
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:03,600
So Alex plays like 20 seconds of like a lawyer and it's like, I don't even know how to make,

290
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,720
I don't even know how to make heads or tails of it.

291
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,260
And then a very long conversation he had with his security guard.

292
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,720
It was easier to get him.

293
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:17,040
On a family vacation, he interviewed his security guard.

294
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,400
Also Rob Dew is there.

295
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,400
Oh man.

296
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,400
Yeah.

297
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,400
What a good dad.

298
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:27,120
The Utah trip was when he went to his food supplier, my Patriot supply warehouse.

299
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:33,160
So I don't, family vacation with the security guard going to your disaster food supplier.

300
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,040
Yeah, that's, that's kind of, that sucks.

301
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,160
That's just a business trip.

302
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,240
That's not even a workcation or whatever it is you want to call it.

303
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,240
That's just going to work.

304
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,240
Yeah.

305
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,520
If you're the kids and you're along for that, you're not having a great time.

306
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,520
Bummer.

307
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,520
And you're in Utah.

308
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,520
I mean Salt Lake City is nice.

309
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,520
Sure.

310
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,880
But you don't need to listen to anything of the security guard because it's honestly just

311
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,960
exactly what they've said pretty much all along, which is, you know, Hey, we were asked

312
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:05,040
to lead this, uh, like March to the Capitol because there was another stage that was going

313
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,120
to be set up there.

314
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,120
There was going to be another rally.

315
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,760
And as far as I can tell, that makes sense.

316
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,720
It seems like everyone's actions make sense based on that.

317
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,160
Trump was on stage saying that he was going to March down with them.

318
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,160
Yep.

319
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:23,360
They're going to have another rally to give strength to the spine, needing Republicans.

320
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,360
Yep.

321
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,360
You know, and sure.

322
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,360
I don't know.

323
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,840
I found, I found the interview incredibly boring.

324
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,840
Yeah.

325
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,920
It doesn't contradict any of the things that I think are actually the problems.

326
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,920
Yeah.

327
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,920
Yeah.

328
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,520
So it's just kind of, it's on the side.

329
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:44,080
No, their defense is, I mean, it rings true just because it's the only part of the story

330
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,920
that they have told exactly the same way over and over and over again, you know, like every

331
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,920
other part of it.

332
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,920
Oh, it's a false flag.

333
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,920
Antifa was in there.

334
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:57,320
All that stuff has changed 30 times in the first week after it happened.

335
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,320
True.

336
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,380
But the story of like, we weren't instigating, we were walking here, always the same, always

337
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,380
the same.

338
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,680
And the video of Alex very clearly being like, don't do this.

339
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,480
Like it, yeah, it checks out and it does follow his behavior.

340
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,680
Even from when I was watching the live coverage on the day, the way that Harrison Smith was

341
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:22,360
celebrating it and then once Alex realized shit was going down, everything changed.

342
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,100
The coverage on InfoWars changed because Alex was in the field.

343
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,520
He didn't have control over what Harrison was doing.

344
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,520
Right.

345
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,020
And then they got the script and they realized, oh shit.

346
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:37,440
And Alex, like there's also video of like one of his employees trying to get the police

347
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,800
to let Alex get on like a megaphone to like calm the crowd down.

348
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,080
Like first of all, if you're the cop, absolutely not.

349
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,520
No, no, no, no, no way.

350
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,240
No way am I giving Alex Jones a megaphone.

351
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,640
Because what if you do and then he's like, take the building.

352
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,600
Oh, he can go rogue at any time.

353
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,880
You can't trust him.

354
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,820
He's not a, he's a rogue agent.

355
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,980
And even best case scenario, he gets up there and he's like, hey, everybody stop.

356
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,980
And then they don't.

357
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,980
Yeah.

358
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,240
It's a no win situation.

359
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,740
But the video that they have of their actions and their behavior on that day, unless somebody

360
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:11,020
can provide actual evidence of them doing that as cover for what they're doing behind

361
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:15,600
the scenes, unless that can be demonstrated, then I just, I don't know.

362
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,960
I don't think the story of Alex's actual actions that day are as important as the, the story

363
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:28,720
and the conversation about how these narratives propelled people to these actions.

364
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,720
Agreed.

365
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:35,720
I think the thing that bothers me most about people being like, see Alex, look at these

366
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,720
videos.

367
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,840
He was there and he was leading all this shit is that ultimately you're giving Alex too

368
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,840
much credit.

369
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,840
Yeah.

370
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,500
You're turning him into like Darth Vader.

371
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:53,080
He is too much of a coward to ever even come close to doing something like that.

372
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,640
And so whenever you give him that kind of like, I'm sure part of the reason that he

373
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,680
wants to do this is just so he can be like, see, look at how, look at how strong people

374
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,680
think I am.

375
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,740
Look at how much people think I could be running everything.

376
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:10,120
If only I weren't so much of a giant fucking coward, you know, coward and I mean just a

377
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,120
stumble bum.

378
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,120
Yeah.

379
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,120
Yeah.

380
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,360
Like for the brand and it's a business and all of that stuff.

381
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,680
But I mean, ultimately I really don't think he has the, the courage to do something like

382
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,680
that.

383
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,680
I would be surprised.

384
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,680
Yeah.

385
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:28,880
Um, speaking of the business though, uh, Alex does play an ad after, I think this is after

386
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,880
the security guard interview and I just thought this was really funny.

387
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,480
The globalists want all of us to be victims.

388
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,880
Everything they do is about debilitating us, dumbing us down, making us sickly and trying

389
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,560
to cut us off from each other and cut us off from God.

390
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:47,760
Well, about four years ago, the Jones family began to care out a ritual of health.

391
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,520
Every three or four days I get out a scoop of a mineral fusion or two, put it in a glass

392
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,980
pitcher, stir it up, put some ice in it, put in the refrigerator and at least once or twice

393
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:01,200
a day have a refreshing, totally healthy, nutritious drink.

394
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,760
So yeah, Alex's family has a ritual of making juice from, from powder.

395
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,360
Aye, man.

396
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:12,200
I just think it's fun to, to like call it a ritual, the globalists are trying to kill

397
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,200
us all off.

398
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,960
And so in order to fight back, my family has a new ritual, which is we make juice.

399
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,840
We make Kool-Aid, uh, pretty regularly, but it's healthy Kool-Aid.

400
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:25,520
You know, like if you've ever seen those Sunny D commercials, we're like, no Sunny D, we're

401
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,920
going to make our own stuff.

402
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,440
You know, we're cool like that.

403
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,440
All right.

404
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,800
I just think that's fun.

405
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,800
The phrasing is fun.

406
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,800
Yeah.

407
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,440
Something that's less fun is that Alex then, uh, starts having some guests.

408
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,040
Oh, that's no fun.

409
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,040
No.

410
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
Is Stuart Rhodes one of them?

411
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,040
Nick Fuentes joins us.

412
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,040
We appreciate his time.

413
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,040
Talk about this.

414
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,040
Wow.

415
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,040
What a historic point.

416
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,520
What a crazy thing to be involved with, Nick.

417
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,520
No.

418
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,000
Well, and it's a really groundbreaking new report here from Revolve where I think it's

419
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,080
blown the lid wide open on this entire situation and hopefully given some clarity about what

420
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,440
really went on on that day.

421
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,440
Right?

422
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,440
Yeah.

423
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:06,680
I think maybe baby bigot, uh, Nick Fuentes is in the mix and I kind of misspoke earlier.

424
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,880
Revolver is primarily just a link aggregator like Drudge, but they do actually post some

425
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,080
of their own blog content.

426
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,560
And I think what happened earlier is that Alex referenced a link they posted to this

427
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:20,960
Hill article when his talking point for the day was supposed to be about this blog that

428
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,200
Nick brings up.

429
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,200
Gotcha.

430
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,200
Gotcha.

431
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,880
This is just a really overwritten plea for people to insist that the only relevant variable

432
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:32,560
in terms of January 6th is whether or not law enforcement had moles inside the Proud

433
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,600
Boys, Oath Keepers, and the Three Percenters.

434
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,280
That's the only thing that matters.

435
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,480
And if law enforcement did, then the whole thing has to be a sham.

436
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,460
One paragraph really stood out to me as dumb quote.

437
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,440
If it turns out that the federal government, FBI, army counterintelligence, or a similar

438
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:53,260
agency had undercover agents or confidential informants embedded in any of the groups involved

439
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:58,800
in January 6th, the federal intelligence agencies failing to warn of a potential for violence

440
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:03,920
looks less like an innocent mistake and more like something sinister.

441
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:08,600
This is part of a discussion about how the excuse that has been used to explain the storming

442
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,840
that there was an intelligence failure, but if that's what was used, but if there were

443
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,500
any informants, then that can't be true.

444
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,800
And that's a suspicious thing that they're using that excuse now.

445
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,800
Sure.

446
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,200
Anyone who has any idea how these types of groups operate knows that this sentiment is

447
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,840
just… so dumb.

448
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,280
Groups like the Oath Keepers specifically follow a leaderless resistance model, so they

449
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,900
can avoid damage that confidential informants can't cause.

450
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:36,720
One group inside the organization might have no idea what another group is up to, and it's

451
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,680
best if it stays that way.

452
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,440
There are central figures in these organizations like Stuart Rhodes for the Oath Keepers or

453
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,960
Enrique Tarrio for the Proud Boys, but they aren't going to know what each of their

454
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,000
splinter groups is up to.

455
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,240
They set up their groups like disconnected franchises because then it's harder to disrupt.

456
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,760
This is a classic strategy that the extreme right wing has been using for a long time,

457
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,640
but specifically since the 90s.

458
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,640
And terrorists.

459
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,640
And all terrorists.

460
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:06,920
But very explicitly you can find conversations in right wing circles of this being their

461
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,320
model since the 90s.

462
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:15,080
Yeah, I mean they wanted to create an insurgent attitude and they have 100% done so.

463
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,840
Even Alex's show operates kind of this way.

464
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,000
When Millie Weaver put out Shadow Gate, it was pretty clear that Alex had no idea what

465
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,820
she was doing with her time.

466
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:27,440
He was paying for the documentary, but he didn't know what her point was, who she

467
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,720
was talking to, he didn't know anything.

468
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:34,940
She, as is the case with most of his employees, are tasked with knowing what they're supposed

469
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:39,640
to do, and operating in ways where Alex has plausible deniability to not be personally

470
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,920
implicated if something they do is a fuck up.

471
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:46,480
Pretending that an informant in any of these organizations would definitively prove that

472
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,360
the government had all the information about the group's plans is just dumb.

473
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,840
And I refuse to believe that whoever wrote this piece doesn't know that.

474
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,280
This is just sort of like a defense argument, it's not even a real argument.

475
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,720
Yeah, that's kind of ridiculous.

476
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,960
I tried to read this piece, and it basically just boils down to how there are people who

477
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:09,560
are left anonymous in charging documents for the Oath Keepers, you know, charging documents

478
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:13,880
for the Oath Keepers who were indicted in the storming, and there's names that are not

479
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,040
listed in there, like person two, person three.

480
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,960
And so like, what if these are people who are FBI agents?

481
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,960
Sure.

482
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,960
Eh?

483
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,960
Eh?

484
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,800
It's full of enticing speculation, but it literally proves nothing.

485
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,480
It's just, it's a very long article that proves nothing.

486
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,760
So then it's not even, they're not even making the argument that it's a false flag so much

487
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,760
as it's entrapment?

488
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,560
Yeah, yeah, but I mean, a false flag can mean whatever you want now.

489
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,560
Sure, sure.

490
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,560
Well, that's fair.

491
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:44,520
It is fair that words have no meaning in this world.

492
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,520
Not anymore.

493
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,520
Yeah.

494
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:53,120
So the idea is that these FBI agents inside these groups, who are now these unnamed people

495
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,920
in the charging documents, are FBI, they're all FBI agents.

496
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,920
All FBI.

497
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,920
And guess what?

498
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,920
Alex knows who they are.

499
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,920
Okay.

500
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,980
Because I have a lot of sources, and let's just leave it at that.

501
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:08,000
We know the names of the FBI agents that are actually in the building, not just informants.

502
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,480
What are they going to do, Nick, in the next few weeks and months when that's all released?

503
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,480
I mean, it's perfect.

504
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,720
And they just spun and said, yeah, we were in there to try to stop it.

505
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,000
They could, but no, they denied it all, Nick.

506
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,440
They've taken the bait again.

507
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,960
Watch this space for Alex to announce the names of his FBI agents.

508
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,960
Wow.

509
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,480
I can't wait for this not to happen.

510
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,160
Yeah, that would be, that would definitely ruin his parade if he just started naming

511
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,160
FBI agents.

512
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,160
Yeah.

513
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:37,800
So Nick Fuentes is incredibly annoying, and I find him insufferable to listen to.

514
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,000
I love him so much.

515
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
He's not talking about being banned from flying at this point.

516
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,140
But he is talking about how this, January 6th, unravels.

517
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:51,240
And when it unravels, everything comes with it.

518
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,600
It's like that sweater song by the Weezer, right?

519
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,600
Weezer.

520
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,600
Ah.

521
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,600
Not a Weezer guy.

522
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,600
No?

523
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,600
No.

524
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,600
You don't know if you want to destroy my sweater?

525
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
No, I do not.

526
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,160
Pull this thread as I walk away?

527
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,260
Not a Weezer guy.

528
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,260
Not even Pinkerton.

529
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,260
Wow.

530
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,880
I don't really love them that much either, but I know references.

531
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,880
Well, that's fair.

532
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:17,160
Anyway, if you want to destroy the globalist sweater, you pull the thread of January 6th

533
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,160
while they walk away.

534
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,160
Gotcha.

535
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,480
What's going to unravel in all of this is the myth of January 6th.

536
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:28,040
That will unravel the myth of the 2020 election, the Biden landslide.

537
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:32,440
That will unravel the myth of COVID, which was the pretext to use the mail-in ballots

538
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,960
to rig the election.

539
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,600
It's going to unravel all the events of the entire past one year and how all of this was

540
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,260
culminating in the overthrow of Donald Trump by the deep state.

541
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,800
It was all just a big color revolution.

542
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:51,000
This is one of those things that is going to, if this comes apart, will unravel a series

543
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,360
of huge, massive lies.

544
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:58,780
So Nick Fuentes has a unified conspiracy about everything that's happened over the last year

545
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,280
and a half or so.

546
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,280
Cool.

547
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,280
Yeah.

548
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,280
Yeah.

549
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,280
Yeah.

550
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,280
Mm-hmm.

551
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,280
Huh.

552
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,000
So when this goes nowhere, what's his new fucking bullshit?

553
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,360
He'll probably get back to complaining about the airlines.

554
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,360
I know.

555
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,800
I just can't stand this.

556
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,800
I don't know.

557
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,800
He'll just retreat to demographic birth rate nonsense.

558
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,880
Has anybody tried really yelling into his face though?

559
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,880
I'm sure.

560
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,880
Really loudly.

561
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,880
I'm sure.

562
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,760
But just like, no.

563
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,720
Over and over and over and over again.

564
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,800
I know that you think that you have a banshee-like power with your yelling, but I think that

565
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,480
a smug prick like Nick Fuentes is pretty immune to yelling.

566
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,480
All right.

567
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,480
We'll see.

568
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:47,360
I would assume that throughout his high school career and the few years he's been out of

569
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,240
high school, he's been getting a lot of people yelling at him.

570
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,240
That's probably true.

571
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,240
Yeah.

572
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,240
Oh, God.

573
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,240
He's so easy to hate.

574
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,240
Oh.

575
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,240
He's so easy to hate.

576
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,240
And it only gets easier.

577
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,280
And again, it's globalist interests are going to organize groups into thinking it's OK to

578
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,720
literally attack and overrun and attack white people.

579
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,200
This is the sick Marxist plan.

580
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,680
They're not going to do it according to class or do it according to race.

581
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,200
They admit that.

582
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,440
And so they do.

583
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,440
They do.

584
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,440
And you're right.

585
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,440
That's what's happening in South Africa.

586
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,840
That is what happened in Zimbabwe, formerly Rhodesia.

587
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,880
This is what's happening all across the world.

588
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,360
And you know, people are just going to have to make a really tough decision, which is

589
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,200
what are we willing to do to save our Western civilization?

590
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,920
We were given this great inheritance.

591
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,920
OK.

592
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,920
OK, Nick.

593
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:37,560
So I love when someone like a Nick Fuentes is like, I'm not racist at all.

594
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:44,960
And then he starts talking about Western heritage and our great inheritance and how it was squandered.

595
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,720
And the two examples that he has of the squandering of it are South Africa and fucking Rhodesia.

596
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,720
Yeah.

597
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,720
Yeah.

598
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,720
What do those things have in common, Nick?

599
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,720
I can't.

600
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,720
Dumb bastard.

601
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,360
Why would you believe that white people were forced to endure the injustice of continuing

602
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:04,440
to own 90 percent of South Africa?

603
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:10,160
I feel like those sorts of moments are real indications that like he's trolling.

604
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,120
Like whenever he's like, I'm not racist.

605
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,440
This is just I just care about America.

606
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,200
Like he he knows he's fucking with people.

607
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,920
Like it's it's outrageous.

608
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,820
Rhodesia means white nationalist.

609
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,820
The end.

610
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:26,040
He's just being like, hey, here's how Rhodesia should have gone.

611
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,040
We keep it.

612
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,640
Is white nationalist the end?

613
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,940
I mean, there's no other way of putting it.

614
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:37,040
We believe we should be able to go into a country, take all of their land by force and

615
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,280
violence, and then force them to work for us for nothing.

616
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,280
Yeah.

617
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,280
Yeah.

618
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,280
So anyway, fuck Nick Fuentes.

619
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,280
Fuck Nick Fuentes.

620
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,440
Alex had other guests on this show.

621
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,720
And so I deemed some of this a priority thing.

622
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,240
I got kind of tired of Nick.

623
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,760
They weren't really talking about much.

624
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,640
It was kind of just about how, like, the extreme right is so strong.

625
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,640
Sure.

626
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,640
The system is weak.

627
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,160
And you guys couldn't even overthrow the fucking capital.

628
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,160
All of this.

629
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,400
But they're going to pull that thread and all of this is going to collapse.

630
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,200
The system is done for the right is going to win.

631
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,400
That doesn't sound true.

632
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,480
Alex also has his lawyer Barnes on.

633
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,840
We're not going to listen to any of that because who gives a shit?

634
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,840
Good work, Barnes.

635
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,840
Yeah.

636
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,840
You didn't even make it onto our show.

637
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,560
Nope.

638
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,680
Just bored me.

639
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,680
Try stand up.

640
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,680
Yeah.

641
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,800
Alex also talks to Pete Santilli, who's a guy we've heard a couple of times on the show.

642
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,740
And I heard this and I was like, well, you are disqualified, sir.

643
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,960
So when my dad, when I got out of the Marine Corps, he gave me a sit down.

644
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:42,440
He was telling me how powerful the the Nazi, you know, a socialist movement was.

645
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:47,480
And he, in fact, and my dad is not a white supremacist, but he did describe to me historically,

646
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:52,840
he said it was so powerful that, you know, 99 percent of the people in Germany voted

647
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:58,240
for Hitler was the people that allowed Hitler to rise to power because of the trinkets that

648
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,240
they offer.

649
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,260
You know, of course, freebies for everyone schooling for everyone.

650
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:09,240
He said it was so powerful that it was the people that actually propelled Hitler to power.

651
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:13,240
Firstly, Hitler was very specifically not in favor of universal program.

652
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,640
No, absolutely not.

653
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,720
I'm sure that at no point was he out there advocating for free tuition for everyone,

654
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,360
maybe for Aryans or something, but not for everyone.

655
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,880
I mean, maybe later.

656
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,880
Yeah.

657
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,920
Second, this is an absolute fabrication and lie about how Hitler came to power.

658
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,320
It doesn't matter that this has nothing to do with reality.

659
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,600
This story doesn't exist to convey history and help people understand the world better.

660
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:39,600
The reason this story exists is to demonize social welfare programs, pure and simple.

661
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,480
Hitler didn't become chancellor because he and the Nazis offered everyone trinkets.

662
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:49,360
He'd run for president against Hindenburg in 1932 and he got 36.8% of the vote and afterwards

663
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:53,520
he was appointed chancellor as part of an attempt to create a coalition government that

664
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,520
would tamp down the Nazi movement from getting out of control, but more importantly, make

665
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,440
sure that the communists stayed far away from power.

666
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,440
Yeah.

667
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,440
Worked out.

668
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,320
By the time of the Reichstag fire and the enabling act, the only people in government

669
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:09,640
who were opposing Hitler were the left leaning social Democrats and probably the communists

670
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,280
would have, but they weren't in the Reichstag anymore.

671
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,280
Nope.

672
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,240
And Pete Santilli tells this story because he wants everyone listening to think that

673
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,140
if you have a politician talking about expanding Medicare or social security, the next thing

674
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,520
they're going to do is set up concentration camps.

675
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,520
It's total bullshit.

676
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,000
He's just against public spending.

677
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,400
That's like, it's just a desperate attempt to make that argument based on nothing.

678
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:37,440
And just one of the subtlest things in it is that 99% number of just like, it is easy

679
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:43,040
and it is right to demonize everyone that disagrees with you.

680
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,760
99% of them will be taken in by trinkets.

681
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,360
They're not even people smart enough to wake up.

682
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,600
They can't.

683
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,600
Trinkets are all they need.

684
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:56,360
So it's fine to obliterate them just like you wanted to the Nazis.

685
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,360
Yep.

686
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,360
Yep.

687
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,800
So anyway, fuck Pete Santilli too.

688
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:06,600
This emergency report really was about one thing for me.

689
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:11,280
I don't care about Alex's ideas that the January 6th is a false flag.

690
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,280
Yeah.

691
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,280
I don't care about Nick Fuentes.

692
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,280
No.

693
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,920
I don't care about Barnes and I don't care about Pete Santilli.

694
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,920
All of them.

695
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,040
I care about one thing.

696
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,040
Mike down.

697
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:24,160
Well, he's one of our most popular guests and he is back by demand.

698
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,640
Dr. Steve Puchenik is a best selling author.

699
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,640
Yes.

700
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,640
You're a witch.

701
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,480
You were saying last week we were talking after the show.

702
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,280
You were like, man, I've been, I'm missing Steve.

703
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,000
I've been needing a big swing.

704
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,560
But I also was saying that I feel Steve coming back.

705
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,560
He's coming.

706
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,640
It's around the corner.

707
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:51,880
Even when Alex and him had the falling out about his ridiculous predictions around the

708
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,280
election, I still was like, alright, he's on time out.

709
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,280
He'll be back.

710
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,280
He'll be back.

711
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,280
And here we are.

712
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,280
Here we are in June.

713
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,280
Steve is back.

714
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,240
So as far as the bet went.

715
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:07,680
He made the soft landing into Owen's show.

716
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,960
He started coming back on the war room a little bit and then that was the way to get the toe

717
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,960
in the water.

718
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,640
But the thing that I find really interesting about that clip is that Alex is like, by popular

719
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,600
demand, Steve Puchenik is back.

720
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,120
I think he might have gotten bullied into having Steve back on.

721
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,000
It does kind of seem like it.

722
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,560
And they let him go on Owen's show as like, hey, listen, if you can prove you can stay

723
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:31,200
on target on this show, then we'll give you that.

724
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,800
Or if it's not too humiliating.

725
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,800
Yeah, exactly.

726
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,240
It's so great.

727
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,040
What a fucking kid gloves.

728
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,440
He's too popular to get rid of completely, but I hate him so much.

729
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:46,480
I gotta say that if there were a guest that we had, like if we had guests and there was

730
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,960
a guest we had who was really, really popular, but also was a complete dick and was using

731
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,720
us and lying to everybody, I wouldn't care how popular they were.

732
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,960
They would not be on my show ever again.

733
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,960
No.

734
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:02,640
And if we had people being like, no, you got to have him back on the show, we'd be like,

735
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,960
we will not be having him back on the show.

736
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,960
End of conversation.

737
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,920
I mean, you should stop listening because you like that guy.

738
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,720
If you like it, goodbye.

739
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,720
Yeah.

740
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,720
Yeah.

741
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,200
What integrity Alex has.

742
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,360
He's just one of the heroes of our time.

743
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,560
Tip of the spear.

744
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,560
Undoubtedly.

745
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,560
Uh huh.

746
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:23,520
So Alex let Steve speak his piece and this to me is Steve declaring victory over Ithra

747
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,520
Wars.

748
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,720
It's always a pleasure, Alex.

749
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,520
Always remember you and I are the focus of the rage of the left and particularly when

750
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:35,660
you have what we call liberal fascism.

751
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:40,540
This is what you're beginning to see with the Biden administration, with Susan Rice,

752
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:44,120
with Obama, uh, Biden isn't running anything.

753
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,520
He had three aneurysm.

754
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,680
He's cognitively impaired.

755
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,440
There's a demand for him to take a test.

756
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,320
The real issue now is that we are in the midst of a military coup.

757
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,480
I said it to you a year and a half ago.

758
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,960
We were those watermark balance buddy computers.

759
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,660
We marked the balance.

760
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,420
We know exactly who's corrupt.

761
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:07,160
We know where the corruption is occurring and what you're seeing is the federal government

762
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,920
trying to hold on.

763
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:13,720
So now by popular demand, Alex has to have Steve back on and Steve isn't budging on the

764
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,720
watermark balance.

765
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,720
Nope.

766
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,720
Nope.

767
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,720
They made the bet.

768
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,880
He lost the bet and still going for it.

769
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,520
Well he's going to mold reality in such a way as to win the bet.

770
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,120
What an asshole.

771
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:31,340
What a, that, I mean, I can totally understand why Alex hates him.

772
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:38,520
Like on a deep level because that is a narcissistic psychopath fighting a narcissistic psychopath

773
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:42,080
and losing your reality to his.

774
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,080
That's brutal.

775
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:49,800
But one of the, like it's, it's two narcissistic psychopaths, but one is way better at manipulating

776
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,800
people.

777
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,800
Yeah.

778
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,800
Yeah.

779
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,800
Yeah.

780
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,800
He's a pro.

781
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,800
He's a real pro and Alex is an easy mark.

782
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,640
So you, you might have some doubts about watermark ballots.

783
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,280
I have plenty of them.

784
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,920
You should let those doubts go to bed.

785
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,920
Okay.

786
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,720
We've marked the computers.

787
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,960
We've marked the ballot.

788
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:12,980
We Steve crypto engraving and it was a sophisticated engraving.

789
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:19,680
This was a sting operation run by many of our military intelligence, civilian intelligence,

790
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:25,440
key selected PRI people who knew that we were having a corrupt government and they were

791
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,880
tired of war.

792
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,840
And we went on your show to basically pronounce that and make that announcement clear to the

793
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:39,960
American public because you became the one source that was reliable, valid, and important

794
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,240
to our institution.

795
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:49,980
I am going to say a bunch of shit directly to your face that you know is not true and

796
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,040
have told me is not true.

797
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:56,440
And then I'm going to compliment you for it at the end that went from compliment as a

798
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:02,720
way of buttering you up to compliment as the knife stuck deep into your gut and then twist

799
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,360
it around as a weapon.

800
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,360
Oh, that is good stuff.

801
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,360
Yeah.

802
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:12,260
Cause in order to stand up for your dignity, uh, disagreeing with the bullshit I'm saying,

803
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:16,560
you would have to disagree with the compliment praise God.

804
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,080
That's so evil.

805
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,580
That's evil.

806
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:20,580
That's just so good.

807
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:24,000
So Steve's got another prediction here and it's a, I don't, I don't think this is a good

808
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
one.

809
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,280
I think that the Democrats won't exist within a few months.

810
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,280
Oh, that'll be tough.

811
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:34,920
What you're seeing is the eruption of a party that will no longer exist within a few more

812
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:35,920
months.

813
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,720
They sound as if they're going to be successful, but they're not at all.

814
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:43,560
So I'll give them, I'll just to be generous to Steve, I'll give them till the end of the

815
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,560
year.

816
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:51,560
So the democratic party exists, but the beginning of 2022 Steve will once again be incorrect.

817
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:56,240
I mean, I'll say, I would say I have to, I'll, I'll stop it at about halfway through the

818
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,920
campaign season.

819
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,920
You know what I'm saying?

820
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:03,840
Whenever the democratic congressmen are still are going back for their next house of representatives,

821
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:08,240
the senators are up for, uh, that's past a few months.

822
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,120
Well, I'm, I'm trying to be as generous as possible.

823
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,360
I feel like given six months is pretty generous.

824
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,360
That's true.

825
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:19,440
But I mean, you know, you gotta at least see if the Democrats campaign before they're eradicated

826
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,440
completely.

827
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,440
Maybe they, yeah, I don't know.

828
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,920
This is all bullshit, but super bullshit.

829
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,440
So Alex has this big talking point that he throws out a bunch that Trump has come out

830
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,680
and he said, we're going to win back a Congress and maybe even the presidency before you,

831
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:36,240
before you expect it, you know, like, no, that's probably true.

832
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,560
Well, Alex asks Steve, why did Trump say that stuff?

833
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,720
And Steve's got an interesting answer.

834
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,440
What about the amazing statement by Trump two weeks ago where he said, we're going to

835
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,700
win the house, we're going to win the Senate and we're going to win the presidency a lot

836
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:53,240
sooner than you think, basically saying Joe Biden would be gone.

837
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:59,960
And now you see prestigious Democrat doctor saying he needs to step down, all the evidence

838
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:02,880
of election fraud and the proof coming out.

839
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,320
And I look at the body language of Garland and of others.

840
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,140
They look like deer in the headlights.

841
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:13,100
So can you lay out for us what you thought was going to happen on January six versus

842
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:17,900
what's happened, but what's then now unfolding right now and what, what do you think Trump's

843
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,560
cryptic statement meant?

844
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:26,220
What Trump's statement meant was simply to say that he knew and was aware in part talk

845
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:32,480
of the fact that we in the military and in the intelligence community selected a certain

846
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,440
number of people to be involved in what we call the sting operation, where we put water

847
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:43,880
marks and encrypted code on the machines, the voting machines and all the ballots.

848
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,140
So Trump is in on it.

849
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:46,680
That is so good.

850
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,680
That is so good.

851
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:53,160
Alex gave him that subtle, like what you thought back then.

852
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:57,520
Tell us what you think now as though they were going to be different.

853
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,520
Nope.

854
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,520
Nope.

855
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,520
Same bullshit.

856
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,520
Yeah.

857
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:06,520
Alex is also giving some signal to like, Hey, you know, they, uh, it turns out you maybe

858
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,520
were right about all that stuff.

859
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,520
Maybe I was wrong.

860
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,520
Yeah.

861
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,000
Like that's such a sub they're submitting.

862
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Yeah.

863
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Yeah.

864
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Yep.

865
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Yep.

866
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Yeah.

867
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Yeah.

868
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,320
One of the, one of the things that might come into your mind is like, okay, so they ran

869
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,320
this big sting operation.

870
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,600
Obviously there's going to be some guilty parties.

871
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,600
Sure.

872
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,600
I got it.

873
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,600
Yeah.

874
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,600
Somebody has got to be in prison, right?

875
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:30,600
Secret indictments.

876
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:35,880
Well then what we call the sting operation where we put watermarks and encrypted code

877
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:40,640
on the machines, the voting machines and all the ballots in the process.

878
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:45,800
We understood that there would be a lot of people implicated, indicted and convicted

879
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:51,160
and sent not to the prisons in America, but to our prisons in Guantanamo.

880
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:56,840
We built a whole new facility a year ago using new wiring, not in the old Guantanamo, but

881
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,480
in the mountains of Guantanamo.

882
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:03,840
Many of these people have been sent down without any notice to anybody else.

883
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:04,840
What?

884
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,840
Yeah.

885
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,980
So apparently a bunch of people are secretly in Guantanamo now.

886
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:10,080
So this is just QAnon stuff.

887
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,380
There's a bunch of white collar bureaucrats.

888
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:17,880
They forced to go to a mountain stronghold prison in Guantanamo?

889
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:18,880
And probably the Pope.

890
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,480
And probably the real Pope.

891
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,480
Yeah.

892
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,480
That's probably true.

893
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,480
Oh man.

894
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,480
Yep.

895
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,480
I don't want to go to that prison.

896
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,480
No.

897
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,480
No, that sounds terrible.

898
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:32,200
So Steve gets talking about January 6th and essentially what it is is a Pelosi Merrick

899
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,440
Garland false flag or something.

900
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,540
Just doesn't sound true.

901
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:40,820
It's not, but what's more important, listen to Steve spin his wheels while trying to describe

902
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:41,820
Merrick Garland.

903
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:46,880
Mike down for this, I really want you to pay attention to this cause it's, it's outrageous.

904
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:53,600
And this is once again, Nancy Pelosi agreeing to have this type of false flag using another

905
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:58,820
one of our Washington based quote, attorney generals Garland.

906
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:02,640
It's a full Garland went to a school called Andover.

907
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:09,420
He was a little prep school from a wasp family in New York, then went to Yale and then went

908
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:17,540
to a prestigious law firm where he only earned a $9 million in one case and is worth between

909
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:22,180
about 16 million to 24 million.

910
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:27,440
Never having served our country, never having built a business, never having to take a risk

911
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,340
like you and I have.

912
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,500
So basic, Oh, Garland, I'm sorry.

913
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:32,700
It's the Jewish guy.

914
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:33,700
It's the other guy.

915
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:35,540
Uh, no, that's, yeah.

916
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:41,120
He's the Jewish guy who also went ironically to Harvard, also went to Harvard undergraduate

917
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,680
of Harvard, the, uh, law school.

918
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,620
Steve got the memorized bio for Merrick Garland wrong.

919
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:47,620
Yeah.

920
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:50,060
I was going to say that doesn't sound right at all.

921
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:54,780
No, he's just, yeah, I mean he has these like little bits of a little information that he's

922
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:56,900
memorized about folks to throw out.

923
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:01,420
But you also notice that like the things that he sort of hinges on are like, he's a wasp,

924
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:02,620
he's a Jewish guy.

925
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:03,620
Like weird.

926
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:04,620
Yep.

927
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:09,980
You got to know what people are before you can build an opinion about them, Dan.

928
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:10,980
That makes perfect sense.

929
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:11,980
Seems to be what Steve.

930
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:16,580
That's what Steve believes and uh, that's cause he's a giant fucking white nationalist

931
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:17,580
racist.

932
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:18,580
Boy.

933
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,580
Yeah.

934
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:20,580
And scary.

935
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:21,580
Like terrifying.

936
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:24,420
If he actually believes the things that he's saying, he is so scary.

937
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:28,860
He is, he is, he, Oh God, people should be chasing him with butterfly nets.

938
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:30,500
No, no, absolutely.

939
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:33,580
He should be in a Hannibal Lecter mask 100%.

940
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:34,580
Yeah.

941
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:39,540
So Steve gets to talking about how the Democrats are done, but shows the GOP because Trump

942
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:42,380
has now created a new, better party.

943
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:45,860
And his reasoning for this is strange.

944
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:51,140
What you're seeing is the end of a political party, the so-called Democrats.

945
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:58,300
In turn, we will end the Republican party as we know it because Trump came in as a black

946
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:01,220
sheep in the dynamics of politics.

947
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:08,340
In other words, he was so far out that we, the people understood that we needed a businessman

948
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:14,700
to come in and no longer politician as Vladimir Putin said it correctly when he saw Biden

949
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:19,620
or if he did see Biden, he said, look, Biden is nothing more than the political hack who's

950
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:22,400
been around for 43 years.

951
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:30,700
What I need is a man who has character, personality, and is able to take the risks that I, Putin

952
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:33,620
have taken before in running Russia.

953
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:37,580
So yeah, apparently Biden's a bad president because Putin doesn't like him.

954
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:45,860
You know, it's really weird in 2021 to listen to just out and out fascists talk, fascistly,

955
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:50,820
you know, where you're like, I don't remember people being so openly fascist back in the

956
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:51,820
day.

957
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:55,920
Maybe I just wasn't paying attention, but as a kid, I don't remember like just hearing

958
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,140
all these fascist talk all the fascist time.

959
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:04,220
I do feel like this is more overt than even, I remember some of the really fascist.

960
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:05,220
Yeah.

961
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:09,420
I mean, and, and like just even on, you know, putting that aside, think about how overt

962
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:15,220
like this conversation about an ongoing military coup to overthrow the government is like,

963
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:16,740
and banal too.

964
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:21,100
Steve is almost sort of like gleefully just discussing like, ah, we're, we're overthrowing

965
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,100
the government.

966
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:23,660
It's all over this point.

967
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:29,020
We're basically cleaning out what I call the lavage of 21.

968
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:36,900
This is a political lavage of America, both Republicans and Democrats explain what a political

969
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:43,260
lavage is for those of us that didn't live in France.

970
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:45,960
A political lavage basic.

971
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:51,540
I'm using a fancy term that I created to make sure that the American people understands

972
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:54,900
we're basically cleaning out the system.

973
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:59,360
An alternative term for that was a coup or regime change.

974
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:04,940
When I came on your show and I explained that I had the right to say publicly that we were

975
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:10,980
in the midst and the beginning of a military coup, which was a sting operation, I wasn't

976
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:15,100
coming to the forefront and saying something that I wasn't allowed to say.

977
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,100
Yeah.

978
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:23,440
I mean, he's got a lavage going on or if you don't know what Steve's own made up political

979
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,820
term is, it's a coup.

980
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:31,580
I was going to say coup, but I said a different word to make everybody think that I'm super

981
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:37,420
smart, but instead I just made up a term, which makes me look like a complete asshole.

982
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:38,420
Yeah.

983
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:42,900
I mean, you know, he's got an ongoing military coup on his hands and that seems like a lot.

984
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,100
That seems like a lot.

985
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:48,060
But Steve's team, they're in deep.

986
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:49,060
They're everywhere.

987
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:51,340
It does seem like that, dude.

988
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:53,020
This is a big revelation.

989
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:56,860
If true, which it's not, this is a huge deal.

990
00:52:56,860 --> 00:53:05,100
We in the, uh, well, we outside the administration, some of them are famous generals, uh, Keith

991
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:07,300
Alexander's one he's on Amazon.

992
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,680
We threw out Bezos.

993
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,880
He's head of the chairman of the board at what?

994
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:18,100
But the reason we took over Amazon was we wanted a cloud, a civilian clown, the largest

995
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:19,100
cloud.

996
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:23,660
In turn, we placed in a four star general Nakasone third generation nice side.

997
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,620
You are out of your fucking mind.

998
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:26,620
Front.

999
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,340
He was in cyber command.

1000
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:31,000
We put him into the white house.

1001
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:38,040
So what we did was to take over this administration and allow it to play out in a car in their

1002
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:46,140
own corruption, in their own, uh, miscreant, uh, a way, because we knew that everything

1003
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:52,380
they were about to do would be either ignorant, corrupt, and dangerous to the United States.

1004
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:54,300
Well, let me tell you what that's crazy.

1005
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:55,300
What you're saying?

1006
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:59,180
ZZ won't even talk to Biden or any administration.

1007
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:00,180
They won't even talk to him.

1008
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:01,180
Like they're scared.

1009
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:02,620
Like they know it's a trap.

1010
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:08,360
Steve has a little team and they've taken over Amazon and the government.

1011
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,360
It's amazing.

1012
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,340
This is, that's a big swing.

1013
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:12,340
Yeah.

1014
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:13,340
Oh yeah.

1015
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:14,340
That's a big swing.

1016
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:19,660
You know, you come to Steve for a big swing and we overthrew Amazon first, not the swing

1017
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:21,240
I was expecting, but that's a big one.

1018
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,280
They needed the cloud.

1019
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,460
That biggest company in the world thing.

1020
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:26,060
We stole it.

1021
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:27,620
We commandeered it.

1022
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:30,420
Bezos, get out of here.

1023
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:35,820
If Alex took that seriously for a fucking second, he would have to be like, all right,

1024
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:38,860
Steve, fix all that shit that I complain about Amazon all the time.

1025
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:39,860
Totally.

1026
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:40,860
Totally.

1027
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:41,860
Why then?

1028
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:42,860
Why aren't you guys doing anything right?

1029
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:43,860
Yeah.

1030
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:45,460
You're military owned now or whatever.

1031
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:46,460
Nonsense.

1032
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:47,460
Yeah.

1033
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:51,780
Um, so one of the things that Steve wants you to know though is like, okay, so like,

1034
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:56,180
look, there's, there appear to be some frosty relations between Biden and China.

1035
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:57,180
Sure.

1036
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:58,180
Right?

1037
00:54:58,180 --> 00:54:59,180
Yeah.

1038
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:00,180
Doesn't seem like things are maybe as amicable.

1039
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,180
It's fine.

1040
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:02,180
Not great.

1041
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:03,180
Yeah.

1042
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:04,180
But what?

1043
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:05,180
It's fine.

1044
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:06,180
Okay.

1045
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:07,180
It's fine.

1046
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:08,180
Well that's good.

1047
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:09,180
Because Steve talked to China.

1048
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,180
No, no, no, no, no.

1049
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:16,500
But the key point here was that Gigi ping understood that Biden was not in control.

1050
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:21,680
I had sent him a message with the approval of my people a year and a half ago that this

1051
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,740
was not relevant to China.

1052
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:26,940
We would remain, remain friends of China.

1053
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:32,700
At the same time, we sent a message to Modi of India to say, we are your friends as well.

1054
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:33,700
Yeah.

1055
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:37,020
So Steve's in touch with, uh, uh, she and, uh, Modi.

1056
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:38,020
Wow.

1057
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:41,900
I feel like Steve is more involved now than he was in the past.

1058
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:42,900
Oh yeah.

1059
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:47,940
I feel like now Steve has gone from being like, I'm part of an operation to being like,

1060
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,740
I'm running this shit.

1061
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:53,740
I think, I think it's an escalation that comes with knowing that you're untouchable.

1062
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:54,740
Yeah.

1063
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:55,740
Yeah.

1064
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:56,740
Yeah.

1065
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:57,740
You're untouchable.

1066
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:02,700
So why not go ahead and create yourself as like this arch super villain slash hero, I

1067
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:05,500
guess, depending on perspective, why not?

1068
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:09,760
And he's using we and you think he's, he's talking about his team, but part of me is

1069
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:14,860
like, we're at the Royal we level of him describing himself, you know, at this point you can get

1070
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:16,260
away with whatever you want.

1071
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:20,620
You've got Alex basically dead to rights on everything.

1072
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:23,700
You can just, he's not going to put up a fight about anything.

1073
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:28,020
He fired David Knight, kicked you off the show for a few months and now he's forced

1074
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:29,020
to have you back.

1075
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,020
Ooh.

1076
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:31,020
Like you could get away with whatever you want.

1077
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,020
Why not?

1078
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:33,020
Just legend build.

1079
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:34,020
Yeah.

1080
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:35,500
Alex passed a yes and you.

1081
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:36,500
Oh man.

1082
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,660
But Jesus, this is so big.

1083
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:41,500
I control all the levers of power in the world.

1084
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:45,700
I told, I told China put up with Biden.

1085
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:46,700
It's cool.

1086
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:51,080
You know, like there's that big lie theory that he's operating on with Alex now.

1087
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,080
This is too big.

1088
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,620
This is too big of a lie.

1089
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:55,160
This is just too big.

1090
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:58,100
But I did notice there that he pronounced it Gigi ping.

1091
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:59,100
Yes.

1092
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:01,180
And that makes me think that that's why Alex pronounces it that way.

1093
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:02,180
That would make sense.

1094
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:03,180
Probably from talking to Steve.

1095
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:04,540
Too much.

1096
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:07,980
Which is how much anybody who ever speaks to Steve talks to Steve.

1097
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:08,980
Sure.

1098
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:09,980
Yeah.

1099
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:10,980
Don't talk to that dude.

1100
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:11,980
Don't talk to him.

1101
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:12,980
Just don't talk to him.

1102
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:15,780
So Steve was talking about how like they've taken over Amazon and they also took over

1103
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:19,740
the government and they took over the Biden administration essentially in order to let

1104
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:21,940
it play out its corrupt ways.

1105
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:22,940
Sure.

1106
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:26,540
And that's because they wanted to show the world that this is all corrupt.

1107
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:27,540
Right?

1108
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:28,540
Yeah.

1109
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:29,540
So they had to let it happen.

1110
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:30,540
See.

1111
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:31,540
That's a bad plan.

1112
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:32,540
If Trump had won.

1113
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:33,540
Right.

1114
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:37,660
Then, you know, maybe you get a little bit done, but if Trump loses, it shows how corrupt

1115
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:38,660
everything is.

1116
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:39,660
Right.

1117
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:40,660
You get even more done.

1118
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:41,660
Right.

1119
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:42,660
It's, it's brilliant.

1120
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:43,660
No, that's a bad plan.

1121
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:44,660
Brilliant.

1122
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:45,660
No, that's a bad plan.

1123
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:46,660
Brilliant.

1124
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:47,660
I know you think you're playing the long game, but that's a bad plan.

1125
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:48,660
It's brilliant.

1126
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:49,660
All right.

1127
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:50,660
Well, we'll see.

1128
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:51,660
And that's all Trump was trying to do, man.

1129
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:52,660
Okay.

1130
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:54,180
I mean, it shows the world that things weren't good.

1131
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:55,700
That doesn't sound true.

1132
00:57:55,700 --> 00:58:02,100
What happens is you enter self-destruction and that's what Washington was all about.

1133
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:05,180
And that's what Trump was trying to show the people.

1134
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:09,900
And those of us who worked in Washington, but no longer live there, trying to show the

1135
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:17,900
American people how incompetent, corrupt, and disgraceful these, uh, these people, politicians

1136
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:23,940
were the Mitt Romney, a Mormon from Utah, yet he was a governor of Massachusetts.

1137
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:24,940
Now he's a Senator.

1138
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:25,940
No, no, no.

1139
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:27,520
Undoubtedly, they're all incompetent.

1140
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:33,700
Here's what I'm asking you is listen, a blind hog gets eggers twice a day, broken clocks

1141
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:35,140
are right twice a day.

1142
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:36,780
I love hearing all this confidence.

1143
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:39,820
It's wonderful for radio TV.

1144
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:45,660
They're now saying there are secret watermarks, 3d holograms on the ballots.

1145
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:48,020
And now I see certified experts.

1146
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:49,020
It's true.

1147
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:50,020
They're not.

1148
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:51,020
Oh no, Alex.

1149
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:52,020
Oh man.

1150
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:53,020
Oh, you loser.

1151
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:54,020
Oh, see, this is what I'm saying.

1152
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:58,420
Don't you dare tell me that Alex could help overthrow the fucking Capitol.

1153
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:02,420
Steve Pagenik made him turn into a little baby dog.

1154
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:03,420
Pathetic.

1155
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:08,500
Steve, Alex could actually help a fake overthrow of the government.

1156
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,500
Totally.

1157
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,500
Yeah.

1158
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:11,500
No, it'd be great.

1159
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:12,500
In the war of the world's radio play.

1160
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:13,500
Right.

1161
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:14,500
Right.

1162
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,500
Right.

1163
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:16,500
Right.

1164
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:17,500
This is a little silly.

1165
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:21,300
So Steve wants you to know that the, this is really actually a good thing that's going

1166
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:22,300
on.

1167
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:28,380
The intelligence community, it's all getting cleansed and Alex is like, he's all worried

1168
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:30,780
for his own safety and Steve's like, you're fine.

1169
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:31,780
Of course.

1170
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:32,780
You're fine.

1171
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:33,780
Of course.

1172
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:37,100
This is far more of a cleansing than anybody realizes.

1173
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:38,460
Will you be harmed?

1174
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:39,460
No.

1175
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:40,740
Are they dangerous?

1176
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:41,740
Could be.

1177
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:43,140
Will they hurt you?

1178
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:44,140
No.

1179
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:47,940
Will Obama come back and write another nonsensical book?

1180
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:48,940
Yes.

1181
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:49,940
That's what they gave them.

1182
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:50,940
What is happening?

1183
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:53,820
He was brought on Netflix, a dying Institute.

1184
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:55,420
What happened in the process?

1185
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:56,780
Hollywood went under.

1186
00:59:56,780 --> 01:00:02,180
I mean, I guess he does own Amazon prime 18 years ago, this would all happen.

1187
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:03,180
We've got to find those interviews.

1188
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:04,180
You've been dead, right?

1189
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:05,180
So I get what you're saying.

1190
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:06,180
Yeah.

1191
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:07,180
You got to find those interviews.

1192
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:08,180
Yeah.

1193
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:09,180
Yeah.

1194
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:10,180
Find those interviews.

1195
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:11,180
Find those interviews.

1196
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:12,180
I would like you to find those interviews.

1197
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:15,060
I love that self interview of like, are they going to hurt you?

1198
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:16,060
No.

1199
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:17,060
Are they dangerous?

1200
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:18,060
Maybe.

1201
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:19,060
But are they going to hurt you?

1202
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:20,060
No.

1203
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:21,060
Is Obama going to write another dumb book?

1204
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:22,060
You bet.

1205
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:23,060
Wow.

1206
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:25,620
What an infuriating way of talking to me.

1207
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:26,620
You asshole.

1208
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:27,620
Yeah.

1209
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:30,620
He put it out on Netflix, a dying entity.

1210
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:31,620
What?

1211
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:32,620
What?

1212
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:33,620
Netflix seems to be doing all right.

1213
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:34,620
Netflix is doing fine.

1214
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:35,620
We're not.

1215
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:36,620
I don't care.

1216
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:37,620
Why does that happen?

1217
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:38,620
Ugh.

1218
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:42,340
Do you think that that's an annoying way for someone to speak?

1219
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:43,340
Do I?

1220
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:44,340
Yes.

1221
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,340
Is it going to continue?

1222
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:46,340
Probably.

1223
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:47,340
Am I worried?

1224
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:48,340
No.

1225
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:55,140
I would say that you need to show some goddamn respect because this man single handedly.

1226
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:56,140
Don't tell me.

1227
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:57,140
He took down the Soviet Union.

1228
01:00:57,140 --> 01:00:58,140
No.

1229
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:04,440
Years ago on your show, and maybe this was before I was on your show, 1980s, I was involved

1230
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,660
in the takedown of the Soviet Union.

1231
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:10,980
Not me, just a group of us involved, both CIA, military.

1232
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:15,620
We took it down without any force or kinetic action.

1233
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:18,580
What happened is we made a little mistake.

1234
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:24,120
Instead of picking someone like Putin, we decided, and that was my fault, to have somebody

1235
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:28,340
who was rational, open-minded, and we picked Gorbachev.

1236
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:30,660
Look, Gorbachev is on me, guys.

1237
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:37,900
I cannot believe how magnanimous he is being with admitting guilt for a thing he could

1238
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:41,160
not have been less involved in.

1239
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:47,260
In the physical universe we inhabit, anything that he has ever done had zero effect.

1240
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:50,420
Me and my boys, we took down the Soviet Union, and then, look, we fucked up.

1241
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:51,420
Don't just say that to me.

1242
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:52,420
We fucked up.

1243
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:58,620
We put in Gorbachev and should have gone with a dictator right from the start.

1244
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:02,860
I do like that strategy of admitting fault for something that you absolutely did not

1245
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:03,860
do.

1246
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:07,860
It's disarming in a certain way.

1247
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:12,140
Try that at work the next time, whenever they're like, hey, you have been doing a tech... Listen,

1248
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:14,340
I'm really sorry.

1249
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:19,240
I thought it would be a good idea to overthrow the human resources department, and I installed

1250
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:21,120
the current head, and that's on me.

1251
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:24,260
That's on me right now, and they're like, what?

1252
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:26,140
Do you have a part of the hiring process?

1253
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:27,140
What's happening?

1254
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:33,260
Well, little do you know, I have been pulling the strings on all capitalist enterprises

1255
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:35,260
since the beginning of time.

1256
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:38,460
I invented investing.

1257
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:44,180
Just swing... Hey, have you ever seen Undercover Boss and then take your beard off?

1258
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:47,180
I invented the chair.

1259
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:48,180
What?

1260
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:51,300
Oh, my God.

1261
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,940
You know, before I came along, there wasn't photosynthesis.

1262
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:54,940
What?

1263
01:02:54,940 --> 01:03:01,580
I just can't... Steve Pajetik, man, that dude.

1264
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:06,580
There's a disease there, but I don't know which, what, or how bad it is, but it's bad.

1265
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:11,180
What's so amazing about him is that I feel this way about Alex, too, is there will never

1266
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:12,180
be another.

1267
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:13,180
No, no.

1268
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:18,200
There won't be another Alex, because he came along at this perfect time in the era of public

1269
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:25,660
access TV and right wing radio becoming ascendant, right when his career was taking an upward

1270
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:26,660
tick.

1271
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:32,660
Then he had this established career at the point when new media was really becoming a

1272
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:38,060
thing and social media, and so he had some credibility that other people lacked when

1273
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:42,220
information became so easily disseminated.

1274
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:45,320
Steve Pajetik is a guy who's nuts.

1275
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:49,900
He is one of the most fun liars I think I've ever heard.

1276
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:50,900
Just spectacular.

1277
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:54,100
But he also did work at the State Department.

1278
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:55,100
Wild.

1279
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:58,780
He did, he was involved in Aldo Moro's death.

1280
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:02,000
These are things that are, they are just real.

1281
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,380
They did happen.

1282
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:08,380
All these other dicks who come around, people who are on Project Camelot, they're just making

1283
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:09,700
up everything.

1284
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:14,500
Steve's making up a lot, but he also has that veneer of credibility that comes from what

1285
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:19,620
he was doing in the 70s, but I don't know if anyone will ever be able to replicate that.

1286
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:25,100
If you want to put together good credibility in this space, you need one tiny acorn of

1287
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:31,240
truth about you, and that will unlock your oak tree of bullshit, but you gotta have the

1288
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,240
acorn.

1289
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:36,940
You gotta have the acorn, and then if you want to be like Steve, you've gotta be naturally

1290
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:41,760
gifted at spinning these yarns and memorizing facts.

1291
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:47,180
Or have a rare delusional disorder that allows you to think these things as though they were

1292
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:49,060
true and say them confidently.

1293
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:54,580
And then at the same time, Steve wouldn't be able to work without Alex.

1294
01:04:54,580 --> 01:05:01,120
I've heard him on other shows, he was on Coast to Coast a couple times, it's not the same.

1295
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:06,540
You need that Alex straight man that you can just steamroll.

1296
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:11,980
You need to be able to flatter someone into giving you so much fucking leash that essentially

1297
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:12,980
it's gone.

1298
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:13,980
Until it is gone.

1299
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:15,060
I own Amazon.

1300
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:17,140
And then you are on a leash.

1301
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:18,140
That's what happened.

1302
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:22,460
He was like, okay, we're gonna keep, look, Dr. Steve can go out of pocket, we're gonna

1303
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:25,500
keep him close, but we're gonna keep him on a leash.

1304
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:30,100
And then all of a sudden, Alex is wearing that dog collar like, I don't know what happened.

1305
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:32,940
Yep, that is exactly what happened.

1306
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:40,860
So back to the narrative at hand, Steve took down the Soviet Union, accidentally put in

1307
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:41,860
Gorbachev.

1308
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:44,740
Or it was intentional then, but in hindsight, not a great decision.

1309
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:49,220
I mean, I think ultimately he should still be proud of that decision.

1310
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:51,060
Putin wasn't ready yet, man.

1311
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:52,060
That's the real issue.

1312
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:53,060
That's probably true.

1313
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:57,460
If it weren't for Gorbachev, if you hadn't have revealed the corruption in the system,

1314
01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:59,540
you never would have gotten Putin in the first place.

1315
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:01,620
See, it's playing out all over again.

1316
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:02,620
History rhymes, Dan.

1317
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:07,020
Well, interestingly, Steve is the kind of guy who likes to clean up his own messes.

1318
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:08,020
Wow, that's nice.

1319
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:12,140
So, you know, he put in Gorbachev, it wasn't a good idea, but he fixed that.

1320
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:13,140
Okay.

1321
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:17,340
Gorbachev was not strong enough to control 11 time zones.

1322
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:20,680
So at that time, the Soviet Union was 14 time zones.

1323
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:28,020
So we picked, I reconstructed that mistake and I picked a man who worked for Andropov,

1324
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:31,180
the head of KGB named Vladimir Putin.

1325
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:33,260
Putin knows he was picked by me.

1326
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:37,460
He was specifically picked because he was East German intelligence.

1327
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:38,520
He spoke English.

1328
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:39,620
He spoke German.

1329
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:40,620
He spoke Russian.

1330
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:41,620
Yep.

1331
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:46,100
So apparently Steve handpicked Vladimir Putin to take over for Gorbachev to fix his mistake

1332
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:49,080
from after he overthrew the Soviet Union.

1333
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:56,140
And Putin knows that Steve Puchenik was the one who was behind his rising to power.

1334
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:59,020
Oh boy.

1335
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:01,580
Outrageous.

1336
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:10,860
Hey, Alex, just so you know, Putin owes it all to me.

1337
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,580
It's all me, Alex.

1338
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:16,260
Everything inside your entire career.

1339
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:17,260
That's me.

1340
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:23,140
And I can guide international relations by sending a message to China or India.

1341
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:25,540
Everybody just waits on my beck and call.

1342
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:30,140
Alex, listen, if you fuck with me, there's nowhere I can't find you.

1343
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:32,100
I can find you in the North.

1344
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:33,940
I can find you in the South.

1345
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:36,140
I can find you around the world.

1346
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:38,020
28 time zones.

1347
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:41,060
That's how many time zones I can find you in.

1348
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:42,340
Steve's never that animated.

1349
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:44,540
I know, but it'd be more fun.

1350
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:47,620
My character I think is a little bit of a nice addition.

1351
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:48,620
Yeah, I guess.

1352
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:54,900
I mean, I feel like Steve's, but Steve's menace is far more dry.

1353
01:07:54,900 --> 01:08:01,340
You know, when there was the hurricane and he was scolding Alex about his manners, it

1354
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:03,500
was more terrifying that he didn't yell at him.

1355
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:09,540
He was just like, wow, my neighbor's house is underwater right now and you're being a

1356
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:11,540
dick to me.

1357
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:12,540
That's scary.

1358
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:17,820
Yeah, yeah, he does have that cool level headed malevolence about him.

1359
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:18,820
That's a big feature.

1360
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:25,900
Yeah, so one of the clips that we found early on in our time doing the show was something

1361
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:32,140
that kind of shocked us, I believe, and it was the clip where Alex talks about going

1362
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:41,140
on RT and he gets debriefed by Russian intelligence and that was a bizarre clip and it's not something

1363
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:44,420
that we've heard a ton more from Alex about.

1364
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:48,660
We're going to have to find those Steve Pacenik clips from 18 years ago.

1365
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:55,360
So when Alex talked about that clip, or when he talked about that experience the first

1366
01:08:55,360 --> 01:09:00,980
time we heard it, it was the story of the Russians being like, you know so much, you're

1367
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:03,600
brilliant, you know all this, it was all about Alex.

1368
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:04,600
He's too brilliant.

1369
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:05,900
The story's a little different now.

1370
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:06,900
Oh is it?

1371
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:07,900
Alex tells it again.

1372
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:08,900
Oh.

1373
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:09,900
Kind of a different focus.

1374
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:10,900
Odd.

1375
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:14,180
The last time I was on Russian TV, this was probably about 10 years ago, 8, 9 years ago,

1376
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:18,780
they go, listen, we got this group wants to talk to you, it's this Russian national TV,

1377
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:20,660
we want you on.

1378
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:25,220
So I'm sitting there on Skype out of my office and it's this big boardroom and there's all

1379
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:29,740
these guys with beards, this is obviously not TV, and it's like all the big brain bugs

1380
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:34,200
their intelligence agents, they're all looking at me and they go, tell us about Pacenik.

1381
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,820
How do you know Pacenik?

1382
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:37,060
What do you know about Pacenik?

1383
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:38,900
What do you think of Putin and Pacenik?

1384
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:43,760
And they were, I remember like, I'm not an intelligence operative, I'm a talk show host,

1385
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:47,140
but definitely they had been sent by Putin to ask about you.

1386
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:49,900
They kept like, and I just said, I don't know anything about Pacenik.

1387
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:53,960
He's an author, I've had him on, he used to work for U.S. intelligence agencies, but that's

1388
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:58,860
a true story because it's a boardroom of like 15 dudes and like these are the Russians you

1389
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:03,100
see on TV, these are like the brain bugs, you know, like they're just like totally asking

1390
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:04,100
about you.

1391
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:05,100
Like from Starship Troopers.

1392
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:06,100
That actually happened.

1393
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:07,100
Yeah, that actually happened.

1394
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:08,100
That 100% actually happened.

1395
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:11,180
Yeah, so now the story is, they were thrilling him about Pacenik.

1396
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:14,580
Just because I've changed the story multiple times doesn't mean it didn't totally happen.

1397
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:20,940
Well, and it's certainly like what would happen if Pacenik is single-handedly responsible

1398
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:25,540
for USSR Russian history over the last decades.

1399
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:32,120
Yeah, yeah, it does seem like if he was the one who both overthrew the Soviet Union, installed

1400
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:39,380
multiple prime ministers, and so on and so forth, I don't even think that the RT guys,

1401
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:41,340
unless it was a splinter group.

1402
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:42,340
It would have to be.

1403
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:43,340
It would have to be.

1404
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:44,980
That's the only reason they would be asking about Steve, right?

1405
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:45,980
Right.

1406
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:47,900
It wouldn't be, because Steve would get the phone call if it was-

1407
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:48,900
From Putin.

1408
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:49,900
From Putin.

1409
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:50,900
He'd be like, hey.

1410
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:51,900
Yeah, exactly.

1411
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:52,900
It would be too easy.

1412
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:57,220
So now we've got a revolutionary group within the Soviet Union, or within the remnants of

1413
01:10:57,220 --> 01:11:04,060
the Soviet Union, coming back to find out dirt on Steve so they can take him out because

1414
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:07,080
he's too powerful.

1415
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:08,220
Or it didn't happen.

1416
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:09,780
That would also be likely.

1417
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:10,780
Yeah.

1418
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:17,980
Or Alex got interviewed on Russian TV, and he was asked a question that sounded weird,

1419
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:21,220
and it became spycraft.

1420
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:26,900
Or he went on a show that did a pre-interview.

1421
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:28,500
You seem to talk to Steve Pacenik a lot.

1422
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:29,500
He's crazy, right?

1423
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:32,980
With the writer's room.

1424
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:38,660
So Steve, his big thing is that Biden's going to be gone soon.

1425
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:42,700
Although the way he talks about it is a little bit off-putting.

1426
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:44,660
Biden will no longer be president.

1427
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:47,380
Blinken will not be Secretary of State.

1428
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:52,500
You will not have all these American Jewish guys who never served our country.

1429
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:55,120
25 of them remain in power.

1430
01:11:55,120 --> 01:12:01,140
At the same time, Trump will have to have a whole new backup system, not with the people

1431
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:02,140
he had.

1432
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:03,700
Donald Trump has to go.

1433
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:04,700
Why?

1434
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:05,700
Trump has to go.

1435
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:07,900
Yeah, it seems real strange.

1436
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:09,700
I mean, not strange at all, but...

1437
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:11,660
No, that's vicious anti-Semitism.

1438
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:18,460
He seems very strongly focused on defining people by their religion or heritage.

1439
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:20,300
It's not good.

1440
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:26,140
There are very easy visual ways to disqualify people as humans in Steve Pacenik's world.

1441
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:27,140
Yeah.

1442
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:28,140
Yikes.

1443
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:29,140
Not good.

1444
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:30,140
Nope.

1445
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:36,220
It's like, Steve, our interview is about to come to an end, but I got to ask you.

1446
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:38,660
You saying that Biden's going to go down.

1447
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:39,660
Give me a timeframe.

1448
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:41,540
Oh, give me a timeframe, Steve.

1449
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:42,540
Make me another bet.

1450
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:43,540
I understand.

1451
01:12:43,540 --> 01:12:47,420
So in closing, you're going to come back again soon, StevePacenik.com, found all your interesting

1452
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:48,600
work there.

1453
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:52,880
In closing, though, what is the timeframe on Biden?

1454
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:57,200
I will not give you a timeframe because the last timeframe was not accurate.

1455
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:04,060
So let us just say in time, with patience, you will see this evolution that we're talking

1456
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:05,060
about.

1457
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:06,740
Oh, listen, they know that evolution's there.

1458
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:08,380
That's why they're going to come after everybody.

1459
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:09,380
Okay.

1460
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:12,780
All right, Alex, convince yourself that this guy isn't fucking with you.

1461
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:15,800
So I admit I got the math wrong.

1462
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:21,220
The end of the world is not on December 21st, 2021.

1463
01:13:21,220 --> 01:13:24,280
It's going to be on December 21st.

1464
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:30,140
Doesn't sound anything like 2021, so it'll be there.

1465
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:35,580
This is so awesome and so frustrating and so funny.

1466
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:41,260
I can't imagine how little dignity one must have to allow Steve back on the show.

1467
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:42,260
It's sad.

1468
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:46,880
It's embarrassing to a level that I would have thought Alex would be above.

1469
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:52,220
He has such an ego to him that I would have thought for sure he'd be like, Steve fucked

1470
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:53,220
me.

1471
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:56,260
Because around the election, that was unacceptable.

1472
01:13:56,260 --> 01:14:00,500
There's no way, if I let him back on the show, it's going to look so bad.

1473
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:01,500
Yep.

1474
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:02,500
Doesn't care.

1475
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:03,500
Steve's back.

1476
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:06,460
Steve's back and Alex is making excuses for why maybe Steve's actually right.

1477
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:07,460
Yeah.

1478
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:08,860
I mean, I heard it in his voice.

1479
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:14,220
I heard that there was a certain despondence in his voice that I felt like was definitely

1480
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:15,220
there.

1481
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:16,220
Maybe.

1482
01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:22,720
A little bit of disappointment, maybe a little bit of like, just a small smidge of what have

1483
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:23,720
I become?

1484
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:28,740
I feel, I felt a small, like when he was like, yeah, that's what they're talking about.

1485
01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:30,780
I feel a small smidge of it.

1486
01:14:30,780 --> 01:14:34,700
These are human emotions you're describing and I'm not sure they relate to this artificial

1487
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:36,320
world of bullshit.

1488
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:37,460
You are so right.

1489
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:38,460
You're so right.

1490
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:39,660
I'm trying to be a human.

1491
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:44,120
I even think strategically from the world of bullshit, this is a bad decision.

1492
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:50,720
Like because all you're going to do is anybody who liked Alex and thought he was onto something

1493
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:57,100
is going to look at him as somebody who is kowtowed to this guy who was wrong and definitively

1494
01:14:57,100 --> 01:15:00,420
wrong and very angrily wrong.

1495
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:01,860
Made a bet about it.

1496
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:02,860
Yeah.

1497
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:03,860
Yeah.

1498
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:04,860
The Pope's been arrested.

1499
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:05,860
Yeah.

1500
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:06,860
What about the guy we see walking away?

1501
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:07,860
You don't see anybody walking away.

1502
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:08,860
Nah, come on.

1503
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:09,860
It's great.

1504
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:12,660
So that's just going to hurt Alex's image in the audience's eyes.

1505
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:13,660
Yeah.

1506
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:18,020
The best you're going to do is you're going to attract Steve's fans to you.

1507
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:19,020
They don't care.

1508
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:20,420
Steve sells supplements too.

1509
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:21,900
It's not like you're going to get his business.

1510
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:22,900
He's going to be fine.

1511
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:23,900
Yeah.

1512
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:24,900
Wow.

1513
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:25,900
Yeah.

1514
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:26,900
This is sad.

1515
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:32,540
And for somebody whose self image is so fucking macho to really go into this interview and

1516
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:38,920
just take a little kiss on the chin, a little pat on the head, and a I'll see you next time

1517
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:39,920
is brutal.

1518
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:40,920
Yeah.

1519
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:41,920
That's brutal.

1520
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:48,000
Although flip side, I'm happy because I am too.

1521
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I like seeing Alex humiliated.

1522
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
That's enjoyable.

1523
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,800
And there's a Steve shaped hole on the show.

1524
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:53,800
That's true.

1525
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:54,800
Not anymore.

1526
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:55,800
No.

1527
01:15:55,800 --> 01:16:00,700
The guy is just like, he comes up with the baddest shit.

1528
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:01,700
Yeah.

1529
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:06,380
Now there's a fucking big head cut out of Steve directly behind Alex that you look up

1530
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:09,100
and every time you see Steve's face in his little tendrils.

1531
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:10,100
Yeah.

1532
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:11,100
His presence is back on the show.

1533
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:12,100
Oh yeah.

1534
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:13,100
We appreciate it.

1535
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:14,620
And hopefully this will reinvigorate things.

1536
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:21,820
It'll make me more interested in seeing where the fun thriller novel that Steve's writing

1537
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:22,820
goes.

1538
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:24,020
What's the next chapter?

1539
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:30,580
How do you escalate it from, I am the reason Putin owns Russia?

1540
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:31,580
I know.

1541
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:32,580
How?

1542
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:33,580
Space politics.

1543
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:34,580
Space politics.

1544
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:36,540
See, now we're getting an interesting territory.

1545
01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:37,540
Oh yes.

1546
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:38,540
Yeah.

1547
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:39,860
Eventually he's going to have to escalate it to off world.

1548
01:16:39,860 --> 01:16:41,220
Oh my God.

1549
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:43,340
Imagine disclosure happens, right?

1550
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:47,300
Even the government is like, yeah, we're, we've been in contact with aliens.

1551
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:48,900
Steve's going to have to up his game.

1552
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:49,900
Totally.

1553
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:50,900
He knows all these aliens.

1554
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:55,740
He's the one who negotiated the original treaties with the aliens.

1555
01:16:55,740 --> 01:16:57,220
As soon as, Oh God.

1556
01:16:57,220 --> 01:16:59,660
Why did Aldo Maro have to go down?

1557
01:16:59,660 --> 01:17:00,660
Aliens.

1558
01:17:00,660 --> 01:17:04,380
I would love it.

1559
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:07,100
I want disclosure to happen now just because of that.

1560
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:09,100
Yeah, it's gotta happen.

1561
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:10,100
Come on government.

1562
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:11,580
We need Steve's work here.

1563
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:12,580
Yeah.

1564
01:17:12,580 --> 01:17:14,500
Yours is secondary.

1565
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:20,620
You're bullshit about hiding secrets secondary to what bullshit Steve's going to make up.

1566
01:17:20,620 --> 01:17:21,620
Yeah.

1567
01:17:21,620 --> 01:17:28,220
You are a roadblock in terms of our sort of interesting improvisational storytelling that

1568
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:30,340
we need Steve to engage in.

1569
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:31,340
Absolutely.

1570
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:32,340
Come on government.

1571
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:33,340
Yes, and us here.

1572
01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:35,300
So that was the emergency report.

1573
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:41,060
I don't think watching it, I got convinced that there was an emergency or that January

1574
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:42,500
6th is a false flag.

1575
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:44,660
I was convinced of things I already knew.

1576
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:47,300
One, Alex is a spineless worm.

1577
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:48,620
Yeah, agreed.

1578
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:53,220
Steve is an anti-semitic lunatic.

1579
01:17:53,220 --> 01:17:56,300
Nick Fuentes is a racist asshole.

1580
01:17:56,300 --> 01:18:02,180
And Alex has nothing else to do on Saturday except come in and maybe try and sell a few

1581
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:03,180
pills.

1582
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:06,020
Yeah, it does seem like maybe he didn't have the kids that weekend or something.

1583
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:07,020
Yeah.

1584
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:08,020
Gotta move a little product.

1585
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:09,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1586
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:10,460
Anyway, we'll be back Jordan.

1587
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:12,020
But until then, we have a website.

1588
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:13,020
We do have a website.

1589
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:14,020
It's knowledgefight.com.

1590
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:15,020
Yes.

1591
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:16,020
We are also on Twitter.

1592
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:17,020
We are on Twitter.

1593
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:18,020
It's at knowledgefight.net.

1594
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:19,020
Go to Ben Jordan.

1595
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:20,020
Also on Facebook.

1596
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:21,020
We are on Facebook.

1597
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:25,100
If you could, please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

1598
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:26,100
doing God's work.

1599
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:27,100
Yeah, we'll be back.

1600
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:28,100
But until then, I'm Neo.

1601
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:29,100
I'm Leo.

1602
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:30,100
I'm DZX Clark.

1603
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:31,100
I'm Daryl Rundis.

1604
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:32,100
I installed...

1605
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:33,100
Damn it.

1606
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:38,780
I can't remember what the name of the king from Skyrim was.

1607
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:40,460
I put that guy in power.

1608
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:41,460
Okay.

1609
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:42,460
You're in Kansas.

1610
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:43,460
You're on the air.

1611
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:44,460
Thanks for holding.

1612
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:45,460
Hello, Alex.

1613
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:46,460
I'm a first time caller.

1614
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:47,460
I'm a huge fan.

1615
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:48,460
I love your work.

1616
01:18:48,460 --> 01:19:17,460
I love you.
