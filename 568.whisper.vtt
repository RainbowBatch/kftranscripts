fight, knowledge fight.com, I love you, hey everybody, welcome back to knowledge fight,

01:01.200 --> 01:04.200
I'm Dan, I'm Jordan, we're a couple of dudes, like to sit around, worship at the altar of

01:04.200 --> 01:08.200
Selene, and talk a little bit about Alex Jones, oh indeed we are Dan, Jordan, Dan, Jordan,

01:08.200 --> 01:12.200
quick question, what's up, what's your bright spot today, my bright spot today is giving

01:12.200 --> 01:18.200
some thanks to some folks, I'd like to thank, just over the weekend we recorded a little

01:18.200 --> 01:22.200
guest appearance on God awful movies, indeed we did, I'd like to thank them for having

01:22.200 --> 01:27.200
us on, and also I forgot to mention this, as always, at the end of last week, an episode

01:27.200 --> 01:33.200
that I recorded of a podcast called Your Music Saved Us, ah yes, came out, and I'd like to

01:33.200 --> 01:38.200
thank Jay and Clifton for having me on, long anticipated, we recorded it a couple of weeks

01:38.200 --> 01:43.200
ago, I was very excited for it to come out, we talked about a five iron frenzy EP, Christian

01:43.200 --> 01:50.200
Ska EP that I really liked when I was younger, and it turns out I still really like, so yeah

01:50.200 --> 01:54.200
that's a lot of fun, people should go check that out, they're on iTunes and what have

01:54.200 --> 01:58.200
you, I'm looking forward to listening to it, so yeah, my bright spot is having a little

01:58.200 --> 02:04.200
bit of fun dicking around, joining other people's shows to have a non Alex Jones related

02:04.200 --> 02:09.200
fun, I think that's great, I think it's good, it can be good from time to time, yeah, how

02:09.200 --> 02:16.200
about you? Dan, I have some exciting announcement type news, I think I know what this is, I

02:16.200 --> 02:26.200
think you do, Dan, Thursday July 1st, we will be doing the finale, episode 8 of the 6 episode

02:26.200 --> 02:35.200
series, gods damn wizard, and we will be doing it live at 9pm at the Lincoln Lodge in Chicago,

02:35.200 --> 02:40.200
that's where we'll be doing it, it's going to be interesting, it's all coming together

02:40.200 --> 02:45.200
at a very short period of time and hopefully I will finish writing it by the time we get

02:45.200 --> 02:49.200
there, yeah and hopefully there will be a link that people can get tickets to that we

02:49.200 --> 02:54.200
can put out or something, yeah I will tweet that out whenever it's available, yeah, this

02:54.200 --> 03:00.200
will be fun, although I am a little bit wary, we'll see, it's the first time being out in

03:00.200 --> 03:07.200
public in a long time, I've gone a little bit in public, but not like live performance,

03:07.200 --> 03:15.200
that's a little bit weird, yeah, but you know, time to get back to it man, maybe, we'll

03:15.200 --> 03:21.200
see, maybe not, yeah, there's also that possibility too, so also a secondary aspect of this announcement

03:21.200 --> 03:28.200
is that there isn't going to be new episodes of gods damn wizard, not next week until Thursday

03:28.200 --> 03:34.200
July 1st, we will not be doing any more episodes of that, so look forward to it, I'll tweet

03:34.200 --> 03:40.200
out the link and we'll put it up and you can catch up on the old episodes, hoorah, and

03:40.200 --> 03:44.200
then some people have asked about this and so just to make it clear and more public,

03:44.200 --> 03:49.200
like once all of it's done, you are going to release it as an audio thing, as a complete

03:49.200 --> 03:54.200
audio thing, it's just video now, but it will be audio once it's all finished up and

03:54.200 --> 04:00.200
it can be edited nice, yes, everybody needs to get me their individual audio, which some

04:00.200 --> 04:06.200
have been very very good with, this seems like a private conversation Jordan, so today

04:06.200 --> 04:11.200
on the podcast Jordan, we're going to be talking about some modern day Beasiness, we're

04:11.200 --> 04:16.200
going to be talking about an emergency broadcast that Alex did on Saturday, I almost screamed

04:16.200 --> 04:23.200
blackjack, this is from June 19th 2021, blackjack, oh that was close, yeah, that was tight, this

04:23.200 --> 04:29.200
is an emergency episode that Alex did and I was glad that he did an emergency episode

04:29.200 --> 04:34.200
because I was struggling, I was treading water, sure, thinking about covering his present

04:34.200 --> 04:39.200
day nonsense, yeah, and then this emergency broadcast happened and something monumental

04:39.200 --> 04:46.200
went down, okay, something that we have been waiting for, ooh, for a while, all right,

04:46.200 --> 04:50.200
okay, so it's actually something monumental and not some bullshit, it's some bullshit,

04:50.200 --> 04:56.200
oh okay, never mind, yeah, no, it was something I've been excited about happening, it's

04:56.200 --> 05:00.200
bullshit, okay, that's fair, that's fair, so we'll get down to business on this, but

05:00.200 --> 05:03.200
before we do Jordan, we're going to take a little moment to say thank you and welcome

05:03.200 --> 05:07.200
in some wonks, oh that's a great idea, so first congratulations to Paul on the birth

05:07.200 --> 05:13.200
of his first child Riley, this was sent in by Ryan, I guess we're going to say Riley

05:13.200 --> 05:18.200
is a policy wonk, okay, I'm a policy wonk, thank you very much Ryan and on behalf of

05:18.200 --> 05:23.200
Riley and Paul, yes, next, Alias McFakeName, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk,

05:23.200 --> 05:28.200
I'm a policy wonk, thank you very much, what a strange name to be born with, yeah,

05:28.200 --> 05:33.200
Cool Disco George, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk, I'm a policy wonk,

05:33.200 --> 05:38.200
thanks, Disco George, and DJ Spouse Mouse, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk,

05:38.200 --> 05:42.200
I'm a policy wonk, thank you very much, DJ Spouse Mouse, thank you, now the little

05:42.200 --> 05:48.200
bit of a shorter policy wonk thing, but that's because, giving someone life is giving

05:48.200 --> 05:59.200
someone death, you could say that life is death, you could, Joel had a birthday, shouting

05:59.200 --> 06:05.200
something out to someone is also shouting something into someone, and giving life, exactly,

06:05.200 --> 06:10.200
so Joel had a birthday last week, Tammy reached out, wanted to wish a happy birthday,

06:10.200 --> 06:15.200
Joel happy birthday to you, happy birthday, Denise, how you doing out there, hope you

06:15.200 --> 06:19.200
have a happy birthday, your son Will hit me up, and wanted us to wish you a happy birthday,

06:19.200 --> 06:23.200
I thought it might have been Killer Mike, his mom was named Denise, is that right, yeah,

06:23.200 --> 06:32.200
yeah, great trivia, next John has a birthday, from Theresa, Theresa says hey happy birthday,

06:32.200 --> 06:39.200
and so do we, we joined Theresa, happy birthday, Dusty, not Dusty Springfield, not Dusty Rhodes,

06:39.200 --> 06:44.200
no he's passed, this person is still alive, as evidenced by their birthday being this

06:44.200 --> 06:49.200
week, how's old man house phone doing, oh shit, Carrie was the one who reached out and

06:49.200 --> 06:53.200
wanted us to wish Dusty a happy birthday, happy birthday Dusty, and then finally very

06:53.200 --> 07:00.200
special from Michael, this is a happy birthday technocrat shout out, combo situation, wow,

07:00.200 --> 07:06.200
put it all together, for Ali G, not Borat, not Borat, no not Borat, okay, okay, Ali G

07:06.200 --> 07:12.200
aka Spills with a Z, happy birthday and you are a technocrat, I'm a policy wonk, crikey

07:12.200 --> 07:17.200
mate, that's fantastic, have yourself a brew, how's your 401k doing bro, we gotta go full

07:17.200 --> 07:21.200
tilt boogie on this Watson alright, let's just get down to business, we ain't making

07:21.200 --> 07:27.200
that money off that heroin, why you pimps so good, my neck is freakishly large, I declare

07:27.200 --> 07:32.200
info war on you, giving life is giving death, happy birthday to all, indeed, so Jordan we're

07:32.200 --> 07:40.200
gonna start this thing off and Alex goes for an unconventional approach on this emergency

07:40.200 --> 07:45.200
broadcast, wait, it's an emergency broadcast, yeah, and he's gonna open it with something

07:45.200 --> 07:51.200
other than screaming, this is an emergency, yeah, okay, now I'm interested, and if I was

07:51.200 --> 07:58.200
gauging from the title of this video, I would say that it's, the emergency is that the January

07:58.200 --> 08:03.200
6th storming of the capital was a false flag, oh, that does not sound like as much of an

08:03.200 --> 08:08.200
emergency as I was expecting, no, I don't know, I still, I mean I've watched all of

08:08.200 --> 08:12.200
this, I still don't actually understand how this qualifies as an emergency that requires

08:12.200 --> 08:16.200
another broadcast, yeah, don't you have to take immediate action in an emergency, you

08:16.200 --> 08:21.200
should, or at least you need to be aware of something really fast, yes, and this is standard

08:21.200 --> 08:26.200
info wars lore at this point, not good, it's a talking point that's really just like, yeah,

08:26.200 --> 08:30.200
alright, everyone who's listening would see that headline and be like, we know, yeah,

08:30.200 --> 08:36.200
Antifa, false flags, duh, the whole thing, FBI, CIA, Trump was probably not or is in

08:36.200 --> 08:41.200
on it now, yeah, and one of the things I was really thinking about is it seems really weird

08:41.200 --> 08:46.200
on first glance that Alex is doing that, having an emergency broadcast about like the 6th

08:46.200 --> 08:51.200
being a false flag, all the information, yeah, but it makes some sense, I mean if you really

08:51.200 --> 08:56.200
think about it, from all publicly available information, Alex seems like he's on pretty

08:56.200 --> 09:01.200
solid footing legally speaking, sure, as it relates to the storming of the capital, okay,

09:01.200 --> 09:05.200
it seems like something that's getting him a lot of attention, he constantly is trending

09:05.200 --> 09:10.200
on Twitter because people are like, they found this video of him being like, Trump told me

09:10.200 --> 09:14.200
to lead a march, oh man, you know, and like, I think it's probably something really good

09:14.200 --> 09:18.200
to lean into for him, yeah, there's a lot of attention, there's a lot of possibility

09:18.200 --> 09:24.200
for claiming that people are misrepresenting him, totally, I think it's probably, as long

09:24.200 --> 09:29.200
as he doesn't end up defaming anybody in the process, like, uh oh, this is probably a good

09:29.200 --> 09:36.200
thing for him to do, uh oh, there we go, there is a downside, as he is getting this attention,

09:36.200 --> 09:40.200
he knows that he needs to, you know, turn it into something, capitalize, so I love that

09:40.200 --> 09:44.200
crew, and I love the boom operator that's been here seven days, so I know he's gonna

09:44.200 --> 09:48.200
be here tomorrow for the Sunday show, I just wanna thank them, and I'm gonna hit this big

09:48.200 --> 09:53.200
news, then I'm gonna go right to these guests, but instead of always doing it as a footnote

09:53.200 --> 09:58.200
at the end, I'm gonna do it right now, because I've got a bunch of reporters I wanna hire,

09:58.200 --> 10:05.200
and I've got operations I wanna launch, and I've got things I wanna do, and I can't do

10:05.200 --> 10:13.200
it without your support, so, this coming Monday morning, this big sale of high quality organic

10:13.200 --> 10:21.200
vitamin D3, starts off with a very explicit plug, starts off the emergency broadcast with

10:21.200 --> 10:27.200
an ad, well because like his staff is overworked, which seems like a him problem, that seems

10:27.200 --> 10:31.200
like a management issue, you could probably hire more staff if they're overworked, or

10:31.200 --> 10:36.200
cut back, or cut back, yeah, find ways to do this on more of a shoestring, sure, lower

10:36.200 --> 10:40.200
your overhead, right, yeah, right, but, because these people are working seven days a week,

10:40.200 --> 10:45.200
it needs to hire more people, and therefore you need B12, or two, or whatever, you need

10:45.200 --> 10:50.200
vitamins, that does sound true, and they'll give you a lot of energy, right, and sometimes,

10:50.200 --> 10:54.200
Jordan, you're laughing, but sometimes, sure, when you're a person who has a lot of energy,

10:54.200 --> 10:58.200
people think you're on cocaine, that's, hmm, and then we've got the three new products

10:58.200 --> 11:02.200
by new, the new ones that finally came in with the supply chain breakdown, that we're

11:02.200 --> 11:06.200
discounting, is your habituated discounts, and I get it, and I made it that way, it's

11:06.200 --> 11:11.200
my fault, but now we have to sell stuff on sale, even though it's gonna sell out, because

11:11.200 --> 11:14.200
you don't buy it unless it's on sale, and then stuff's sold out for six, eight months,

11:14.200 --> 11:16.200
that's okay.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.200
Are you complaining to me about you?

11:18.200 --> 11:22.200
X3, back in stock, the tri-ionine for your immune system, your body, your energy, your

11:22.200 --> 11:26.200
libido, everything, back in stock, 60% off, and free shipping, double Patriot points,

11:26.200 --> 11:31.200
ultimate krill oil, 40% off, and of course, the bio-crystalline for the mustard seed,

11:31.200 --> 11:38.200
all at info.warstore.com, right there, and I'm telling you, that's lightning in a bottle,

11:38.200 --> 11:44.200
that's how we fund this operation, and people always ask, why do you got so much energy?

11:44.200 --> 11:49.200
I remember one time I was totally down, exhausted, I've been on there about 10 hours, and I went

11:49.200 --> 11:54.200
in the bathroom to take a piss, and I walked out, and one of the security guys saw me ranting

11:54.200 --> 11:57.200
Rave on air, and he said, my God, or what drugs, you ain't gonna have a heart attack,

11:57.200 --> 11:58.200
are you on cocaine?

11:58.200 --> 12:00.200
I said, I hate cocaine, I'm not on drugs.

12:00.200 --> 12:02.200
I said, I'm in a war.

12:02.200 --> 12:07.200
Well, how'd you go from looking completely exhausted, to look like you're ready to kill

12:07.200 --> 12:08.200
somebody coming out of that bathroom?

12:08.200 --> 12:12.200
Oh, because I looked at that mirror, and I said, I'm not gonna be these people's slaves,

12:12.200 --> 12:14.200
I'm not gonna bow out of them.

12:14.200 --> 12:20.200
I will not be your slave ever.

12:20.200 --> 12:25.200
And it's gonna take that type of attitude, that's gonna smash these pedophile scum, that

12:25.200 --> 12:28.200
are anti-human, and are jacked into some evil.

12:28.200 --> 12:32.200
So that's what I'm on, is a life force.

12:32.200 --> 12:38.200
And to quote John Paul Jones, I've only begun to fight.

12:38.200 --> 12:43.200
But I really appreciate this crew, and this audience, for keeping us in the fight, and

12:43.200 --> 12:46.200
I need you to keep me in the fight, now.

12:46.200 --> 12:53.200
Now, I'll give you everything I've got, because to submit to these people's death, but all

12:53.200 --> 12:57.200
I need is your word of mouth, and your prayers, and your support.

12:57.200 --> 12:58.200
Please, just give me money.

12:58.200 --> 12:59.200
Wow.

12:59.200 --> 13:01.200
I will fake mood swings.

13:01.200 --> 13:03.200
That was pathetic.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.200
That was really pathetic.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.200
Yeah.

13:06.200 --> 13:07.200
That was really sad.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.200
There's two things that I love.

13:08.200 --> 13:13.200
One is how artificial that mood swing is.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.200
And if it's not, he needs to see a doctor.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.200
Yeah.

13:16.200 --> 13:18.200
Because that is outrageous, unacceptable.

13:18.200 --> 13:19.200
Yeah.

13:19.200 --> 13:24.200
The second thing is, when he's talking about not being on cocaine, he describes going to

13:24.200 --> 13:27.200
a bathroom, which is where people do cocaine.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.200
Almost entirely, yeah.

13:28.200 --> 13:29.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:29.200 --> 13:30.200
You know what was crazy?

13:30.200 --> 13:34.200
All those stories about Studio 54 back in the day.

13:34.200 --> 13:37.200
People would always go into the bathroom, and they'd just scream into the mirror.

13:37.200 --> 13:41.200
They'd be like, I'm going to dance!

13:41.200 --> 13:45.200
I'm not somebody who's done a lot of cocaine in my life, but I'm not going to say that

13:45.200 --> 13:46.200
I never have.

13:46.200 --> 13:52.200
But I will say that I don't think I've ever done it outside a bathroom.

13:52.200 --> 13:57.200
I think we can include laundry rooms.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.200
Hard to say.

13:58.200 --> 13:59.200
Hard to say.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.200
Yeah, so I don't know.

14:00.200 --> 14:01.200
I think Alex is on cocaine.

14:01.200 --> 14:02.200
Yeah.

14:02.200 --> 14:05.200
Or just, I don't know.

14:05.200 --> 14:07.200
Everything is so fake about the passion.

14:07.200 --> 14:10.200
Yeah, that's really bad acting.

14:10.200 --> 14:11.200
That's really bad acting.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.200
Yeah.

14:12.200 --> 14:16.200
But he'll continue doing that as fakely as long as you pay him.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.200
Please give him some money.

14:17.200 --> 14:23.200
Yeah, I don't like being chastised for taking advantage of his discounts and then him being

14:23.200 --> 14:26.200
like, now I can't sell it at full price anymore.

14:26.200 --> 14:27.200
That's funny.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.200
Like, don't tell me.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.200
Don't tell me that.

14:30.200 --> 14:34.200
I put things on sale too much, and now people are used to it, and they know that I'll just

14:34.200 --> 14:37.200
put everything on sale in a week if it's not on sale now.

14:37.200 --> 14:42.200
They never buy anything at a real normal price, so I have to buy things on sale.

14:42.200 --> 14:43.200
Fuck you.

14:43.200 --> 14:44.200
That's every time.

14:44.200 --> 14:47.320
Yeah, that's like if every time you went to Walgreens, they're like, oh, you're really

14:47.320 --> 14:51.900
only going to buy these Reese's cups on fucking two for $3 day, huh?

14:51.900 --> 14:56.200
You're not going to buy them on a one for $1.99 day, you piece of shit.

14:56.200 --> 15:01.440
If one employee at Walgreens, like after Easter, like the day after Easter, their job was just

15:01.440 --> 15:03.200
to boo at everybody.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.200
Oh, now you want eggs.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.200
You want the Easter eggs, huh?

15:07.200 --> 15:08.200
Oh, they're delicious.

15:08.200 --> 15:09.200
Oh, they're so good.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.200
Yeah.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.200
So Alex gets to some of the news.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.200
All right, let me show you these articles.

15:14.200 --> 15:16.200
We'll start going to these guests.

15:16.200 --> 15:17.200
Look at these.

15:17.200 --> 15:21.960
The big revolver article that's got the globalist running scared, and that's a good thing, and

15:21.960 --> 15:28.840
we literally foresaw it and pushed it together three weeks ago.

15:28.840 --> 15:34.060
This enemy of freedom, White House unveils new strategy to counter domestic terrorism.

15:34.060 --> 15:40.400
They mean real Americans, laser focus on violence, the same thing Brennan, that communist pervert

15:40.400 --> 15:41.400
said.

15:41.400 --> 15:42.400
What?

15:42.400 --> 15:45.880
White House unveils strategy to combat domestic extremism.

15:45.880 --> 15:46.880
It's everywhere.

15:46.880 --> 15:48.460
It's their whole operation.

15:48.460 --> 15:51.720
So first of all, this article isn't on revolver.

15:51.720 --> 15:55.360
Revolver isn't so much a news site as much as it is an attempt to make a new Drudge report

15:55.360 --> 15:58.280
now that the Trump camp has turned on Drudge.

15:58.280 --> 16:01.880
It's just a bunch of links to clickbait headlines for the most part.

16:01.880 --> 16:05.680
The actual article that Alex is talking about here in this clip is from The Hill.

16:05.680 --> 16:09.520
The article is not some kind of a bombshell that has the globalists running scared.

16:09.520 --> 16:12.760
It's a discussion about how the plans that have been floated by Biden's administration

16:12.760 --> 16:16.920
have some possibly good ideas, but also there's some serious blind spots.

16:16.920 --> 16:19.920
For instance, here's a quote that's included in that article.

16:19.920 --> 16:24.220
Quote, the Biden administration is rightly focused on addressing white supremacist violence,

16:24.220 --> 16:28.000
but its strategy includes none of the civil rights and liberty safeguards that rights

16:28.000 --> 16:31.360
groups and communities of color have long sought.

16:31.360 --> 16:36.800
That's a criticism of Biden's plan that was put out in a statement by the ACLU, a group

16:36.800 --> 16:39.600
that Alex believes is high level globalist.

16:39.600 --> 16:43.480
It seems like the ACLU shouldn't be getting in the mix trying to sow doubt about the globalist

16:43.480 --> 16:47.640
plans if they're on board with the globalist plans, but look, man, I'm not a 30 dimension

16:47.640 --> 16:49.160
chess player or whatever the fuck.

16:49.160 --> 16:50.160
Yeah.

16:50.160 --> 16:55.600
If I was a 30 dimension chess player, I would say that Alex's opposition to this makes more

16:55.600 --> 16:59.080
sense or no, nevermind.

16:59.080 --> 17:01.080
It doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

17:01.080 --> 17:04.960
On some level, if I were Alex, I would see that new plan that Biden put out as a real

17:04.960 --> 17:07.120
threat to my business model.

17:07.120 --> 17:11.040
One of the pillars of the plan is to quote, confront long-term contributors to domestic

17:11.040 --> 17:12.040
terrorism.

17:12.040 --> 17:16.080
In that section, they say, quote, the US government will also work to find ways to counter the

17:16.080 --> 17:20.760
polarization often fueled by disinformation, misinformation, and dangerous conspiracy theories

17:20.760 --> 17:26.200
online, supporting an information environment that fosters healthy democratic discourse.

17:26.200 --> 17:30.280
I'm not sure that I believe that they're capable of achieving that goal, but if I were Alex,

17:30.280 --> 17:34.760
I would recognize that this looks like a situation where he might not get to fly completely under

17:34.760 --> 17:36.120
the radar moving forward.

17:36.120 --> 17:37.720
Yeah, that might not be good for him.

17:37.720 --> 17:42.280
I have some qualms with the plan, but it's not really a specific plan.

17:42.280 --> 17:46.840
It's very general and critiquing the general plan is good for conversation and for fostering

17:46.840 --> 17:47.840
better ideas.

17:47.840 --> 17:48.840
Sure.

17:48.840 --> 17:52.600
Getting the best ideas possible, but I don't think it's where the actual fights are going

17:52.600 --> 17:53.600
to happen.

17:53.600 --> 17:54.600
Yeah.

17:54.600 --> 17:55.600
Yeah.

17:55.600 --> 17:59.720
I mean, I think the only thing about any of those plans has always got to like boil down

17:59.720 --> 18:06.920
to, Hey, Hey guys, guys, tell me honestly, when there's a Republican president or even

18:06.920 --> 18:11.000
this president, will this be primarily used to hurt leftist activists?

18:11.000 --> 18:13.120
And the answer is 99% of the time, yes.

18:13.120 --> 18:16.960
So certainly let's, let's calm it down on our plans real quick.

18:16.960 --> 18:21.960
So Alex is, you know, the false flag, January 6th was a false flag.

18:21.960 --> 18:22.960
Sure.

18:22.960 --> 18:24.800
And you know what other people have false flagged before.

18:24.800 --> 18:32.800
Now we know from listening to 2003 that whenever this line of conversation would come up, Putin,

18:32.800 --> 18:38.240
it would be Alex would use Putin as an example, use it every day in 2003, slightly different

18:38.240 --> 18:39.240
in the present.

18:39.240 --> 18:43.080
Oh, just as the old czarist would stage attacks.

18:43.080 --> 18:47.120
And just as the old KGB would do it and Hitler launched world war II on the back of stage

18:47.120 --> 18:48.120
attacks.

18:48.120 --> 18:52.680
Somebody was in the old KGB to remember, and it's something that corrupt declining systems

18:52.680 --> 18:53.680
do.

18:53.680 --> 18:54.680
Huh?

18:54.680 --> 19:01.720
I think his phrasing is a little weird that he would call corrupt collapsing countries

19:01.720 --> 19:03.040
that did this.

19:03.040 --> 19:08.360
You know, like it seems weird that there would be one very obvious example while 18 years

19:08.360 --> 19:09.640
changes the man.

19:09.640 --> 19:10.640
Yeah.

19:10.640 --> 19:15.920
So Alex gets to what he's planning to do for the beginning of this emergency report.

19:15.920 --> 19:24.640
Now I'm going to hand this over to an interview I did on Friday with one of the main lawyers

19:24.640 --> 19:28.320
who is defending people arrested in the Capitol.

19:28.320 --> 19:30.900
So this is an interview from Friday.

19:30.900 --> 19:34.960
And then I've got an interview that some watch, but not enough of my head of security, Tim

19:34.960 --> 19:43.360
Enlow from January 6th, when he witnessed what he saw and what happened, he ended up

19:43.360 --> 19:51.440
telling the story a little while after it unfolded when we were on a family vacation

19:51.440 --> 19:52.440
in Utah.

19:52.440 --> 19:57.280
And Tim Enlow goes through exactly what really transpired and what happened.

19:57.280 --> 20:03.600
So Alex plays like 20 seconds of like a lawyer and it's like, I don't even know how to make,

20:03.600 --> 20:05.720
I don't even know how to make heads or tails of it.

20:05.720 --> 20:09.260
And then a very long conversation he had with his security guard.

20:09.260 --> 20:11.720
It was easier to get him.

20:11.720 --> 20:17.040
On a family vacation, he interviewed his security guard.

20:17.040 --> 20:18.400
Also Rob Dew is there.

20:18.400 --> 20:19.400
Oh man.

20:19.400 --> 20:20.400
Yeah.

20:20.400 --> 20:21.400
What a good dad.

20:21.400 --> 20:27.120
The Utah trip was when he went to his food supplier, my Patriot supply warehouse.

20:27.120 --> 20:33.160
So I don't, family vacation with the security guard going to your disaster food supplier.

20:33.160 --> 20:36.040
Yeah, that's, that's kind of, that sucks.

20:36.040 --> 20:37.160
That's just a business trip.

20:37.160 --> 20:40.240
That's not even a workcation or whatever it is you want to call it.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.240
That's just going to work.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.240
Yeah.

20:42.240 --> 20:44.520
If you're the kids and you're along for that, you're not having a great time.

20:44.520 --> 20:45.520
Bummer.

20:45.520 --> 20:46.520
And you're in Utah.

20:46.520 --> 20:47.520
I mean Salt Lake City is nice.

20:47.520 --> 20:48.520
Sure.

20:48.520 --> 20:52.880
But you don't need to listen to anything of the security guard because it's honestly just

20:52.880 --> 20:57.960
exactly what they've said pretty much all along, which is, you know, Hey, we were asked

20:57.960 --> 21:05.040
to lead this, uh, like March to the Capitol because there was another stage that was going

21:05.040 --> 21:06.120
to be set up there.

21:06.120 --> 21:08.120
There was going to be another rally.

21:08.120 --> 21:10.760
And as far as I can tell, that makes sense.

21:10.760 --> 21:14.720
It seems like everyone's actions make sense based on that.

21:14.720 --> 21:18.160
Trump was on stage saying that he was going to March down with them.

21:18.160 --> 21:19.160
Yep.

21:19.160 --> 21:23.360
They're going to have another rally to give strength to the spine, needing Republicans.

21:23.360 --> 21:24.360
Yep.

21:24.360 --> 21:26.360
You know, and sure.

21:26.360 --> 21:27.360
I don't know.

21:27.360 --> 21:29.840
I found, I found the interview incredibly boring.

21:29.840 --> 21:30.840
Yeah.

21:30.840 --> 21:33.920
It doesn't contradict any of the things that I think are actually the problems.

21:33.920 --> 21:34.920
Yeah.

21:34.920 --> 21:35.920
Yeah.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.520
So it's just kind of, it's on the side.

21:37.520 --> 21:44.080
No, their defense is, I mean, it rings true just because it's the only part of the story

21:44.080 --> 21:48.920
that they have told exactly the same way over and over and over again, you know, like every

21:48.920 --> 21:49.920
other part of it.

21:49.920 --> 21:50.920
Oh, it's a false flag.

21:50.920 --> 21:51.920
Antifa was in there.

21:51.920 --> 21:57.320
All that stuff has changed 30 times in the first week after it happened.

21:57.320 --> 21:58.320
True.

21:58.320 --> 22:03.380
But the story of like, we weren't instigating, we were walking here, always the same, always

22:03.380 --> 22:04.380
the same.

22:04.380 --> 22:08.680
And the video of Alex very clearly being like, don't do this.

22:08.680 --> 22:12.480
Like it, yeah, it checks out and it does follow his behavior.

22:12.480 --> 22:17.680
Even from when I was watching the live coverage on the day, the way that Harrison Smith was

22:17.680 --> 22:22.360
celebrating it and then once Alex realized shit was going down, everything changed.

22:22.360 --> 22:27.100
The coverage on InfoWars changed because Alex was in the field.

22:27.100 --> 22:29.520
He didn't have control over what Harrison was doing.

22:29.520 --> 22:30.520
Right.

22:30.520 --> 22:33.020
And then they got the script and they realized, oh shit.

22:33.020 --> 22:37.440
And Alex, like there's also video of like one of his employees trying to get the police

22:37.440 --> 22:41.800
to let Alex get on like a megaphone to like calm the crowd down.

22:41.800 --> 22:44.080
Like first of all, if you're the cop, absolutely not.

22:44.080 --> 22:45.520
No, no, no, no, no way.

22:45.520 --> 22:47.240
No way am I giving Alex Jones a megaphone.

22:47.240 --> 22:49.640
Because what if you do and then he's like, take the building.

22:49.640 --> 22:51.600
Oh, he can go rogue at any time.

22:51.600 --> 22:52.880
You can't trust him.

22:52.880 --> 22:54.820
He's not a, he's a rogue agent.

22:54.820 --> 22:57.980
And even best case scenario, he gets up there and he's like, hey, everybody stop.

22:57.980 --> 22:58.980
And then they don't.

22:58.980 --> 22:59.980
Yeah.

22:59.980 --> 23:01.240
It's a no win situation.

23:01.240 --> 23:05.740
But the video that they have of their actions and their behavior on that day, unless somebody

23:05.740 --> 23:11.020
can provide actual evidence of them doing that as cover for what they're doing behind

23:11.020 --> 23:15.600
the scenes, unless that can be demonstrated, then I just, I don't know.

23:15.600 --> 23:21.960
I don't think the story of Alex's actual actions that day are as important as the, the story

23:21.960 --> 23:28.720
and the conversation about how these narratives propelled people to these actions.

23:28.720 --> 23:29.720
Agreed.

23:29.720 --> 23:35.720
I think the thing that bothers me most about people being like, see Alex, look at these

23:35.720 --> 23:36.720
videos.

23:36.720 --> 23:42.840
He was there and he was leading all this shit is that ultimately you're giving Alex too

23:42.840 --> 23:43.840
much credit.

23:43.840 --> 23:44.840
Yeah.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.500
You're turning him into like Darth Vader.

23:46.500 --> 23:53.080
He is too much of a coward to ever even come close to doing something like that.

23:53.080 --> 23:56.640
And so whenever you give him that kind of like, I'm sure part of the reason that he

23:56.640 --> 24:00.680
wants to do this is just so he can be like, see, look at how, look at how strong people

24:00.680 --> 24:01.680
think I am.

24:01.680 --> 24:04.740
Look at how much people think I could be running everything.

24:04.740 --> 24:10.120
If only I weren't so much of a giant fucking coward, you know, coward and I mean just a

24:10.120 --> 24:11.120
stumble bum.

24:11.120 --> 24:12.120
Yeah.

24:12.120 --> 24:13.120
Yeah.

24:13.120 --> 24:15.360
Like for the brand and it's a business and all of that stuff.

24:15.360 --> 24:20.680
But I mean, ultimately I really don't think he has the, the courage to do something like

24:20.680 --> 24:21.680
that.

24:21.680 --> 24:22.680
I would be surprised.

24:22.680 --> 24:23.680
Yeah.

24:23.680 --> 24:28.880
Um, speaking of the business though, uh, Alex does play an ad after, I think this is after

24:28.880 --> 24:32.880
the security guard interview and I just thought this was really funny.

24:32.880 --> 24:35.480
The globalists want all of us to be victims.

24:35.480 --> 24:39.880
Everything they do is about debilitating us, dumbing us down, making us sickly and trying

24:39.880 --> 24:42.560
to cut us off from each other and cut us off from God.

24:42.560 --> 24:47.760
Well, about four years ago, the Jones family began to care out a ritual of health.

24:47.760 --> 24:52.520
Every three or four days I get out a scoop of a mineral fusion or two, put it in a glass

24:52.520 --> 24:56.980
pitcher, stir it up, put some ice in it, put in the refrigerator and at least once or twice

24:56.980 --> 25:01.200
a day have a refreshing, totally healthy, nutritious drink.

25:01.200 --> 25:05.760
So yeah, Alex's family has a ritual of making juice from, from powder.

25:05.760 --> 25:07.360
Aye, man.

25:07.360 --> 25:12.200
I just think it's fun to, to like call it a ritual, the globalists are trying to kill

25:12.200 --> 25:13.200
us all off.

25:13.200 --> 25:16.960
And so in order to fight back, my family has a new ritual, which is we make juice.

25:16.960 --> 25:20.840
We make Kool-Aid, uh, pretty regularly, but it's healthy Kool-Aid.

25:20.840 --> 25:25.520
You know, like if you've ever seen those Sunny D commercials, we're like, no Sunny D, we're

25:25.520 --> 25:26.920
going to make our own stuff.

25:26.920 --> 25:28.440
You know, we're cool like that.

25:28.440 --> 25:29.440
All right.

25:29.440 --> 25:30.800
I just think that's fun.

25:30.800 --> 25:31.800
The phrasing is fun.

25:31.800 --> 25:32.800
Yeah.

25:32.800 --> 25:36.440
Something that's less fun is that Alex then, uh, starts having some guests.

25:36.440 --> 25:38.040
Oh, that's no fun.

25:38.040 --> 25:39.040
No.

25:39.040 --> 25:40.040
Is Stuart Rhodes one of them?

25:40.040 --> 25:41.040
Nick Fuentes joins us.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.040
We appreciate his time.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.040
Talk about this.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.040
Wow.

25:44.040 --> 25:45.040
What a historic point.

25:45.040 --> 25:46.520
What a crazy thing to be involved with, Nick.

25:46.520 --> 25:47.520
No.

25:47.520 --> 25:52.000
Well, and it's a really groundbreaking new report here from Revolve where I think it's

25:52.000 --> 25:57.080
blown the lid wide open on this entire situation and hopefully given some clarity about what

25:57.080 --> 25:58.440
really went on on that day.

25:58.440 --> 25:59.440
Right?

25:59.440 --> 26:00.440
Yeah.

26:00.440 --> 26:06.680
I think maybe baby bigot, uh, Nick Fuentes is in the mix and I kind of misspoke earlier.

26:06.680 --> 26:10.880
Revolver is primarily just a link aggregator like Drudge, but they do actually post some

26:10.880 --> 26:12.080
of their own blog content.

26:12.080 --> 26:16.560
And I think what happened earlier is that Alex referenced a link they posted to this

26:16.560 --> 26:20.960
Hill article when his talking point for the day was supposed to be about this blog that

26:20.960 --> 26:22.200
Nick brings up.

26:22.200 --> 26:23.200
Gotcha.

26:23.200 --> 26:24.200
Gotcha.

26:24.200 --> 26:27.880
This is just a really overwritten plea for people to insist that the only relevant variable

26:27.880 --> 26:32.560
in terms of January 6th is whether or not law enforcement had moles inside the Proud

26:32.560 --> 26:35.600
Boys, Oath Keepers, and the Three Percenters.

26:35.600 --> 26:37.280
That's the only thing that matters.

26:37.280 --> 26:41.480
And if law enforcement did, then the whole thing has to be a sham.

26:41.480 --> 26:44.460
One paragraph really stood out to me as dumb quote.

26:44.460 --> 26:48.440
If it turns out that the federal government, FBI, army counterintelligence, or a similar

26:48.440 --> 26:53.260
agency had undercover agents or confidential informants embedded in any of the groups involved

26:53.260 --> 26:58.800
in January 6th, the federal intelligence agencies failing to warn of a potential for violence

26:58.800 --> 27:03.920
looks less like an innocent mistake and more like something sinister.

27:03.920 --> 27:08.600
This is part of a discussion about how the excuse that has been used to explain the storming

27:08.600 --> 27:12.840
that there was an intelligence failure, but if that's what was used, but if there were

27:12.840 --> 27:15.500
any informants, then that can't be true.

27:15.500 --> 27:18.800
And that's a suspicious thing that they're using that excuse now.

27:18.800 --> 27:19.800
Sure.

27:19.800 --> 27:23.200
Anyone who has any idea how these types of groups operate knows that this sentiment is

27:23.200 --> 27:25.840
just… so dumb.

27:25.840 --> 27:29.280
Groups like the Oath Keepers specifically follow a leaderless resistance model, so they

27:29.280 --> 27:32.900
can avoid damage that confidential informants can't cause.

27:32.900 --> 27:36.720
One group inside the organization might have no idea what another group is up to, and it's

27:36.720 --> 27:38.680
best if it stays that way.

27:38.680 --> 27:42.440
There are central figures in these organizations like Stuart Rhodes for the Oath Keepers or

27:42.440 --> 27:45.960
Enrique Tarrio for the Proud Boys, but they aren't going to know what each of their

27:45.960 --> 27:48.000
splinter groups is up to.

27:48.000 --> 27:53.240
They set up their groups like disconnected franchises because then it's harder to disrupt.

27:53.240 --> 27:56.760
This is a classic strategy that the extreme right wing has been using for a long time,

27:56.760 --> 27:59.640
but specifically since the 90s.

27:59.640 --> 28:00.640
And terrorists.

28:00.640 --> 28:01.640
And all terrorists.

28:01.640 --> 28:06.920
But very explicitly you can find conversations in right wing circles of this being their

28:06.920 --> 28:08.320
model since the 90s.

28:08.320 --> 28:15.080
Yeah, I mean they wanted to create an insurgent attitude and they have 100% done so.

28:15.080 --> 28:17.840
Even Alex's show operates kind of this way.

28:17.840 --> 28:22.000
When Millie Weaver put out Shadow Gate, it was pretty clear that Alex had no idea what

28:22.000 --> 28:23.820
she was doing with her time.

28:23.820 --> 28:27.440
He was paying for the documentary, but he didn't know what her point was, who she

28:27.440 --> 28:29.720
was talking to, he didn't know anything.

28:29.720 --> 28:34.940
She, as is the case with most of his employees, are tasked with knowing what they're supposed

28:34.940 --> 28:39.640
to do, and operating in ways where Alex has plausible deniability to not be personally

28:39.640 --> 28:42.920
implicated if something they do is a fuck up.

28:42.920 --> 28:46.480
Pretending that an informant in any of these organizations would definitively prove that

28:46.480 --> 28:50.360
the government had all the information about the group's plans is just dumb.

28:50.360 --> 28:53.840
And I refuse to believe that whoever wrote this piece doesn't know that.

28:53.840 --> 28:57.280
This is just sort of like a defense argument, it's not even a real argument.

28:57.280 --> 28:58.720
Yeah, that's kind of ridiculous.

28:58.720 --> 29:03.960
I tried to read this piece, and it basically just boils down to how there are people who

29:03.960 --> 29:09.560
are left anonymous in charging documents for the Oath Keepers, you know, charging documents

29:09.560 --> 29:13.880
for the Oath Keepers who were indicted in the storming, and there's names that are not

29:13.880 --> 29:17.040
listed in there, like person two, person three.

29:17.040 --> 29:19.960
And so like, what if these are people who are FBI agents?

29:19.960 --> 29:20.960
Sure.

29:20.960 --> 29:21.960
Eh?

29:21.960 --> 29:22.960
Eh?

29:22.960 --> 29:25.800
It's full of enticing speculation, but it literally proves nothing.

29:25.800 --> 29:29.480
It's just, it's a very long article that proves nothing.

29:29.480 --> 29:33.760
So then it's not even, they're not even making the argument that it's a false flag so much

29:33.760 --> 29:34.760
as it's entrapment?

29:34.760 --> 29:38.560
Yeah, yeah, but I mean, a false flag can mean whatever you want now.

29:38.560 --> 29:39.560
Sure, sure.

29:39.560 --> 29:40.560
Well, that's fair.

29:40.560 --> 29:44.520
It is fair that words have no meaning in this world.

29:44.520 --> 29:45.520
Not anymore.

29:45.520 --> 29:46.520
Yeah.

29:46.520 --> 29:53.120
So the idea is that these FBI agents inside these groups, who are now these unnamed people

29:53.120 --> 29:56.920
in the charging documents, are FBI, they're all FBI agents.

29:56.920 --> 29:57.920
All FBI.

29:57.920 --> 29:58.920
And guess what?

29:58.920 --> 29:59.920
Alex knows who they are.

29:59.920 --> 30:00.920
Okay.

30:00.920 --> 30:03.980
Because I have a lot of sources, and let's just leave it at that.

30:03.980 --> 30:08.000
We know the names of the FBI agents that are actually in the building, not just informants.

30:08.000 --> 30:12.480
What are they going to do, Nick, in the next few weeks and months when that's all released?

30:12.480 --> 30:13.480
I mean, it's perfect.

30:13.480 --> 30:16.720
And they just spun and said, yeah, we were in there to try to stop it.

30:16.720 --> 30:19.000
They could, but no, they denied it all, Nick.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.440
They've taken the bait again.

30:20.440 --> 30:24.960
Watch this space for Alex to announce the names of his FBI agents.

30:24.960 --> 30:25.960
Wow.

30:25.960 --> 30:27.480
I can't wait for this not to happen.

30:27.480 --> 30:31.160
Yeah, that would be, that would definitely ruin his parade if he just started naming

30:31.160 --> 30:32.160
FBI agents.

30:32.160 --> 30:33.160
Yeah.

30:33.160 --> 30:37.800
So Nick Fuentes is incredibly annoying, and I find him insufferable to listen to.

30:37.800 --> 30:39.000
I love him so much.

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
He's not talking about being banned from flying at this point.

30:43.000 --> 30:48.140
But he is talking about how this, January 6th, unravels.

30:48.140 --> 30:51.240
And when it unravels, everything comes with it.

30:51.240 --> 30:55.600
It's like that sweater song by the Weezer, right?

30:55.600 --> 30:56.600
Weezer.

30:56.600 --> 30:57.600
Ah.

30:57.600 --> 30:58.600
Not a Weezer guy.

30:58.600 --> 30:59.600
No?

30:59.600 --> 31:00.600
No.

31:00.600 --> 31:01.600
You don't know if you want to destroy my sweater?

31:01.600 --> 31:02.600
No, I do not.

31:02.600 --> 31:04.160
Pull this thread as I walk away?

31:04.160 --> 31:05.260
Not a Weezer guy.

31:05.260 --> 31:06.260
Not even Pinkerton.

31:06.260 --> 31:07.260
Wow.

31:07.260 --> 31:10.880
I don't really love them that much either, but I know references.

31:10.880 --> 31:11.880
Well, that's fair.

31:11.880 --> 31:17.160
Anyway, if you want to destroy the globalist sweater, you pull the thread of January 6th

31:17.160 --> 31:18.160
while they walk away.

31:18.160 --> 31:19.160
Gotcha.

31:19.160 --> 31:22.480
What's going to unravel in all of this is the myth of January 6th.

31:22.480 --> 31:28.040
That will unravel the myth of the 2020 election, the Biden landslide.

31:28.040 --> 31:32.440
That will unravel the myth of COVID, which was the pretext to use the mail-in ballots

31:32.440 --> 31:33.960
to rig the election.

31:33.960 --> 31:38.600
It's going to unravel all the events of the entire past one year and how all of this was

31:38.600 --> 31:42.260
culminating in the overthrow of Donald Trump by the deep state.

31:42.260 --> 31:44.800
It was all just a big color revolution.

31:44.800 --> 31:51.000
This is one of those things that is going to, if this comes apart, will unravel a series

31:51.000 --> 31:53.360
of huge, massive lies.

31:53.360 --> 31:58.780
So Nick Fuentes has a unified conspiracy about everything that's happened over the last year

31:58.780 --> 32:00.280
and a half or so.

32:00.280 --> 32:01.280
Cool.

32:01.280 --> 32:02.280
Yeah.

32:02.280 --> 32:03.280
Yeah.

32:03.280 --> 32:04.280
Yeah.

32:04.280 --> 32:05.280
Mm-hmm.

32:05.280 --> 32:06.280
Huh.

32:06.280 --> 32:09.000
So when this goes nowhere, what's his new fucking bullshit?

32:09.000 --> 32:11.360
He'll probably get back to complaining about the airlines.

32:11.360 --> 32:12.360
I know.

32:12.360 --> 32:14.800
I just can't stand this.

32:14.800 --> 32:15.800
I don't know.

32:15.800 --> 32:19.800
He'll just retreat to demographic birth rate nonsense.

32:19.800 --> 32:23.880
Has anybody tried really yelling into his face though?

32:23.880 --> 32:24.880
I'm sure.

32:24.880 --> 32:25.880
Really loudly.

32:25.880 --> 32:26.880
I'm sure.

32:26.880 --> 32:28.760
But just like, no.

32:28.760 --> 32:30.720
Over and over and over and over again.

32:30.720 --> 32:35.800
I know that you think that you have a banshee-like power with your yelling, but I think that

32:35.800 --> 32:39.480
a smug prick like Nick Fuentes is pretty immune to yelling.

32:39.480 --> 32:40.480
All right.

32:40.480 --> 32:41.480
We'll see.

32:41.480 --> 32:47.360
I would assume that throughout his high school career and the few years he's been out of

32:47.360 --> 32:50.240
high school, he's been getting a lot of people yelling at him.

32:50.240 --> 32:51.240
That's probably true.

32:51.240 --> 32:52.240
Yeah.

32:52.240 --> 32:53.240
Oh, God.

32:53.240 --> 32:54.240
He's so easy to hate.

32:54.240 --> 32:55.240
Oh.

32:55.240 --> 32:56.240
He's so easy to hate.

32:56.240 --> 32:57.240
And it only gets easier.

32:57.240 --> 33:01.280
And again, it's globalist interests are going to organize groups into thinking it's OK to

33:01.280 --> 33:04.720
literally attack and overrun and attack white people.

33:04.720 --> 33:06.200
This is the sick Marxist plan.

33:06.200 --> 33:09.680
They're not going to do it according to class or do it according to race.

33:09.680 --> 33:11.200
They admit that.

33:11.200 --> 33:13.440
And so they do.

33:13.440 --> 33:14.440
They do.

33:14.440 --> 33:15.440
And you're right.

33:15.440 --> 33:16.440
That's what's happening in South Africa.

33:16.440 --> 33:19.840
That is what happened in Zimbabwe, formerly Rhodesia.

33:19.840 --> 33:21.880
This is what's happening all across the world.

33:21.880 --> 33:25.360
And you know, people are just going to have to make a really tough decision, which is

33:25.360 --> 33:29.200
what are we willing to do to save our Western civilization?

33:29.200 --> 33:30.920
We were given this great inheritance.

33:30.920 --> 33:31.920
OK.

33:31.920 --> 33:32.920
OK, Nick.

33:32.920 --> 33:37.560
So I love when someone like a Nick Fuentes is like, I'm not racist at all.

33:37.560 --> 33:44.960
And then he starts talking about Western heritage and our great inheritance and how it was squandered.

33:44.960 --> 33:49.720
And the two examples that he has of the squandering of it are South Africa and fucking Rhodesia.

33:49.720 --> 33:50.720
Yeah.

33:50.720 --> 33:51.720
Yeah.

33:51.720 --> 33:52.720
What do those things have in common, Nick?

33:52.720 --> 33:53.720
I can't.

33:53.720 --> 33:54.720
Dumb bastard.

33:54.720 --> 34:00.360
Why would you believe that white people were forced to endure the injustice of continuing

34:00.360 --> 34:04.440
to own 90 percent of South Africa?

34:04.440 --> 34:10.160
I feel like those sorts of moments are real indications that like he's trolling.

34:10.160 --> 34:13.120
Like whenever he's like, I'm not racist.

34:13.120 --> 34:15.440
This is just I just care about America.

34:15.440 --> 34:18.200
Like he he knows he's fucking with people.

34:18.200 --> 34:19.920
Like it's it's outrageous.

34:19.920 --> 34:21.820
Rhodesia means white nationalist.

34:21.820 --> 34:22.820
The end.

34:22.820 --> 34:26.040
He's just being like, hey, here's how Rhodesia should have gone.

34:26.040 --> 34:27.040
We keep it.

34:27.040 --> 34:29.640
Is white nationalist the end?

34:29.640 --> 34:31.940
I mean, there's no other way of putting it.

34:31.940 --> 34:37.040
We believe we should be able to go into a country, take all of their land by force and

34:37.040 --> 34:41.280
violence, and then force them to work for us for nothing.

34:41.280 --> 34:42.280
Yeah.

34:42.280 --> 34:43.280
Yeah.

34:43.280 --> 34:44.280
So anyway, fuck Nick Fuentes.

34:44.280 --> 34:45.280
Fuck Nick Fuentes.

34:45.280 --> 34:46.440
Alex had other guests on this show.

34:46.440 --> 34:49.720
And so I deemed some of this a priority thing.

34:49.720 --> 34:51.240
I got kind of tired of Nick.

34:51.240 --> 34:52.760
They weren't really talking about much.

34:52.760 --> 34:56.640
It was kind of just about how, like, the extreme right is so strong.

34:56.640 --> 34:57.640
Sure.

34:57.640 --> 34:58.640
The system is weak.

34:58.640 --> 35:01.160
And you guys couldn't even overthrow the fucking capital.

35:01.160 --> 35:02.160
All of this.

35:02.160 --> 35:04.400
But they're going to pull that thread and all of this is going to collapse.

35:04.400 --> 35:08.200
The system is done for the right is going to win.

35:08.200 --> 35:09.400
That doesn't sound true.

35:09.400 --> 35:12.480
Alex also has his lawyer Barnes on.

35:12.480 --> 35:14.840
We're not going to listen to any of that because who gives a shit?

35:14.840 --> 35:15.840
Good work, Barnes.

35:15.840 --> 35:16.840
Yeah.

35:16.840 --> 35:17.840
You didn't even make it onto our show.

35:17.840 --> 35:19.560
Nope.

35:19.560 --> 35:21.680
Just bored me.

35:21.680 --> 35:22.680
Try stand up.

35:22.680 --> 35:23.680
Yeah.

35:23.680 --> 35:27.800
Alex also talks to Pete Santilli, who's a guy we've heard a couple of times on the show.

35:27.800 --> 35:32.740
And I heard this and I was like, well, you are disqualified, sir.

35:32.740 --> 35:35.960
So when my dad, when I got out of the Marine Corps, he gave me a sit down.

35:35.960 --> 35:42.440
He was telling me how powerful the the Nazi, you know, a socialist movement was.

35:42.440 --> 35:47.480
And he, in fact, and my dad is not a white supremacist, but he did describe to me historically,

35:47.480 --> 35:52.840
he said it was so powerful that, you know, 99 percent of the people in Germany voted

35:52.840 --> 35:58.240
for Hitler was the people that allowed Hitler to rise to power because of the trinkets that

35:58.240 --> 35:59.240
they offer.

35:59.240 --> 36:03.260
You know, of course, freebies for everyone schooling for everyone.

36:03.260 --> 36:09.240
He said it was so powerful that it was the people that actually propelled Hitler to power.

36:09.240 --> 36:13.240
Firstly, Hitler was very specifically not in favor of universal program.

36:13.240 --> 36:14.640
No, absolutely not.

36:14.640 --> 36:18.720
I'm sure that at no point was he out there advocating for free tuition for everyone,

36:18.720 --> 36:21.360
maybe for Aryans or something, but not for everyone.

36:21.360 --> 36:22.880
I mean, maybe later.

36:22.880 --> 36:23.880
Yeah.

36:23.880 --> 36:27.920
Second, this is an absolute fabrication and lie about how Hitler came to power.

36:27.920 --> 36:30.320
It doesn't matter that this has nothing to do with reality.

36:30.320 --> 36:34.600
This story doesn't exist to convey history and help people understand the world better.

36:34.600 --> 36:39.600
The reason this story exists is to demonize social welfare programs, pure and simple.

36:39.600 --> 36:43.480
Hitler didn't become chancellor because he and the Nazis offered everyone trinkets.

36:43.480 --> 36:49.360
He'd run for president against Hindenburg in 1932 and he got 36.8% of the vote and afterwards

36:49.360 --> 36:53.520
he was appointed chancellor as part of an attempt to create a coalition government that

36:53.520 --> 36:57.520
would tamp down the Nazi movement from getting out of control, but more importantly, make

36:57.520 --> 37:00.440
sure that the communists stayed far away from power.

37:00.440 --> 37:01.440
Yeah.

37:01.440 --> 37:02.440
Worked out.

37:02.440 --> 37:05.320
By the time of the Reichstag fire and the enabling act, the only people in government

37:05.320 --> 37:09.640
who were opposing Hitler were the left leaning social Democrats and probably the communists

37:09.640 --> 37:12.280
would have, but they weren't in the Reichstag anymore.

37:12.280 --> 37:13.280
Nope.

37:13.280 --> 37:16.240
And Pete Santilli tells this story because he wants everyone listening to think that

37:16.240 --> 37:20.140
if you have a politician talking about expanding Medicare or social security, the next thing

37:20.140 --> 37:22.520
they're going to do is set up concentration camps.

37:22.520 --> 37:23.520
It's total bullshit.

37:23.520 --> 37:25.000
He's just against public spending.

37:25.000 --> 37:30.400
That's like, it's just a desperate attempt to make that argument based on nothing.

37:30.400 --> 37:37.440
And just one of the subtlest things in it is that 99% number of just like, it is easy

37:37.440 --> 37:43.040
and it is right to demonize everyone that disagrees with you.

37:43.040 --> 37:46.760
99% of them will be taken in by trinkets.

37:46.760 --> 37:49.360
They're not even people smart enough to wake up.

37:49.360 --> 37:50.600
They can't.

37:50.600 --> 37:51.600
Trinkets are all they need.

37:51.600 --> 37:56.360
So it's fine to obliterate them just like you wanted to the Nazis.

37:56.360 --> 37:57.360
Yep.

37:57.360 --> 37:58.360
Yep.

37:58.360 --> 38:00.800
So anyway, fuck Pete Santilli too.

38:00.800 --> 38:06.600
This emergency report really was about one thing for me.

38:06.600 --> 38:11.280
I don't care about Alex's ideas that the January 6th is a false flag.

38:11.280 --> 38:12.280
Yeah.

38:12.280 --> 38:13.280
I don't care about Nick Fuentes.

38:13.280 --> 38:14.280
No.

38:14.280 --> 38:15.920
I don't care about Barnes and I don't care about Pete Santilli.

38:15.920 --> 38:16.920
All of them.

38:16.920 --> 38:18.040
I care about one thing.

38:18.040 --> 38:19.040
Mike down.

38:19.040 --> 38:24.160
Well, he's one of our most popular guests and he is back by demand.

38:24.160 --> 38:27.640
Dr. Steve Puchenik is a best selling author.

38:27.640 --> 38:28.640
Yes.

38:28.640 --> 38:31.640
You're a witch.

38:31.640 --> 38:34.480
You were saying last week we were talking after the show.

38:34.480 --> 38:37.280
You were like, man, I've been, I'm missing Steve.

38:37.280 --> 38:39.000
I've been needing a big swing.

38:39.000 --> 38:42.560
But I also was saying that I feel Steve coming back.

38:42.560 --> 38:43.560
He's coming.

38:43.560 --> 38:45.640
It's around the corner.

38:45.640 --> 38:51.880
Even when Alex and him had the falling out about his ridiculous predictions around the

38:51.880 --> 38:56.280
election, I still was like, alright, he's on time out.

38:56.280 --> 38:57.280
He'll be back.

38:57.280 --> 38:58.280
He'll be back.

38:58.280 --> 38:59.280
And here we are.

38:59.280 --> 39:00.280
Here we are in June.

39:00.280 --> 39:01.280
Steve is back.

39:01.280 --> 39:03.240
So as far as the bet went.

39:03.240 --> 39:07.680
He made the soft landing into Owen's show.

39:07.680 --> 39:11.960
He started coming back on the war room a little bit and then that was the way to get the toe

39:11.960 --> 39:12.960
in the water.

39:12.960 --> 39:16.640
But the thing that I find really interesting about that clip is that Alex is like, by popular

39:16.640 --> 39:18.600
demand, Steve Puchenik is back.

39:18.600 --> 39:21.120
I think he might have gotten bullied into having Steve back on.

39:21.120 --> 39:23.000
It does kind of seem like it.

39:23.000 --> 39:27.560
And they let him go on Owen's show as like, hey, listen, if you can prove you can stay

39:27.560 --> 39:31.200
on target on this show, then we'll give you that.

39:31.200 --> 39:32.800
Or if it's not too humiliating.

39:32.800 --> 39:33.800
Yeah, exactly.

39:33.800 --> 39:35.240
It's so great.

39:35.240 --> 39:37.040
What a fucking kid gloves.

39:37.040 --> 39:41.440
He's too popular to get rid of completely, but I hate him so much.

39:41.440 --> 39:46.480
I gotta say that if there were a guest that we had, like if we had guests and there was

39:46.480 --> 39:50.960
a guest we had who was really, really popular, but also was a complete dick and was using

39:50.960 --> 39:54.720
us and lying to everybody, I wouldn't care how popular they were.

39:54.720 --> 39:56.960
They would not be on my show ever again.

39:56.960 --> 39:57.960
No.

39:57.960 --> 40:02.640
And if we had people being like, no, you got to have him back on the show, we'd be like,

40:02.640 --> 40:04.960
we will not be having him back on the show.

40:04.960 --> 40:05.960
End of conversation.

40:05.960 --> 40:07.920
I mean, you should stop listening because you like that guy.

40:07.920 --> 40:09.720
If you like it, goodbye.

40:09.720 --> 40:10.720
Yeah.

40:10.720 --> 40:11.720
Yeah.

40:11.720 --> 40:13.200
What integrity Alex has.

40:13.200 --> 40:15.360
He's just one of the heroes of our time.

40:15.360 --> 40:16.560
Tip of the spear.

40:16.560 --> 40:17.560
Undoubtedly.

40:17.560 --> 40:18.560
Uh huh.

40:18.560 --> 40:23.520
So Alex let Steve speak his piece and this to me is Steve declaring victory over Ithra

40:23.520 --> 40:24.520
Wars.

40:24.520 --> 40:26.720
It's always a pleasure, Alex.

40:26.720 --> 40:31.520
Always remember you and I are the focus of the rage of the left and particularly when

40:31.520 --> 40:35.660
you have what we call liberal fascism.

40:35.660 --> 40:40.540
This is what you're beginning to see with the Biden administration, with Susan Rice,

40:40.540 --> 40:44.120
with Obama, uh, Biden isn't running anything.

40:44.120 --> 40:45.520
He had three aneurysm.

40:45.520 --> 40:47.680
He's cognitively impaired.

40:47.680 --> 40:49.440
There's a demand for him to take a test.

40:49.440 --> 40:54.320
The real issue now is that we are in the midst of a military coup.

40:54.320 --> 40:56.480
I said it to you a year and a half ago.

40:56.480 --> 40:58.960
We were those watermark balance buddy computers.

40:58.960 --> 41:00.660
We marked the balance.

41:00.660 --> 41:02.420
We know exactly who's corrupt.

41:02.420 --> 41:07.160
We know where the corruption is occurring and what you're seeing is the federal government

41:07.160 --> 41:08.920
trying to hold on.

41:08.920 --> 41:13.720
So now by popular demand, Alex has to have Steve back on and Steve isn't budging on the

41:13.720 --> 41:14.720
watermark balance.

41:14.720 --> 41:15.720
Nope.

41:15.720 --> 41:16.720
Nope.

41:16.720 --> 41:17.720
They made the bet.

41:17.720 --> 41:20.880
He lost the bet and still going for it.

41:20.880 --> 41:24.520
Well he's going to mold reality in such a way as to win the bet.

41:24.520 --> 41:26.120
What an asshole.

41:26.120 --> 41:31.340
What a, that, I mean, I can totally understand why Alex hates him.

41:31.340 --> 41:38.520
Like on a deep level because that is a narcissistic psychopath fighting a narcissistic psychopath

41:38.520 --> 41:42.080
and losing your reality to his.

41:42.080 --> 41:43.080
That's brutal.

41:43.080 --> 41:49.800
But one of the, like it's, it's two narcissistic psychopaths, but one is way better at manipulating

41:49.800 --> 41:50.800
people.

41:50.800 --> 41:51.800
Yeah.

41:51.800 --> 41:52.800
Yeah.

41:52.800 --> 41:53.800
Yeah.

41:53.800 --> 41:54.800
He's a pro.

41:54.800 --> 41:55.800
He's a real pro and Alex is an easy mark.

41:55.800 --> 41:57.640
So you, you might have some doubts about watermark ballots.

41:57.640 --> 41:59.280
I have plenty of them.

41:59.280 --> 42:01.920
You should let those doubts go to bed.

42:01.920 --> 42:02.920
Okay.

42:02.920 --> 42:04.720
We've marked the computers.

42:04.720 --> 42:05.960
We've marked the ballot.

42:05.960 --> 42:12.980
We Steve crypto engraving and it was a sophisticated engraving.

42:12.980 --> 42:19.680
This was a sting operation run by many of our military intelligence, civilian intelligence,

42:19.680 --> 42:25.440
key selected PRI people who knew that we were having a corrupt government and they were

42:25.440 --> 42:26.880
tired of war.

42:26.880 --> 42:31.840
And we went on your show to basically pronounce that and make that announcement clear to the

42:31.840 --> 42:39.960
American public because you became the one source that was reliable, valid, and important

42:39.960 --> 42:43.240
to our institution.

42:43.240 --> 42:49.980
I am going to say a bunch of shit directly to your face that you know is not true and

42:49.980 --> 42:52.040
have told me is not true.

42:52.040 --> 42:56.440
And then I'm going to compliment you for it at the end that went from compliment as a

42:56.440 --> 43:02.720
way of buttering you up to compliment as the knife stuck deep into your gut and then twist

43:02.720 --> 43:04.360
it around as a weapon.

43:04.360 --> 43:06.360
Oh, that is good stuff.

43:06.360 --> 43:07.360
Yeah.

43:07.360 --> 43:12.260
Cause in order to stand up for your dignity, uh, disagreeing with the bullshit I'm saying,

43:12.260 --> 43:16.560
you would have to disagree with the compliment praise God.

43:16.560 --> 43:18.080
That's so evil.

43:18.080 --> 43:19.580
That's evil.

43:19.580 --> 43:20.580
That's just so good.

43:20.580 --> 43:24.000
So Steve's got another prediction here and it's a, I don't, I don't think this is a good

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
one.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.280
I think that the Democrats won't exist within a few months.

43:27.280 --> 43:28.280
Oh, that'll be tough.

43:28.280 --> 43:34.920
What you're seeing is the eruption of a party that will no longer exist within a few more

43:34.920 --> 43:35.920
months.

43:35.920 --> 43:39.720
They sound as if they're going to be successful, but they're not at all.

43:39.720 --> 43:43.560
So I'll give them, I'll just to be generous to Steve, I'll give them till the end of the

43:43.560 --> 43:44.560
year.

43:44.560 --> 43:51.560
So the democratic party exists, but the beginning of 2022 Steve will once again be incorrect.

43:51.560 --> 43:56.240
I mean, I'll say, I would say I have to, I'll, I'll stop it at about halfway through the

43:56.240 --> 43:57.920
campaign season.

43:57.920 --> 43:58.920
You know what I'm saying?

43:58.920 --> 44:03.840
Whenever the democratic congressmen are still are going back for their next house of representatives,

44:03.840 --> 44:08.240
the senators are up for, uh, that's past a few months.

44:08.240 --> 44:11.120
Well, I'm, I'm trying to be as generous as possible.

44:11.120 --> 44:13.360
I feel like given six months is pretty generous.

44:13.360 --> 44:14.360
That's true.

44:14.360 --> 44:19.440
But I mean, you know, you gotta at least see if the Democrats campaign before they're eradicated

44:19.440 --> 44:20.440
completely.

44:20.440 --> 44:21.440
Maybe they, yeah, I don't know.

44:21.440 --> 44:23.920
This is all bullshit, but super bullshit.

44:23.920 --> 44:28.440
So Alex has this big talking point that he throws out a bunch that Trump has come out

44:28.440 --> 44:32.680
and he said, we're going to win back a Congress and maybe even the presidency before you,

44:32.680 --> 44:36.240
before you expect it, you know, like, no, that's probably true.

44:36.240 --> 44:40.560
Well, Alex asks Steve, why did Trump say that stuff?

44:40.560 --> 44:42.720
And Steve's got an interesting answer.

44:42.720 --> 44:46.440
What about the amazing statement by Trump two weeks ago where he said, we're going to

44:46.440 --> 44:49.700
win the house, we're going to win the Senate and we're going to win the presidency a lot

44:49.700 --> 44:53.240
sooner than you think, basically saying Joe Biden would be gone.

44:53.240 --> 44:59.960
And now you see prestigious Democrat doctor saying he needs to step down, all the evidence

44:59.960 --> 45:02.880
of election fraud and the proof coming out.

45:02.880 --> 45:06.320
And I look at the body language of Garland and of others.

45:06.320 --> 45:08.140
They look like deer in the headlights.

45:08.140 --> 45:13.100
So can you lay out for us what you thought was going to happen on January six versus

45:13.100 --> 45:17.900
what's happened, but what's then now unfolding right now and what, what do you think Trump's

45:17.900 --> 45:20.560
cryptic statement meant?

45:20.560 --> 45:26.220
What Trump's statement meant was simply to say that he knew and was aware in part talk

45:26.220 --> 45:32.480
of the fact that we in the military and in the intelligence community selected a certain

45:32.480 --> 45:37.440
number of people to be involved in what we call the sting operation, where we put water

45:37.440 --> 45:43.880
marks and encrypted code on the machines, the voting machines and all the ballots.

45:43.880 --> 45:45.140
So Trump is in on it.

45:45.140 --> 45:46.680
That is so good.

45:46.680 --> 45:47.680
That is so good.

45:47.680 --> 45:53.160
Alex gave him that subtle, like what you thought back then.

45:53.160 --> 45:57.520
Tell us what you think now as though they were going to be different.

45:57.520 --> 45:58.520
Nope.

45:58.520 --> 45:59.520
Nope.

45:59.520 --> 46:00.520
Same bullshit.

46:00.520 --> 46:01.520
Yeah.

46:01.520 --> 46:06.520
Alex is also giving some signal to like, Hey, you know, they, uh, it turns out you maybe

46:06.520 --> 46:08.520
were right about all that stuff.

46:08.520 --> 46:09.520
Maybe I was wrong.

46:09.520 --> 46:10.520
Yeah.

46:10.520 --> 46:13.000
Like that's such a sub they're submitting.

46:13.000 --> 46:14.000
Yeah.

46:14.000 --> 46:15.000
Yeah.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
Yep.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.000
Yep.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
Yeah.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
Yeah.

46:19.000 --> 46:22.320
One of the, one of the things that might come into your mind is like, okay, so they ran

46:22.320 --> 46:23.320
this big sting operation.

46:23.320 --> 46:25.600
Obviously there's going to be some guilty parties.

46:25.600 --> 46:26.600
Sure.

46:26.600 --> 46:27.600
I got it.

46:27.600 --> 46:28.600
Yeah.

46:28.600 --> 46:29.600
Somebody has got to be in prison, right?

46:29.600 --> 46:30.600
Secret indictments.

46:30.600 --> 46:35.880
Well then what we call the sting operation where we put watermarks and encrypted code

46:35.880 --> 46:40.640
on the machines, the voting machines and all the ballots in the process.

46:40.640 --> 46:45.800
We understood that there would be a lot of people implicated, indicted and convicted

46:45.800 --> 46:51.160
and sent not to the prisons in America, but to our prisons in Guantanamo.

46:51.160 --> 46:56.840
We built a whole new facility a year ago using new wiring, not in the old Guantanamo, but

46:56.840 --> 46:59.480
in the mountains of Guantanamo.

46:59.480 --> 47:03.840
Many of these people have been sent down without any notice to anybody else.

47:03.840 --> 47:04.840
What?

47:04.840 --> 47:05.840
Yeah.

47:05.840 --> 47:07.980
So apparently a bunch of people are secretly in Guantanamo now.

47:07.980 --> 47:10.080
So this is just QAnon stuff.

47:10.080 --> 47:13.380
There's a bunch of white collar bureaucrats.

47:13.380 --> 47:17.880
They forced to go to a mountain stronghold prison in Guantanamo?

47:17.880 --> 47:18.880
And probably the Pope.

47:18.880 --> 47:20.480
And probably the real Pope.

47:20.480 --> 47:21.480
Yeah.

47:21.480 --> 47:22.480
That's probably true.

47:22.480 --> 47:23.480
Oh man.

47:23.480 --> 47:24.480
Yep.

47:24.480 --> 47:25.480
I don't want to go to that prison.

47:25.480 --> 47:26.480
No.

47:26.480 --> 47:27.480
No, that sounds terrible.

47:27.480 --> 47:32.200
So Steve gets talking about January 6th and essentially what it is is a Pelosi Merrick

47:32.200 --> 47:34.440
Garland false flag or something.

47:34.440 --> 47:35.540
Just doesn't sound true.

47:35.540 --> 47:40.820
It's not, but what's more important, listen to Steve spin his wheels while trying to describe

47:40.820 --> 47:41.820
Merrick Garland.

47:41.820 --> 47:46.880
Mike down for this, I really want you to pay attention to this cause it's, it's outrageous.

47:46.880 --> 47:53.600
And this is once again, Nancy Pelosi agreeing to have this type of false flag using another

47:53.600 --> 47:58.820
one of our Washington based quote, attorney generals Garland.

47:58.820 --> 48:02.640
It's a full Garland went to a school called Andover.

48:02.640 --> 48:09.420
He was a little prep school from a wasp family in New York, then went to Yale and then went

48:09.420 --> 48:17.540
to a prestigious law firm where he only earned a $9 million in one case and is worth between

48:17.540 --> 48:22.180
about 16 million to 24 million.

48:22.180 --> 48:27.440
Never having served our country, never having built a business, never having to take a risk

48:27.440 --> 48:29.340
like you and I have.

48:29.340 --> 48:31.500
So basic, Oh, Garland, I'm sorry.

48:31.500 --> 48:32.700
It's the Jewish guy.

48:32.700 --> 48:33.700
It's the other guy.

48:33.700 --> 48:35.540
Uh, no, that's, yeah.

48:35.540 --> 48:41.120
He's the Jewish guy who also went ironically to Harvard, also went to Harvard undergraduate

48:41.120 --> 48:43.680
of Harvard, the, uh, law school.

48:43.680 --> 48:46.620
Steve got the memorized bio for Merrick Garland wrong.

48:46.620 --> 48:47.620
Yeah.

48:47.620 --> 48:50.060
I was going to say that doesn't sound right at all.

48:50.060 --> 48:54.780
No, he's just, yeah, I mean he has these like little bits of a little information that he's

48:54.780 --> 48:56.900
memorized about folks to throw out.

48:56.900 --> 49:01.420
But you also notice that like the things that he sort of hinges on are like, he's a wasp,

49:01.420 --> 49:02.620
he's a Jewish guy.

49:02.620 --> 49:03.620
Like weird.

49:03.620 --> 49:04.620
Yep.

49:04.620 --> 49:09.980
You got to know what people are before you can build an opinion about them, Dan.

49:09.980 --> 49:10.980
That makes perfect sense.

49:10.980 --> 49:11.980
Seems to be what Steve.

49:11.980 --> 49:16.580
That's what Steve believes and uh, that's cause he's a giant fucking white nationalist

49:16.580 --> 49:17.580
racist.

49:17.580 --> 49:18.580
Boy.

49:18.580 --> 49:19.580
Yeah.

49:19.580 --> 49:20.580
And scary.

49:20.580 --> 49:21.580
Like terrifying.

49:21.580 --> 49:24.420
If he actually believes the things that he's saying, he is so scary.

49:24.420 --> 49:28.860
He is, he is, he, Oh God, people should be chasing him with butterfly nets.

49:28.860 --> 49:30.500
No, no, absolutely.

49:30.500 --> 49:33.580
He should be in a Hannibal Lecter mask 100%.

49:33.580 --> 49:34.580
Yeah.

49:34.580 --> 49:39.540
So Steve gets to talking about how the Democrats are done, but shows the GOP because Trump

49:39.540 --> 49:42.380
has now created a new, better party.

49:42.380 --> 49:45.860
And his reasoning for this is strange.

49:45.860 --> 49:51.140
What you're seeing is the end of a political party, the so-called Democrats.

49:51.140 --> 49:58.300
In turn, we will end the Republican party as we know it because Trump came in as a black

49:58.300 --> 50:01.220
sheep in the dynamics of politics.

50:01.220 --> 50:08.340
In other words, he was so far out that we, the people understood that we needed a businessman

50:08.340 --> 50:14.700
to come in and no longer politician as Vladimir Putin said it correctly when he saw Biden

50:14.700 --> 50:19.620
or if he did see Biden, he said, look, Biden is nothing more than the political hack who's

50:19.620 --> 50:22.400
been around for 43 years.

50:22.400 --> 50:30.700
What I need is a man who has character, personality, and is able to take the risks that I, Putin

50:30.700 --> 50:33.620
have taken before in running Russia.

50:33.620 --> 50:37.580
So yeah, apparently Biden's a bad president because Putin doesn't like him.

50:37.580 --> 50:45.860
You know, it's really weird in 2021 to listen to just out and out fascists talk, fascistly,

50:45.860 --> 50:50.820
you know, where you're like, I don't remember people being so openly fascist back in the

50:50.820 --> 50:51.820
day.

50:51.820 --> 50:55.920
Maybe I just wasn't paying attention, but as a kid, I don't remember like just hearing

50:55.920 --> 50:58.140
all these fascist talk all the fascist time.

50:58.140 --> 51:04.220
I do feel like this is more overt than even, I remember some of the really fascist.

51:04.220 --> 51:05.220
Yeah.

51:05.220 --> 51:09.420
I mean, and, and like just even on, you know, putting that aside, think about how overt

51:09.420 --> 51:15.220
like this conversation about an ongoing military coup to overthrow the government is like,

51:15.220 --> 51:16.740
and banal too.

51:16.740 --> 51:21.100
Steve is almost sort of like gleefully just discussing like, ah, we're, we're overthrowing

51:21.100 --> 51:22.100
the government.

51:22.100 --> 51:23.660
It's all over this point.

51:23.660 --> 51:29.020
We're basically cleaning out what I call the lavage of 21.

51:29.020 --> 51:36.900
This is a political lavage of America, both Republicans and Democrats explain what a political

51:36.900 --> 51:43.260
lavage is for those of us that didn't live in France.

51:43.260 --> 51:45.960
A political lavage basic.

51:45.960 --> 51:51.540
I'm using a fancy term that I created to make sure that the American people understands

51:51.540 --> 51:54.900
we're basically cleaning out the system.

51:54.900 --> 51:59.360
An alternative term for that was a coup or regime change.

51:59.360 --> 52:04.940
When I came on your show and I explained that I had the right to say publicly that we were

52:04.940 --> 52:10.980
in the midst and the beginning of a military coup, which was a sting operation, I wasn't

52:10.980 --> 52:15.100
coming to the forefront and saying something that I wasn't allowed to say.

52:15.100 --> 52:16.100
Yeah.

52:16.100 --> 52:23.440
I mean, he's got a lavage going on or if you don't know what Steve's own made up political

52:23.440 --> 52:26.820
term is, it's a coup.

52:26.820 --> 52:31.580
I was going to say coup, but I said a different word to make everybody think that I'm super

52:31.580 --> 52:37.420
smart, but instead I just made up a term, which makes me look like a complete asshole.

52:37.420 --> 52:38.420
Yeah.

52:38.420 --> 52:42.900
I mean, you know, he's got an ongoing military coup on his hands and that seems like a lot.

52:42.900 --> 52:44.100
That seems like a lot.

52:44.100 --> 52:48.060
But Steve's team, they're in deep.

52:48.060 --> 52:49.060
They're everywhere.

52:49.060 --> 52:51.340
It does seem like that, dude.

52:51.340 --> 52:53.020
This is a big revelation.

52:53.020 --> 52:56.860
If true, which it's not, this is a huge deal.

52:56.860 --> 53:05.100
We in the, uh, well, we outside the administration, some of them are famous generals, uh, Keith

53:05.100 --> 53:07.300
Alexander's one he's on Amazon.

53:07.300 --> 53:08.680
We threw out Bezos.

53:08.680 --> 53:11.880
He's head of the chairman of the board at what?

53:11.880 --> 53:18.100
But the reason we took over Amazon was we wanted a cloud, a civilian clown, the largest

53:18.100 --> 53:19.100
cloud.

53:19.100 --> 53:23.660
In turn, we placed in a four star general Nakasone third generation nice side.

53:23.660 --> 53:25.620
You are out of your fucking mind.

53:25.620 --> 53:26.620
Front.

53:26.620 --> 53:28.340
He was in cyber command.

53:28.340 --> 53:31.000
We put him into the white house.

53:31.000 --> 53:38.040
So what we did was to take over this administration and allow it to play out in a car in their

53:38.040 --> 53:46.140
own corruption, in their own, uh, miscreant, uh, a way, because we knew that everything

53:46.140 --> 53:52.380
they were about to do would be either ignorant, corrupt, and dangerous to the United States.

53:52.380 --> 53:54.300
Well, let me tell you what that's crazy.

53:54.300 --> 53:55.300
What you're saying?

53:55.300 --> 53:59.180
ZZ won't even talk to Biden or any administration.

53:59.180 --> 54:00.180
They won't even talk to him.

54:00.180 --> 54:01.180
Like they're scared.

54:01.180 --> 54:02.620
Like they know it's a trap.

54:02.620 --> 54:08.360
Steve has a little team and they've taken over Amazon and the government.

54:08.360 --> 54:09.360
It's amazing.

54:09.360 --> 54:11.340
This is, that's a big swing.

54:11.340 --> 54:12.340
Yeah.

54:12.340 --> 54:13.340
Oh yeah.

54:13.340 --> 54:14.340
That's a big swing.

54:14.340 --> 54:19.660
You know, you come to Steve for a big swing and we overthrew Amazon first, not the swing

54:19.660 --> 54:21.240
I was expecting, but that's a big one.

54:21.240 --> 54:22.280
They needed the cloud.

54:22.280 --> 54:24.460
That biggest company in the world thing.

54:24.460 --> 54:26.060
We stole it.

54:26.060 --> 54:27.620
We commandeered it.

54:27.620 --> 54:30.420
Bezos, get out of here.

54:30.420 --> 54:35.820
If Alex took that seriously for a fucking second, he would have to be like, all right,

54:35.820 --> 54:38.860
Steve, fix all that shit that I complain about Amazon all the time.

54:38.860 --> 54:39.860
Totally.

54:39.860 --> 54:40.860
Totally.

54:40.860 --> 54:41.860
Why then?

54:41.860 --> 54:42.860
Why aren't you guys doing anything right?

54:42.860 --> 54:43.860
Yeah.

54:43.860 --> 54:45.460
You're military owned now or whatever.

54:45.460 --> 54:46.460
Nonsense.

54:46.460 --> 54:47.460
Yeah.

54:47.460 --> 54:51.780
Um, so one of the things that Steve wants you to know though is like, okay, so like,

54:51.780 --> 54:56.180
look, there's, there appear to be some frosty relations between Biden and China.

54:56.180 --> 54:57.180
Sure.

54:57.180 --> 54:58.180
Right?

54:58.180 --> 54:59.180
Yeah.

54:59.180 --> 55:00.180
Doesn't seem like things are maybe as amicable.

55:00.180 --> 55:01.180
It's fine.

55:01.180 --> 55:02.180
Not great.

55:02.180 --> 55:03.180
Yeah.

55:03.180 --> 55:04.180
But what?

55:04.180 --> 55:05.180
It's fine.

55:05.180 --> 55:06.180
Okay.

55:06.180 --> 55:07.180
It's fine.

55:07.180 --> 55:08.180
Well that's good.

55:08.180 --> 55:09.180
Because Steve talked to China.

55:09.180 --> 55:10.180
No, no, no, no, no.

55:10.180 --> 55:16.500
But the key point here was that Gigi ping understood that Biden was not in control.

55:16.500 --> 55:21.680
I had sent him a message with the approval of my people a year and a half ago that this

55:21.680 --> 55:23.740
was not relevant to China.

55:23.740 --> 55:26.940
We would remain, remain friends of China.

55:26.940 --> 55:32.700
At the same time, we sent a message to Modi of India to say, we are your friends as well.

55:32.700 --> 55:33.700
Yeah.

55:33.700 --> 55:37.020
So Steve's in touch with, uh, uh, she and, uh, Modi.

55:37.020 --> 55:38.020
Wow.

55:38.020 --> 55:41.900
I feel like Steve is more involved now than he was in the past.

55:41.900 --> 55:42.900
Oh yeah.

55:42.900 --> 55:47.940
I feel like now Steve has gone from being like, I'm part of an operation to being like,

55:47.940 --> 55:49.740
I'm running this shit.

55:49.740 --> 55:53.740
I think, I think it's an escalation that comes with knowing that you're untouchable.

55:53.740 --> 55:54.740
Yeah.

55:54.740 --> 55:55.740
Yeah.

55:55.740 --> 55:56.740
Yeah.

55:56.740 --> 55:57.740
You're untouchable.

55:57.740 --> 56:02.700
So why not go ahead and create yourself as like this arch super villain slash hero, I

56:02.700 --> 56:05.500
guess, depending on perspective, why not?

56:05.500 --> 56:09.760
And he's using we and you think he's, he's talking about his team, but part of me is

56:09.760 --> 56:14.860
like, we're at the Royal we level of him describing himself, you know, at this point you can get

56:14.860 --> 56:16.260
away with whatever you want.

56:16.260 --> 56:20.620
You've got Alex basically dead to rights on everything.

56:20.620 --> 56:23.700
You can just, he's not going to put up a fight about anything.

56:23.700 --> 56:28.020
He fired David Knight, kicked you off the show for a few months and now he's forced

56:28.020 --> 56:29.020
to have you back.

56:29.020 --> 56:30.020
Ooh.

56:30.020 --> 56:31.020
Like you could get away with whatever you want.

56:31.020 --> 56:32.020
Why not?

56:32.020 --> 56:33.020
Just legend build.

56:33.020 --> 56:34.020
Yeah.

56:34.020 --> 56:35.500
Alex passed a yes and you.

56:35.500 --> 56:36.500
Oh man.

56:36.500 --> 56:38.660
But Jesus, this is so big.

56:38.660 --> 56:41.500
I control all the levers of power in the world.

56:41.500 --> 56:45.700
I told, I told China put up with Biden.

56:45.700 --> 56:46.700
It's cool.

56:46.700 --> 56:51.080
You know, like there's that big lie theory that he's operating on with Alex now.

56:51.080 --> 56:52.080
This is too big.

56:52.080 --> 56:53.620
This is too big of a lie.

56:53.620 --> 56:55.160
This is just too big.

56:55.160 --> 56:58.100
But I did notice there that he pronounced it Gigi ping.

56:58.100 --> 56:59.100
Yes.

56:59.100 --> 57:01.180
And that makes me think that that's why Alex pronounces it that way.

57:01.180 --> 57:02.180
That would make sense.

57:02.180 --> 57:03.180
Probably from talking to Steve.

57:03.180 --> 57:04.540
Too much.

57:04.540 --> 57:07.980
Which is how much anybody who ever speaks to Steve talks to Steve.

57:07.980 --> 57:08.980
Sure.

57:08.980 --> 57:09.980
Yeah.

57:09.980 --> 57:10.980
Don't talk to that dude.

57:10.980 --> 57:11.980
Don't talk to him.

57:11.980 --> 57:12.980
Just don't talk to him.

57:12.980 --> 57:15.780
So Steve was talking about how like they've taken over Amazon and they also took over

57:15.780 --> 57:19.740
the government and they took over the Biden administration essentially in order to let

57:19.740 --> 57:21.940
it play out its corrupt ways.

57:21.940 --> 57:22.940
Sure.

57:22.940 --> 57:26.540
And that's because they wanted to show the world that this is all corrupt.

57:26.540 --> 57:27.540
Right?

57:27.540 --> 57:28.540
Yeah.

57:28.540 --> 57:29.540
So they had to let it happen.

57:29.540 --> 57:30.540
See.

57:30.540 --> 57:31.540
That's a bad plan.

57:31.540 --> 57:32.540
If Trump had won.

57:32.540 --> 57:33.540
Right.

57:33.540 --> 57:37.660
Then, you know, maybe you get a little bit done, but if Trump loses, it shows how corrupt

57:37.660 --> 57:38.660
everything is.

57:38.660 --> 57:39.660
Right.

57:39.660 --> 57:40.660
You get even more done.

57:40.660 --> 57:41.660
Right.

57:41.660 --> 57:42.660
It's, it's brilliant.

57:42.660 --> 57:43.660
No, that's a bad plan.

57:43.660 --> 57:44.660
Brilliant.

57:44.660 --> 57:45.660
No, that's a bad plan.

57:45.660 --> 57:46.660
Brilliant.

57:46.660 --> 57:47.660
I know you think you're playing the long game, but that's a bad plan.

57:47.660 --> 57:48.660
It's brilliant.

57:48.660 --> 57:49.660
All right.

57:49.660 --> 57:50.660
Well, we'll see.

57:50.660 --> 57:51.660
And that's all Trump was trying to do, man.

57:51.660 --> 57:52.660
Okay.

57:52.660 --> 57:54.180
I mean, it shows the world that things weren't good.

57:54.180 --> 57:55.700
That doesn't sound true.

57:55.700 --> 58:02.100
What happens is you enter self-destruction and that's what Washington was all about.

58:02.100 --> 58:05.180
And that's what Trump was trying to show the people.

58:05.180 --> 58:09.900
And those of us who worked in Washington, but no longer live there, trying to show the

58:09.900 --> 58:17.900
American people how incompetent, corrupt, and disgraceful these, uh, these people, politicians

58:17.900 --> 58:23.940
were the Mitt Romney, a Mormon from Utah, yet he was a governor of Massachusetts.

58:23.940 --> 58:24.940
Now he's a Senator.

58:24.940 --> 58:25.940
No, no, no.

58:25.940 --> 58:27.520
Undoubtedly, they're all incompetent.

58:27.520 --> 58:33.700
Here's what I'm asking you is listen, a blind hog gets eggers twice a day, broken clocks

58:33.700 --> 58:35.140
are right twice a day.

58:35.140 --> 58:36.780
I love hearing all this confidence.

58:36.780 --> 58:39.820
It's wonderful for radio TV.

58:39.820 --> 58:45.660
They're now saying there are secret watermarks, 3d holograms on the ballots.

58:45.660 --> 58:48.020
And now I see certified experts.

58:48.020 --> 58:49.020
It's true.

58:49.020 --> 58:50.020
They're not.

58:50.020 --> 58:51.020
Oh no, Alex.

58:51.020 --> 58:52.020
Oh man.

58:52.020 --> 58:53.020
Oh, you loser.

58:53.020 --> 58:54.020
Oh, see, this is what I'm saying.

58:54.020 --> 58:58.420
Don't you dare tell me that Alex could help overthrow the fucking Capitol.

58:58.420 --> 59:02.420
Steve Pagenik made him turn into a little baby dog.

59:02.420 --> 59:03.420
Pathetic.

59:03.420 --> 59:08.500
Steve, Alex could actually help a fake overthrow of the government.

59:08.500 --> 59:09.500
Totally.

59:09.500 --> 59:10.500
Yeah.

59:10.500 --> 59:11.500
No, it'd be great.

59:11.500 --> 59:12.500
In the war of the world's radio play.

59:12.500 --> 59:13.500
Right.

59:13.500 --> 59:14.500
Right.

59:14.500 --> 59:15.500
Right.

59:15.500 --> 59:16.500
Right.

59:16.500 --> 59:17.500
This is a little silly.

59:17.500 --> 59:21.300
So Steve wants you to know that the, this is really actually a good thing that's going

59:21.300 --> 59:22.300
on.

59:22.300 --> 59:28.380
The intelligence community, it's all getting cleansed and Alex is like, he's all worried

59:28.380 --> 59:30.780
for his own safety and Steve's like, you're fine.

59:30.780 --> 59:31.780
Of course.

59:31.780 --> 59:32.780
You're fine.

59:32.780 --> 59:33.780
Of course.

59:33.780 --> 59:37.100
This is far more of a cleansing than anybody realizes.

59:37.100 --> 59:38.460
Will you be harmed?

59:38.460 --> 59:39.460
No.

59:39.460 --> 59:40.740
Are they dangerous?

59:40.740 --> 59:41.740
Could be.

59:41.740 --> 59:43.140
Will they hurt you?

59:43.140 --> 59:44.140
No.

59:44.140 --> 59:47.940
Will Obama come back and write another nonsensical book?

59:47.940 --> 59:48.940
Yes.

59:48.940 --> 59:49.940
That's what they gave them.

59:49.940 --> 59:50.940
What is happening?

59:50.940 --> 59:53.820
He was brought on Netflix, a dying Institute.

59:53.820 --> 59:55.420
What happened in the process?

59:55.420 --> 59:56.780
Hollywood went under.

59:56.780 --> 01:00:02.180
I mean, I guess he does own Amazon prime 18 years ago, this would all happen.

01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:03.180
We've got to find those interviews.

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:04.180
You've been dead, right?

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:05.180
So I get what you're saying.

01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:06.180
Yeah.

01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:07.180
You got to find those interviews.

01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:08.180
Yeah.

01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:09.180
Yeah.

01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:10.180
Find those interviews.

01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:11.180
Find those interviews.

01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:12.180
I would like you to find those interviews.

01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:15.060
I love that self interview of like, are they going to hurt you?

01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:16.060
No.

01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:17.060
Are they dangerous?

01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:18.060
Maybe.

01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:19.060
But are they going to hurt you?

01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:20.060
No.

01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:21.060
Is Obama going to write another dumb book?

01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:22.060
You bet.

01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:23.060
Wow.

01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:25.620
What an infuriating way of talking to me.

01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:26.620
You asshole.

01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:27.620
Yeah.

01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:30.620
He put it out on Netflix, a dying entity.

01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:31.620
What?

01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:32.620
What?

01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:33.620
Netflix seems to be doing all right.

01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:34.620
Netflix is doing fine.

01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:35.620
We're not.

01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:36.620
I don't care.

01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:37.620
Why does that happen?

01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:38.620
Ugh.

01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:42.340
Do you think that that's an annoying way for someone to speak?

01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:43.340
Do I?

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:44.340
Yes.

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:45.340
Is it going to continue?

01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:46.340
Probably.

01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:47.340
Am I worried?

01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:48.340
No.

01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:55.140
I would say that you need to show some goddamn respect because this man single handedly.

01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:56.140
Don't tell me.

01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:57.140
He took down the Soviet Union.

01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:58.140
No.

01:00:58.140 --> 01:01:04.440
Years ago on your show, and maybe this was before I was on your show, 1980s, I was involved

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.660
in the takedown of the Soviet Union.

01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:10.980
Not me, just a group of us involved, both CIA, military.

01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:15.620
We took it down without any force or kinetic action.

01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:18.580
What happened is we made a little mistake.

01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:24.120
Instead of picking someone like Putin, we decided, and that was my fault, to have somebody

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:28.340
who was rational, open-minded, and we picked Gorbachev.

01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:30.660
Look, Gorbachev is on me, guys.

01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:37.900
I cannot believe how magnanimous he is being with admitting guilt for a thing he could

01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:41.160
not have been less involved in.

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:47.260
In the physical universe we inhabit, anything that he has ever done had zero effect.

01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:50.420
Me and my boys, we took down the Soviet Union, and then, look, we fucked up.

01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:51.420
Don't just say that to me.

01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:52.420
We fucked up.

01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:58.620
We put in Gorbachev and should have gone with a dictator right from the start.

01:01:58.620 --> 01:02:02.860
I do like that strategy of admitting fault for something that you absolutely did not

01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:03.860
do.

01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:07.860
It's disarming in a certain way.

01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:12.140
Try that at work the next time, whenever they're like, hey, you have been doing a tech... Listen,

01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:14.340
I'm really sorry.

01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:19.240
I thought it would be a good idea to overthrow the human resources department, and I installed

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:21.120
the current head, and that's on me.

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:24.260
That's on me right now, and they're like, what?

01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:26.140
Do you have a part of the hiring process?

01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:27.140
What's happening?

01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:33.260
Well, little do you know, I have been pulling the strings on all capitalist enterprises

01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:35.260
since the beginning of time.

01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:38.460
I invented investing.

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:44.180
Just swing... Hey, have you ever seen Undercover Boss and then take your beard off?

01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:47.180
I invented the chair.

01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:48.180
What?

01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:51.300
Oh, my God.

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:53.940
You know, before I came along, there wasn't photosynthesis.

01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:54.940
What?

01:02:54.940 --> 01:03:01.580
I just can't... Steve Pajetik, man, that dude.

01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:06.580
There's a disease there, but I don't know which, what, or how bad it is, but it's bad.

01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:11.180
What's so amazing about him is that I feel this way about Alex, too, is there will never

01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:12.180
be another.

01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:13.180
No, no.

01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:18.200
There won't be another Alex, because he came along at this perfect time in the era of public

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:25.660
access TV and right wing radio becoming ascendant, right when his career was taking an upward

01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:26.660
tick.

01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:32.660
Then he had this established career at the point when new media was really becoming a

01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:38.060
thing and social media, and so he had some credibility that other people lacked when

01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:42.220
information became so easily disseminated.

01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:45.320
Steve Pajetik is a guy who's nuts.

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:49.900
He is one of the most fun liars I think I've ever heard.

01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:50.900
Just spectacular.

01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:54.100
But he also did work at the State Department.

01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:55.100
Wild.

01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:58.780
He did, he was involved in Aldo Moro's death.

01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:02.000
These are things that are, they are just real.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.380
They did happen.

01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:08.380
All these other dicks who come around, people who are on Project Camelot, they're just making

01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:09.700
up everything.

01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:14.500
Steve's making up a lot, but he also has that veneer of credibility that comes from what

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:19.620
he was doing in the 70s, but I don't know if anyone will ever be able to replicate that.

01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:25.100
If you want to put together good credibility in this space, you need one tiny acorn of

01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:31.240
truth about you, and that will unlock your oak tree of bullshit, but you gotta have the

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:32.240
acorn.

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:36.940
You gotta have the acorn, and then if you want to be like Steve, you've gotta be naturally

01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:41.760
gifted at spinning these yarns and memorizing facts.

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:47.180
Or have a rare delusional disorder that allows you to think these things as though they were

01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:49.060
true and say them confidently.

01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:54.580
And then at the same time, Steve wouldn't be able to work without Alex.

01:04:54.580 --> 01:05:01.120
I've heard him on other shows, he was on Coast to Coast a couple times, it's not the same.

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:06.540
You need that Alex straight man that you can just steamroll.

01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:11.980
You need to be able to flatter someone into giving you so much fucking leash that essentially

01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:12.980
it's gone.

01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:13.980
Until it is gone.

01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:15.060
I own Amazon.

01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:17.140
And then you are on a leash.

01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:18.140
That's what happened.

01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:22.460
He was like, okay, we're gonna keep, look, Dr. Steve can go out of pocket, we're gonna

01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:25.500
keep him close, but we're gonna keep him on a leash.

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:30.100
And then all of a sudden, Alex is wearing that dog collar like, I don't know what happened.

01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:32.940
Yep, that is exactly what happened.

01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:40.860
So back to the narrative at hand, Steve took down the Soviet Union, accidentally put in

01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:41.860
Gorbachev.

01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:44.740
Or it was intentional then, but in hindsight, not a great decision.

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:49.220
I mean, I think ultimately he should still be proud of that decision.

01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:51.060
Putin wasn't ready yet, man.

01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:52.060
That's the real issue.

01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:53.060
That's probably true.

01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:57.460
If it weren't for Gorbachev, if you hadn't have revealed the corruption in the system,

01:05:57.460 --> 01:05:59.540
you never would have gotten Putin in the first place.

01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:01.620
See, it's playing out all over again.

01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:02.620
History rhymes, Dan.

01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:07.020
Well, interestingly, Steve is the kind of guy who likes to clean up his own messes.

01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:08.020
Wow, that's nice.

01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:12.140
So, you know, he put in Gorbachev, it wasn't a good idea, but he fixed that.

01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:13.140
Okay.

01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:17.340
Gorbachev was not strong enough to control 11 time zones.

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:20.680
So at that time, the Soviet Union was 14 time zones.

01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:28.020
So we picked, I reconstructed that mistake and I picked a man who worked for Andropov,

01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:31.180
the head of KGB named Vladimir Putin.

01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:33.260
Putin knows he was picked by me.

01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:37.460
He was specifically picked because he was East German intelligence.

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:38.520
He spoke English.

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:39.620
He spoke German.

01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:40.620
He spoke Russian.

01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:41.620
Yep.

01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:46.100
So apparently Steve handpicked Vladimir Putin to take over for Gorbachev to fix his mistake

01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:49.080
from after he overthrew the Soviet Union.

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:56.140
And Putin knows that Steve Puchenik was the one who was behind his rising to power.

01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:59.020
Oh boy.

01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:01.580
Outrageous.

01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:10.860
Hey, Alex, just so you know, Putin owes it all to me.

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:13.580
It's all me, Alex.

01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:16.260
Everything inside your entire career.

01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:17.260
That's me.

01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:23.140
And I can guide international relations by sending a message to China or India.

01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:25.540
Everybody just waits on my beck and call.

01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:30.140
Alex, listen, if you fuck with me, there's nowhere I can't find you.

01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:32.100
I can find you in the North.

01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:33.940
I can find you in the South.

01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:36.140
I can find you around the world.

01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:38.020
28 time zones.

01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:41.060
That's how many time zones I can find you in.

01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:42.340
Steve's never that animated.

01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:44.540
I know, but it'd be more fun.

01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:47.620
My character I think is a little bit of a nice addition.

01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:48.620
Yeah, I guess.

01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:54.900
I mean, I feel like Steve's, but Steve's menace is far more dry.

01:07:54.900 --> 01:08:01.340
You know, when there was the hurricane and he was scolding Alex about his manners, it

01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:03.500
was more terrifying that he didn't yell at him.

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:09.540
He was just like, wow, my neighbor's house is underwater right now and you're being a

01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:11.540
dick to me.

01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:12.540
That's scary.

01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:17.820
Yeah, yeah, he does have that cool level headed malevolence about him.

01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:18.820
That's a big feature.

01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:25.900
Yeah, so one of the clips that we found early on in our time doing the show was something

01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:32.140
that kind of shocked us, I believe, and it was the clip where Alex talks about going

01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:41.140
on RT and he gets debriefed by Russian intelligence and that was a bizarre clip and it's not something

01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:44.420
that we've heard a ton more from Alex about.

01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:48.660
We're going to have to find those Steve Pacenik clips from 18 years ago.

01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:55.360
So when Alex talked about that clip, or when he talked about that experience the first

01:08:55.360 --> 01:09:00.980
time we heard it, it was the story of the Russians being like, you know so much, you're

01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:03.600
brilliant, you know all this, it was all about Alex.

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:04.600
He's too brilliant.

01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:05.900
The story's a little different now.

01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:06.900
Oh is it?

01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:07.900
Alex tells it again.

01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:08.900
Oh.

01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:09.900
Kind of a different focus.

01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:10.900
Odd.

01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:14.180
The last time I was on Russian TV, this was probably about 10 years ago, 8, 9 years ago,

01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:18.780
they go, listen, we got this group wants to talk to you, it's this Russian national TV,

01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:20.660
we want you on.

01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:25.220
So I'm sitting there on Skype out of my office and it's this big boardroom and there's all

01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:29.740
these guys with beards, this is obviously not TV, and it's like all the big brain bugs

01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:34.200
their intelligence agents, they're all looking at me and they go, tell us about Pacenik.

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.820
How do you know Pacenik?

01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:37.060
What do you know about Pacenik?

01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:38.900
What do you think of Putin and Pacenik?

01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:43.760
And they were, I remember like, I'm not an intelligence operative, I'm a talk show host,

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:47.140
but definitely they had been sent by Putin to ask about you.

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:49.900
They kept like, and I just said, I don't know anything about Pacenik.

01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:53.960
He's an author, I've had him on, he used to work for U.S. intelligence agencies, but that's

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:58.860
a true story because it's a boardroom of like 15 dudes and like these are the Russians you

01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:03.100
see on TV, these are like the brain bugs, you know, like they're just like totally asking

01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:04.100
about you.

01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:05.100
Like from Starship Troopers.

01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:06.100
That actually happened.

01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:07.100
Yeah, that actually happened.

01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:08.100
That 100% actually happened.

01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:11.180
Yeah, so now the story is, they were thrilling him about Pacenik.

01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:14.580
Just because I've changed the story multiple times doesn't mean it didn't totally happen.

01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:20.940
Well, and it's certainly like what would happen if Pacenik is single-handedly responsible

01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:25.540
for USSR Russian history over the last decades.

01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:32.120
Yeah, yeah, it does seem like if he was the one who both overthrew the Soviet Union, installed

01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:39.380
multiple prime ministers, and so on and so forth, I don't even think that the RT guys,

01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:41.340
unless it was a splinter group.

01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:42.340
It would have to be.

01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:43.340
It would have to be.

01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:44.980
That's the only reason they would be asking about Steve, right?

01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:45.980
Right.

01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:47.900
It wouldn't be, because Steve would get the phone call if it was-

01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:48.900
From Putin.

01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:49.900
From Putin.

01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:50.900
He'd be like, hey.

01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:51.900
Yeah, exactly.

01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:52.900
It would be too easy.

01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:57.220
So now we've got a revolutionary group within the Soviet Union, or within the remnants of

01:10:57.220 --> 01:11:04.060
the Soviet Union, coming back to find out dirt on Steve so they can take him out because

01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:07.080
he's too powerful.

01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:08.220
Or it didn't happen.

01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:09.780
That would also be likely.

01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:10.780
Yeah.

01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:17.980
Or Alex got interviewed on Russian TV, and he was asked a question that sounded weird,

01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:21.220
and it became spycraft.

01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:26.900
Or he went on a show that did a pre-interview.

01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:28.500
You seem to talk to Steve Pacenik a lot.

01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:29.500
He's crazy, right?

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:32.980
With the writer's room.

01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:38.660
So Steve, his big thing is that Biden's going to be gone soon.

01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:42.700
Although the way he talks about it is a little bit off-putting.

01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:44.660
Biden will no longer be president.

01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:47.380
Blinken will not be Secretary of State.

01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:52.500
You will not have all these American Jewish guys who never served our country.

01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:55.120
25 of them remain in power.

01:11:55.120 --> 01:12:01.140
At the same time, Trump will have to have a whole new backup system, not with the people

01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:02.140
he had.

01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:03.700
Donald Trump has to go.

01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:04.700
Why?

01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:05.700
Trump has to go.

01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:07.900
Yeah, it seems real strange.

01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:09.700
I mean, not strange at all, but...

01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:11.660
No, that's vicious anti-Semitism.

01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:18.460
He seems very strongly focused on defining people by their religion or heritage.

01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:20.300
It's not good.

01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:26.140
There are very easy visual ways to disqualify people as humans in Steve Pacenik's world.

01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:27.140
Yeah.

01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:28.140
Yikes.

01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:29.140
Not good.

01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:30.140
Nope.

01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:36.220
It's like, Steve, our interview is about to come to an end, but I got to ask you.

01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:38.660
You saying that Biden's going to go down.

01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:39.660
Give me a timeframe.

01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:41.540
Oh, give me a timeframe, Steve.

01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:42.540
Make me another bet.

01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:43.540
I understand.

01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:47.420
So in closing, you're going to come back again soon, StevePacenik.com, found all your interesting

01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:48.600
work there.

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:52.880
In closing, though, what is the timeframe on Biden?

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:57.200
I will not give you a timeframe because the last timeframe was not accurate.

01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:04.060
So let us just say in time, with patience, you will see this evolution that we're talking

01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:05.060
about.

01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:06.740
Oh, listen, they know that evolution's there.

01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:08.380
That's why they're going to come after everybody.

01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:09.380
Okay.

01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:12.780
All right, Alex, convince yourself that this guy isn't fucking with you.

01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:15.800
So I admit I got the math wrong.

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:21.220
The end of the world is not on December 21st, 2021.

01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:24.280
It's going to be on December 21st.

01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:30.140
Doesn't sound anything like 2021, so it'll be there.

01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:35.580
This is so awesome and so frustrating and so funny.

01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:41.260
I can't imagine how little dignity one must have to allow Steve back on the show.

01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:42.260
It's sad.

01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:46.880
It's embarrassing to a level that I would have thought Alex would be above.

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:52.220
He has such an ego to him that I would have thought for sure he'd be like, Steve fucked

01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:53.220
me.

01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:56.260
Because around the election, that was unacceptable.

01:13:56.260 --> 01:14:00.500
There's no way, if I let him back on the show, it's going to look so bad.

01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:01.500
Yep.

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:02.500
Doesn't care.

01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:03.500
Steve's back.

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:06.460
Steve's back and Alex is making excuses for why maybe Steve's actually right.

01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:07.460
Yeah.

01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:08.860
I mean, I heard it in his voice.

01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:14.220
I heard that there was a certain despondence in his voice that I felt like was definitely

01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:15.220
there.

01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:16.220
Maybe.

01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:22.720
A little bit of disappointment, maybe a little bit of like, just a small smidge of what have

01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:23.720
I become?

01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:28.740
I feel, I felt a small, like when he was like, yeah, that's what they're talking about.

01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:30.780
I feel a small smidge of it.

01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:34.700
These are human emotions you're describing and I'm not sure they relate to this artificial

01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:36.320
world of bullshit.

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:37.460
You are so right.

01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:38.460
You're so right.

01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:39.660
I'm trying to be a human.

01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:44.120
I even think strategically from the world of bullshit, this is a bad decision.

01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:50.720
Like because all you're going to do is anybody who liked Alex and thought he was onto something

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:57.100
is going to look at him as somebody who is kowtowed to this guy who was wrong and definitively

01:14:57.100 --> 01:15:00.420
wrong and very angrily wrong.

01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:01.860
Made a bet about it.

01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:02.860
Yeah.

01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:03.860
Yeah.

01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:04.860
The Pope's been arrested.

01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:05.860
Yeah.

01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:06.860
What about the guy we see walking away?

01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:07.860
You don't see anybody walking away.

01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:08.860
Nah, come on.

01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:09.860
It's great.

01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:12.660
So that's just going to hurt Alex's image in the audience's eyes.

01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:13.660
Yeah.

01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:18.020
The best you're going to do is you're going to attract Steve's fans to you.

01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:19.020
They don't care.

01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:20.420
Steve sells supplements too.

01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:21.900
It's not like you're going to get his business.

01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:22.900
He's going to be fine.

01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:23.900
Yeah.

01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:24.900
Wow.

01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:25.900
Yeah.

01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:26.900
This is sad.

01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:32.540
And for somebody whose self image is so fucking macho to really go into this interview and

01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:38.920
just take a little kiss on the chin, a little pat on the head, and a I'll see you next time

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:39.920
is brutal.

01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:40.920
Yeah.

01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:41.920
That's brutal.

01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:48.000
Although flip side, I'm happy because I am too.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
I like seeing Alex humiliated.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000
That's enjoyable.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.800
And there's a Steve shaped hole on the show.

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:53.800
That's true.

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:54.800
Not anymore.

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:55.800
No.

01:15:55.800 --> 01:16:00.700
The guy is just like, he comes up with the baddest shit.

01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:01.700
Yeah.

01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:06.380
Now there's a fucking big head cut out of Steve directly behind Alex that you look up

01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:09.100
and every time you see Steve's face in his little tendrils.

01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:10.100
Yeah.

01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:11.100
His presence is back on the show.

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:12.100
Oh yeah.

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:13.100
We appreciate it.

01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:14.620
And hopefully this will reinvigorate things.

01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:21.820
It'll make me more interested in seeing where the fun thriller novel that Steve's writing

01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:22.820
goes.

01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:24.020
What's the next chapter?

01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:30.580
How do you escalate it from, I am the reason Putin owns Russia?

01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:31.580
I know.

01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:32.580
How?

01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:33.580
Space politics.

01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:34.580
Space politics.

01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:36.540
See, now we're getting an interesting territory.

01:16:36.540 --> 01:16:37.540
Oh yes.

01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:38.540
Yeah.

01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:39.860
Eventually he's going to have to escalate it to off world.

01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:41.220
Oh my God.

01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:43.340
Imagine disclosure happens, right?

01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:47.300
Even the government is like, yeah, we're, we've been in contact with aliens.

01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:48.900
Steve's going to have to up his game.

01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:49.900
Totally.

01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:50.900
He knows all these aliens.

01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:55.740
He's the one who negotiated the original treaties with the aliens.

01:16:55.740 --> 01:16:57.220
As soon as, Oh God.

01:16:57.220 --> 01:16:59.660
Why did Aldo Maro have to go down?

01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:00.660
Aliens.

01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:04.380
I would love it.

01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:07.100
I want disclosure to happen now just because of that.

01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:09.100
Yeah, it's gotta happen.

01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:10.100
Come on government.

01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:11.580
We need Steve's work here.

01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:12.580
Yeah.

01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:14.500
Yours is secondary.

01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:20.620
You're bullshit about hiding secrets secondary to what bullshit Steve's going to make up.

01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:21.620
Yeah.

01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:28.220
You are a roadblock in terms of our sort of interesting improvisational storytelling that

01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:30.340
we need Steve to engage in.

01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:31.340
Absolutely.

01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:32.340
Come on government.

01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:33.340
Yes, and us here.

01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:35.300
So that was the emergency report.

01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:41.060
I don't think watching it, I got convinced that there was an emergency or that January

01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:42.500
6th is a false flag.

01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:44.660
I was convinced of things I already knew.

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:47.300
One, Alex is a spineless worm.

01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:48.620
Yeah, agreed.

01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:53.220
Steve is an anti-semitic lunatic.

01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:56.300
Nick Fuentes is a racist asshole.

01:17:56.300 --> 01:18:02.180
And Alex has nothing else to do on Saturday except come in and maybe try and sell a few

01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:03.180
pills.

01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:06.020
Yeah, it does seem like maybe he didn't have the kids that weekend or something.

01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:07.020
Yeah.

01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:08.020
Gotta move a little product.

01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:09.020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:10.460
Anyway, we'll be back Jordan.

01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:12.020
But until then, we have a website.

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:13.020
We do have a website.

01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:14.020
It's knowledgefight.com.

01:18:14.020 --> 01:18:15.020
Yes.

01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:16.020
We are also on Twitter.

01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:17.020
We are on Twitter.

01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:18.020
It's at knowledgefight.net.

01:18:18.020 --> 01:18:19.020
Go to Ben Jordan.

01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:20.020
Also on Facebook.

01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:21.020
We are on Facebook.

01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:25.100
If you could, please find a local charity or bail fund in your area to help out people

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:26.100
doing God's work.

01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:27.100
Yeah, we'll be back.

01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:28.100
But until then, I'm Neo.

01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:29.100
I'm Leo.

01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:30.100
I'm DZX Clark.

01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:31.100
I'm Daryl Rundis.

01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:32.100
I installed...

01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:33.100
Damn it.

01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:38.780
I can't remember what the name of the king from Skyrim was.

01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:40.460
I put that guy in power.

01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:41.460
Okay.

01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:42.460
You're in Kansas.

01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:43.460
You're on the air.

01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:44.460
Thanks for holding.

01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:45.460
Hello, Alex.

01:18:45.460 --> 01:18:46.460
I'm a first time caller.

01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:47.460
I'm a huge fan.

01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:48.460
I love your work.

01:18:48.460 --> 01:19:17.460
I love you.
