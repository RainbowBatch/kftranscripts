00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,920
Damn and Jordan, I am sweating

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,040
knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,760
I have great respect for knowledge fight

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,720
knowledge fight

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,080
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,640
saying we are the bad guys

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,920
knowledge fight

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,080
Damn and Jordan, knowledge fight

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,240
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her

11
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,320
I need, I need money

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,200
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,080
Andy and Kansas, Andy and, Andy and

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,560
Stop it, Andy and, Andy and Kansas

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,960
Andy, Andy, it's time to pray

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,200
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,600
Hello Alex, I'm a victim, calling in my huge fan

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,800
I love your work

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,760

21
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,280
I love you

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,280
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan

23
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:01,920
I'm Jordan

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,080
We're a couple dudes, like to sit around to worship at the altar of Selene and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

25
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,520
Oh indeed we are, Dan

26
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,440
I was about to say Psalter of Selene

27
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,520
I heard it, I was gonna let it go

28
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,640
Not good

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,440
But you know, now that you've brought it up, I noticed

30
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,800
Yeah, how you doing?

31
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,560
Dan, I have a quick question for you

32
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,360
What is your bright spot for today?

33
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,520
My bright spot today, Jordan, very exciting announcement

34
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,160
Yes sir

35
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,640
So this is something I've been meaning to get to for a while, there have been technical difficulties

36
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,960
Which is code for my printer hasn't worked

37
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,840
Sure

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,320
I've been wanting to do this again, we did it like maybe a couple months back, six months back

39
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,720
Gave some buttons to folks, sent them out, and I wanted to do another run of these

40
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,400
We have some new designs themed around the cult of Selene

41
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,360
Excellent

42
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,760
And I would like to announce officially that we're gonna be doing another run of these buttons

43
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,920
for folks, and here's how it's gonna work

44
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,120
Because last time this completely screwed up all of my inboxes

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,600
And I am not interested in that

46
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,560
A little bit, yeah

47
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,800
So I've started a new email address that is specifically for this

48
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,720
You do not have to be someone who gives to the show, you do not have to be

49
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,120
anything, just anybody, if you would send your email, your address, I will

50
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,120
You do have to be capable of email

51
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,520
That is the one limitation on this

52
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,960
And you have to send me an address to send a button to

53
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,600
Well true

54
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,680
And then I will take care of everything else and you will have a button sent to you

55
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,880
The email address is kfbusiness at gmail.com

56
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,440
And that's spelled K-F-B-I-Z-N-E-S-S

57
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,400
KF business

58
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,880
Let's KF to business

59
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,840
At gmail.com

60
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:53,040
If you send an address to that, there's gonna be a little bit of time, you know, obviously

61
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,600
Sure

62
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,000
Gotta make these up so there could be a little bit of a delay

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But we will get this in the works, get some envelopes with your addresses on them

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,680
And get these buttons sent out to you

65
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,480
I'm very excited

66
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,480
I really, I know that last time we did this, one of the things that I discovered was

67
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,440
I was really, really enjoying the process of making buttons

68
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,280
You loved the meditation of buttons

69
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,720
Yes, there was a thing too, the crafting of it and the sort of, the repetitive

70
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,440
Sure, sure

71
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,840
Zen and the art of button making

72
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,280
Yeah, yeah, and I feel like we're in a safer place now too

73
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,080
There's a lot of precautions that we took the last time around

74
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,400
True

75
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,000
With wearing gloves while making the buttons and everything

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,880
And now it feels a little bit, you know, we can chill out a little bit and just send out a nice gift

77
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,920
Just send out some buttons

78
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,280
Yeah, so I'm very excited about that

79
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,480
And if you all want to send in some addresses, we'll get those buttons your way

80
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,960
Yeah, now admittedly this time his gloves will be on and they will be coated with anthrax

81
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,880
So it's a little bit of a different problem

82
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,760
I met an Elvis impersonator and he had some ideas

83
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,960
What about you Jordan, what's your bright spot?

84
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,120
My bright spot is, it's low, it's in the early stages

85
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,640
It's not a super bright spot

86
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:09,760
But after a year of writing nothing but mean things to Taylor Swift and stories about wizards

87
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,800
I've started a new project

88
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,520
That's great

89
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,480
It's much larger

90
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,400
Hopefully it'll be about the size of the book I put out last year

91
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,760
So that's spectacular

92
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,800
Yeah, and if it's any longer people will definitely not finish it

93
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,240
So I'm fine with that

94
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,000
Here's the inspiration

95
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,280
Yes, I'm very excited

96
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:27,920
Clink

97
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,120
Yes, absolutely

98
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,480
Well, I wish you the best with that

99
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,680
Yes, me too

100
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,520
So Jordan, today we have an episode to go over and it's a little bit of a challenge

101
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,680
It was a tough challenge for me

102
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,600
And here's what happened

103
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,000
Okay

104
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,720
So Jordan, Alex was out of studio at the beginning of this week

105
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,040
He was in New York

106
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,540
Sure

107
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,040
I mean, I think you're

108
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,560
Is he allowed in New York?

109
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,960
Maybe, yeah

110
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,680
Doesn't Letitia have people on the border?

111
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,480
Well, see, I think that a lot of people probably, that's the first thing their mind would go to

112
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,360
Is that he's probably going to deal with some sort of a legal issue with

113
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,320
the attorney general of New York, Letitia James

114
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,520
Who he has threatened on air multiple times

115
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,760
And of course, he had the cease and desist for some of the products that he was selling

116
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,400
And I think that there is a possibility that that's the case

117
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,880
You know, like, you suspiciously went to Connecticut

118
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,480
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah

119
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,400
Recently, it's like, oh, why'd you go there?

120
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah

121
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,720
Maybe something to do with one of your court cases

122
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,680
It's possible, but also he was going there to do a podcast

123
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,240
He went on that Flagrant 2 podcast

124
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,360
Oh, yeah, when he was drunk last time

125
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,720
He said all the weird stuff

126
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,960
Well, yeah, he was so drunk last time that I don't even care to cover it

127
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah

128
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,160
And so, like, he went there

129
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,880
You could think that maybe he's going there for some legal issue

130
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,800
But then also maybe he's just doing this podcast

131
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,600
Yeah, sure

132
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
And so that was a possibility

133
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,040
Maybe we cover that episode

134
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,680
Sure

135
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,880
Simultaneously, Kill Tony, the podcast, had Alex as a guest

136
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,840
Ugh

137
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,760
Tony Hinchcliffe, noted Asian slur purveyor

138
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,480
Yeah, hasn't anybody taken that towards his career?

139
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,200
Yes, actually

140
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,000
Let's kill Tony's career

141
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,720
Can we do that?

142
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,200
Well, I mean

143
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,160
That's my new podcast

144
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,520
He did get dropped by his agent

145
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,200
Well, that's good, we're on our way

146
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,040
So we've at least maimed Tony's career

147
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,640
Yeah, I mean, I don't think it'll matter

148
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:37,280
Because the cult of Rogan Enterprises has him ensconced under their umbrella

149
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,120
But yeah, so Tony Hinchcliffe is a writer, guy, and comedian

150
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,920
Who he formerly wrote for the WWE and such

151
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,920
And he's one of Rogan's buddies

152
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,040
And he's one of the ones who decided to go to Austin

153
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,400
Because their bread is buttered in a very specific place

154
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,200
Yeah, yeah, there's no reason to be in LA anymore

155
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,400
People don't like me there

156
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:58,900
No!

157
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,180
Bye!

158
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,080
Texas is where I'm welcome

159
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,160
My career revolves around Joe Rogan

160
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,840
Joe Rogan's going to Texas

161
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,280
I am too

162
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,720
That's so sad

163
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,280
No, it's not

164
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,040
I think it's people understanding where their cottage industry is

165
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,000
Oh no, totally

166
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,920
I'm talking about the specifics of my career revolves around Joe Rogan

167
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,720
He can do worse

168
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,920
Yeah, that's true

169
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,280
So Kill Tony is a podcast that he does

170
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,000
That grew out of this open mic at the Comedy Store

171
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,160
I believe it was called Potluck Night or something

172
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,280
Something like that, yeah

173
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,240
And so like they just

174
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,520
I guess they just decided like let's find a way to monetize this

175
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,360
And so they monetized an open mic

176
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,080
Not terrible

177
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,580
Yeah

178
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,520
Of the business decisions for an open mic

179
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,440
That one's probably the best I've ever heard

180
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,160
Sure

181
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,800
I've listened to a number of episodes of it

182
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,600
Because there was a morbid curiosity on my part

183
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,920
And like back, you know, a ways back

184
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,200
Not just just recently

185
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,960
But you know the show is basically you've got Tony

186
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,600
You got his producer Brian Redban

187
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,200
And then you got a guest

188
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,360
A celebrity comedian guest

189
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,520
And they just act like hot shit while

190
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,400
Yeah, they just talk shit

191
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,120
A comic does a minute of material

192
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,920
Which is impossible to tell

193
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,600
No, no, no, that's all you need

194
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,720
That's all you need

195
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,840
That's all you need to know if you've got it

196
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,840
Yeah, and then the guests and the hosts will fuck around and act cool

197
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,720
And generally be overly encouraging of some things

198
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,640
And overly mean to anybody who doesn't fit into their like their box

199
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,200
Yeah

200
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,400
And it's just dumb

201
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,680
And I wanted to cover it kind of

202
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,960
Because I felt like, all right, this could be fun

203
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,360
This could be a fun thing to do an episode about

204
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:49,200
But so much of the episode is like about other people's stand-up sets

205
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,760
Sure

206
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,200
And open mic stand-up sets

207
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,320
And I don't want to cover that

208
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,600
And Alex was the guest

209
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,800
He wasn't due in a minute

210
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,000
Yes

211
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,240
He was the guest judge

212
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,640
Okay

213
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,920
And so like I guess I have this drop

214
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,080
How about some of that Joe Rogan weed?

215
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,880
So there's that

216
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,240
Okay, all right

217
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,680
I guess I have this drop

218
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,320
Once a year?

219
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,960
Yeah, I have this drop

220
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,520
You have a beautiful vagina

221
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,800
Have a nice night

222
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,400
I guess we got that out of it

223
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:16,960
Great

224
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,520
There's a part where Alex smells some girl's feet who's in the audience

225
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:21,840
Cool

226
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,000
They call her up on stage because one of the open micers has a foot fetish

227
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,400
And then they get somebody with a foot to smell

228
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,480
And I don't know

229
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:30,880
Great

230
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,920
Yeah, that's not an episode

231
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,960
Great, great

232
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,840
I'm loving every part of this right up my alley

233
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,560
I'm sure Alex had some insightful criticisms for the comedians

234
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,960
There's one guy who had some dumb jokes

235
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,880
And Alex is like, I'm drunk but that was a very cerebral set

236
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,320
Okay

237
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,840
I enjoyed that

238
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,760
There is some insightful criticisms there

239
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,240
Yeah

240
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,840
I think actually surprisingly at least at the beginning

241
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,000
He was a little bit more thoughtful than Tony

242
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,960
Yeah, well

243
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,160
Or Red Band

244
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,040
Yeah, well, familiarity breeds contempt if you will

245
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:15,280
It's very difficult for me because, you know, critiquing some of this stuff within the comedy space

246
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,400
Is always going to be walking in molasses

247
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,040
Sure

248
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,920
There's not like

249
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,040
People will just hide behind the like, it's comedy, I'm just joking

250
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,680
Right, right

251
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,560
Whatever stuff

252
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,720
And I don't know, I was listening to the Kill Tony

253
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,160
And I thought like, I have a lot of complaints about this

254
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,440
But who cares

255
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:43,360
Yeah, I kind of feel like maybe listening and criticizing a podcast

256
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,480
That's about listening and criticizing comedians

257
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,560
Open mic comedians

258
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,720
Is just a waste of everyone's time

259
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,720
Yeah, it felt like challenging, nay, impossible

260
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,080
To make worth listening to

261
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah

262
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,400
And so I was like, well, maybe we'll do a little bit about that episode of Flagrant 2

263
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:06,720
Sure

264
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,600
You know, why not?

265
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,480
This is a little bit longer, this is a conversational piece

266
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,320
Yeah, I want to know what their feet smell like

267
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,240
Alex was so drunk on the first time that I just didn't want to cover it

268
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,480
This time he's a little bit better, but I couldn't handle listening to it

269
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,000
It's so annoying

270
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,520
And look, I think that the hosts actually make a couple of pretty decent jokes

271
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,160
Oh, okay

272
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,960
Like, I can see a little bit of why, if that's what you like, that's fine

273
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,360
Okay

274
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,280
If you like broey, edgy comedy

275
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:37,600
Sure

276
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,240
Or whatever

277
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,880
Sure, sure, sure

278
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,480
Chat where people are talking about, hey, I had a threesome last week or whatever

279
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,520
Ooh, what a

280
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,920
If you enjoy that, then I can see, you know, this being up your alley

281
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,240
Sure

282
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,160
It was insufferable for my purposes

283
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,560
Hmm

284
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,920
Alex takes his shirt off at one point early

285
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,480
Oh boy

286
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:56,960
Early

287
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,000
Early

288
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,960
And one of the hosts

289
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,160
What is he, did he see Burt Kreischer on Kill Tony?

290
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,720
Get this

291
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,120
What?

292
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,200
One of the hosts calls him Burt Kreischer

293
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,320
Okay, well there we go

294
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,200
And then the other host makes the joke, did you say Burt crisis actor?

295
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,120
Which is not bad

296
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,080
Boo

297
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,200
See, it's not bad wordplay, it's not bad wordplay

298
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,800
I understand the wordplay

299
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,000
I understand the wordplay

300
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,840
But see, it's funny because Alex ruined a bunch of people's lives

301
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,200
See, these guys are just jokes, they're making jokes to Alex

302
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,560
Right, right, right, right

303
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,560
Not critiquing him about how he ruined a bunch of people's lives by calling them crisis actors

304
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,520
No, it's hilarious

305
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,480
Yeah, it's funny

306
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,760
No, whenever you leave a wake of misery and destruction, what you should do with that is like

307
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,080
make it a funny little bit that you can pun off of

308
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,720
Yeah, it's hilarious

309
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,000
Yeah, everybody will be like, holy shit, I can't believe he pulled it off

310
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,400
Yeah

311
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:48,640
Yeah

312
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,840
So I mean like, look, it's obviously only funny because

313
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,360
you're talking about something monstrous that the person next to you did

314
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,720
Right, right, right, right

315
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,640
But that said, fine wordplay

316
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,920
Anyway, I really struggle

317
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,280
More like Iraq bored George W. Bush

318
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,960
All right, let's all have a fun time

319
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,200
See, that's a fun joke to make in a friendly conversation with George W. Bush

320
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
Yes, exactly, very funny

321
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,760
Yeah, oh man, that genocide

322
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,880
You are, whoo, let me see, your pictures are dumb, hahaha, all right

323
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,640
So we have a couple things that I'm going to talk about towards the end of the episode

324
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:29,920
from the Flagrant podcast because I think there were even, you know, like as much as it's just

325
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,480
like, ah, these guys are just bullshitting and having fun and whatever, I don't care

326
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,320
I don't care

327
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:36,560
Yeah

328
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:42,400
But there are a couple of salient points that I think could be brought up and, you know,

329
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,080
whatever, we'll talk about that at the end of the episode

330
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,720
Gotcha

331
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:51,120
Thankfully, something happened that's breaking news and Alex had to weigh in on it

332
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,880
And so that's what we'll be talking about today

333
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,960
A special report that Alex put out last night as we're recording this

334
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,720
Wednesday evening

335
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,120
All right

336
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So this is a last minute

337
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Is it an emergency report on something that was reported roughly a year ago

338
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,520
that we're finally talking about now?

339
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,200
No, no, no, this is actually breaking news

340
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,320
You know what we're going to talk about

341
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,760
Well, yeah, obviously

342
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,440
Anyway, we're going to get to this, but before we do, let's say hello to some new wonks

343
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,320
Oh, that's a good idea

344
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,480
So first, Chavez, why Chavez? Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

345
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,520
I'm a policy wonk

346
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,120
Thank you, Chavez, why?

347
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,120
Thank you, next, Alex in Blunderland, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

348
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,240
I'm a policy wonk

349
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,240
Thank you, Alex in Blunderland

350
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,320
Next, Chris, and then there's an alias here

351
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,080
Jordan's Laughter is Sweet Sweet Music, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

352
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,600
I'm a policy wonk

353
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,320
Thanks, Chris

354
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,440
Next, Dimer, this is Paul, give Dan some money

355
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,440
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

356
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,960
I'm a policy wonk

357
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,080
I don't endorse that message

358
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,000
Okay, Dimer, this is Paul

359
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,440
Okay

360
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,920
And then, look, Technocrat, shout out going out to...

361
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,400
I don't know how to say this, maybe Dicobros?

362
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,120
D-I-E-C-O-B-R-O-S

363
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,880
Okay, Andrew Dice Bros

364
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,600
Ooh, yeah

365
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,880
You're now a technocrat

366
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,160
I'm a policy wonk

367
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,200
Crikey, mate, that's fantastic, have yourself a brew

368
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,640
How's your 401k doing, bro?

369
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,440
All right, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

370
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,720
Let's just get down to business

371
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,800
We ain't making that money off that heroin

372
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,160
Why are you pimps so good?

373
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,480
My neck is freakishly large

374
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,040
I declare info war on you

375
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,080
Thank you so much

376
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,840
Yes, thank you very much

377
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,720
Now, Jordan

378
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,440
Yes, sir

379
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,960
We have to get contemplative

380
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,360
Okay

381
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,840
Giving someone life is giving someone death

382
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,280
You could say that...

383
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,680
Life is death

384
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,040
You could

385
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,000
So first, Fiona got a birthday this week

386
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,200
So happy birthday, Fiona

387
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,400
Happy birthday, Fiona

388
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,240
Laura and Lisa reached out and wanted to wish Ron a happy birthday

389
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,360
So happy birthday, Ronnie

390
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,640
Happy birthday, Ron

391
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:50,880
Yeah

392
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,080
Cooper got a birthday coming up

393
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,360
Jillian says happy birthday

394
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,400
Happy birthday, Coops

395
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,800
Also would like to wish a happy 21st anniversary to Heather and Phillip

396
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,720
Also known as Captain Awesome

397
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,840
Okay, together they're known as Captain Awesome?

398
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,920
Probably Mizra and Miz Awesome

399
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,360
Okay, all right, well that's good

400
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,040
Also, I checked into this

401
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,440
You know, the Hallmark recommends yearly anniversary gift

402
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,000
Sure, sure

403
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,440
They got the paper anniversary

404
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,400
That's first anniversary

405
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,280
Right, right, right

406
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,800
What do you think the 21st is?

407
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,200
Because I checked into this just to be sure

408
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,680
Is it like brass or something?

409
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,200
Is it one of those?

410
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,920
It's brass, but it's specifically like a tuba

411
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,360
It's like that kind of brass

412
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,960
Hallmark recommends a 21st tuba anniversary

413
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,360
Gotcha

414
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,120
34th anniversary is woodwind

415
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,360
Yes, of course, naturally, yes

416
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,360
No, it's a themed gift surrounding the idea of fire

417
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,800
So that's an interesting

418
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,400
All right, so let's go with

419
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,320
I mean, I have a tattoo of a fire bender's symbol

420
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,440
So we've got that

421
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,840
You can get yourself some fire bending tattoos

422
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,160
Sure

423
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,280
I think that's a great idea

424
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,320
Talk to Zuko, get that out

425
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,200
You know what I'm saying?

426
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:05,600
Sure

427
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,360
Yeah, fire-based gifts

428
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,640
Light your house on fire

429
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,560
Yep, and finally

430
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,360
Black Dragon Queen Christy

431
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,320
Oh!

432
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,160
Our old friend Christy

433
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,000
Happy birthday coming up

434
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,720
Happy birthday

435
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,440
This weekend

436
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,240
And also end of last month

437
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,320
End of May

438
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,120
Christy and her husband Monty celebrated their 30th anniversary

439
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,080
No shit!

440
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,720
What?

441
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,920
What in God's name?

442
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,080
Do you get like a pair of timpani for that?

443
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,160
What kind of, are we just doing orchestral anniversaries at this point?

444
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,440
30th anniversary is office or desk decor

445
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,120
That's a lie

446
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,520
That's actually the 41st anniversary

447
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,640
The 41st

448
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,320
So you're telling me that I'm somewhere at, I mean, conservatively in my 70s

449
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:52,880
Uh huh

450
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,680
And you're getting me some office equipment?

451
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,920
So even in Hallmark's world, you work till death

452
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,160
Absolutely

453
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,080
There is no retirement, no social security

454
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,240
No

455
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,840
Office equipment

456
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,800
Yes, office equipment on your 41st anniversary

457
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,360
30th is apparently pearls from what this is saying

458
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,960
I would rather have that one, end your marriage at 30

459
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,800
Why would you make it all the way to 41?

460
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,520
You don't need office equipment, 30 years is long enough

461
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,280
You're gonna love 39th anniversary

462
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,240
What's that one?

463
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:24,720
Laughter

464
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,800
Laughter

465
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,760
Well Dan, every day I celebrate my 39th anniversary

466
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,000
Yeah

467
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,160
Weird, this list is weird

468
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,680
That is a weird list

469
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,280
53rd anniversary

470
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,880
That is, that is the list

471
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,080
53rd, what do you think it is?

472
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,320
You've made it a long time, you're 53 years into a marriage

473
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:44,800
I feel like

474
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,720
Keep in mind, 40th anniversary is ruby, right?

475
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,600
So, okay

476
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,640
So 53, what is it?

477
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,680
So the decades are precious items

478
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,800
Yes, 50th is gold

479
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,200
And then the intervening years is, is, I guess at random

480
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,480
Nick Maxx

481
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,480
It's a bunch of shit pulled out of a hat

482
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:02,960
Yeah

483
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,920
I suppose

484
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,680
So what's 53?

485
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,680
50th is gold

486
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,040
60th is diamond

487
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,160
60th is diamond

488
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,560
40th is ruby, what's 53?

489
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,000
53, I gotta go with marine creature

490
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,880
Plastic

491
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,960
Plastic, plastic

492
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,240
Laughter

493
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,840
So you're telling me that I'm at 90 years old and I'm getting saran wrapped for my anniversary?

494
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,480
If you're lucky

495
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,040
All right

496
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,840
If someone's following the Hallmark recommendations

497
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,560
Thanks Hallmark

498
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,160
Anyway, happy anniversary, Christine

499
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,880
Happy birthday

500
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,040
Also, Alex would like to remind everyone that we were born dead

501
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,600
Yes

502
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,360
Life is death

503
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,000
Or something

504
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,040
Or something

505
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:49,600
So, Jordan, as you know, the big news that was breaking yesterday is that John McAfee is no more

506
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,400
Yes

507
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:50,720
Or

508
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,480
Is he

509
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,880
He was found deceased in a prison cell in Spain

510
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,440
Sure

511
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,480
He had just gotten word that he would be extradited to the United States

512
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,880
to face some criminal charges

513
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,440
Yeah, I think if I were being extradited from Spanish prison to United States prison,

514
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,280
I'd be like, nah, I'm out

515
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,280
It's, it's hard to say, but it's not if you're Alex

516
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,880
Hmm, John McAfee did not kill himself in public statements and on his own Twitter

517
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,520
As early as just last week, he said, I will never commit suicide if I die in prison

518
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,240
I have been murdered by the US government

519
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,560
I'm going to listen to a man I'm new and respected

520
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,680
Not the lying corporate media that before his body's even cold

521
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,960
You respected?

522
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,920
It's a suicide with no coroner or no inquest

523
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,800
This thing sneaks to high heaven just like Jeffrey Epstein

524
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:46,640
That's a good, that's a good cold open to his special report that he put out

525
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,400
That's not bad, that's pretty direct

526
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,360
So even if we take as absolute gospel fact that McAfee said he would never kill himself,

527
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,280
he was the definition of an unhinged,

528
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,120
drugged out lunatic who said complete bullshit, essentially for a living

529
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,280
I would never imagine that a man so respected as John McAfee

530
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,280
would perhaps send out a dumb idea very quickly before he thought it through

531
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,120
A couple of my favorite things that he said that were complete nonsense were,

532
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,120
you know, like when he said that he had nothing to do with his neighbor in Belize's murder

533
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,440
No

534
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,480
Or that time that he said that if Bitcoin wasn't trading at $500,000 within three years

535
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:26,000
from July 17th, 2017, he would quote, eat his own dick on national television

536
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,960
Did he ever do that?

537
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,520
He didn't

538
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,400
Oh, I guess it's too late now

539
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,320
Some of his more recent work includes that time that he tried to create a publicity stunt hoax

540
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,600
where he pretended to have been arrested for refusing to wear a mask,

541
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,080
wearing a lace thong on his face instead

542
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,040
Ah, he's brilliant

543
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,000
McAfee and his wife publicly claimed he'd been arrested in Norway,

544
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,840
but the pictures that they posted as evidence of this were from the Augsburg airport,

545
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,280
which is in Germany

546
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,280
The Augsburg police told the media, quote,

547
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,040
there has never been an arrest, explaining that McAfee tried to enter Germany,

548
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,000
but decided not to when he was told that he would have to quarantine

549
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,240
Then he just created a bunch of bullshit on social media

550
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:00,960
Right, right, right

551
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,840
And who could forget the ridiculous runs for the libertarian nomination for the presidential race

552
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,200
or the very overt and transparent history of involvement in pump and dump cryptocurrency scams

553
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,840
Sure

554
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,600
In fact, that was one of the cases that McAfee was facing, along with tax evasion,

555
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,800
which is what the US was looking to extradite him back from Spain in order to prosecute him for

556
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,720
Soon before he was found dead,

557
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,680
a court ruled that he could be extradited to the United States, and this actually really matters

558
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,000
McAfee was 75 years old, and he was facing essentially the rest of his life in prison

559
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,640
for his fraud and tax crimes, which he absolutely would be convicted for

560
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,120
Yeah

561
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,720
Since there's video that he released of himself where he confesses,

562
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,480
which might be tough to refute

563
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,040
Let's hear it

564
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,080
I have not paid taxes for eight years, I've made no secret of it

565
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,840
I have not filed returns

566
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,400
Every year I tell the IRS I'm not filing a return, I have no intention of doing so

567
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,600
Come and find me

568
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,960
Yeah, that's gonna be tough

569
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,360
You know what bums me out?

570
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:03,840
What bums me out so much is that we know for a fact that if you are rich,

571
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,880
you literally can get away with not paying taxes

572
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,040
You know what I'm saying?

573
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,080
Like, we just got a New York Times report

574
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,640
Sure

575
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,600
About how you don't have to pay taxes if you're rich

576
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,680
And the only way that you can fuck up if you're rich is if you're just an asshole like this

577
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,880
It's the only way!

578
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,640
There's one way!

579
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,160
It's... some people are too defiant, I guess

580
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,520
I'll never pay taxes

581
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,760
Well then use any one of a million loopholes we've created for rich people to not have to do that

582
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,520
It's about the principle of the thing

583
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,920
Then fine, you're gonna die in a Spanish prison

584
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,960
I don't know what to tell you!

585
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,200
This is on you!

586
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,480
It's basically like the ceiling, metaphorically which is taxes, is coming down

587
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,960
Yes

588
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,600
And there's an open door

589
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,560
Yes

590
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,840
And it's like, do you want to go through that door?

591
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,480
It's open

592
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,120
It's open

593
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,320
There's nothing on the other side

594
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:58,720
Yes

595
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,680
There's no punishments

596
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,480
It's not a trap

597
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,000
You'll just go off your business

598
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,920
This is a loophole for the whole roof thing

599
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,800
The whole thing

600
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,440
I will not

601
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,160
I will be crushed by this roof

602
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,640
Okay

603
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,200
All right, man

604
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,080
I can't say with certainty that McAfee died from suicide

605
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,280
But if that does end up being the determination that experts end up making, I'm not going to be surprised

606
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,920
I wanted to get a sense of how the media was covering this death

607
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:24,480
So I sampled some of the largest outlets that were covering the story

608
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:24,960
Mm-hmm

609
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,480
The headline in CNN was

610
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,920
quote, John McAfee found dead in Spanish prison after his extradition to the United States was approved

611
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,280
The article doesn't say that there's a known cause of death at all

612
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:40,480
quote, McAfee was found dead in his cell in a prison near Barcelona on Wednesday around 1 p.m.

613
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,960
Eastern and a medical examiner is on the scene

614
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,960
A spokeswoman for the Superior Court of Catalonia told CNN

615
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,520
She said the cause of death is under investigation

616
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,800
A statement from the Catalonia Regional Government Justice Department

617
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,400
which manages prisons there

618
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,080
said that prison medical personnel and guards attempted to perform life-saving procedures

619
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,040
after finding McAfee but were unsuccessful

620
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,760
The statement said

621
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,720
quote, everything indicates unquote that McAfee could have died by suicide

622
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,880
That article is eminently responsible and doesn't jump to any conclusions

623
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,160
Wildly so

624
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,520
The BBC headline was

625
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,600
quote, John McAfee anti-virus creator found dead in prison cell

626
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,000
The article also doesn't provide a cause of death but does mention that same press release

627
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,760
quote, the Catalan Justice Department said prison medics tried to resuscitate him but were not successful

628
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,040
It's said in a statement that

629
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,160
quote, everything indicates unquote McAfee took his own life

630
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,800
Right

631
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,480
The New York Times story has a headline

632
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,520
quote, John McAfee software pioneer turned fugitive dies in Spanish prison

633
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,520
They mentioned the primary source statement

634
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,160
quote, the Justice Department for the Catalan region in Spain said that pending an investigation

635
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,720
it was treating his death as a probable suicide

636
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,280
The NPR story doesn't even talk about the Catalonia Justice Department comment

637
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,480
instead just reporting

638
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,200
quote, authorities are investigating the cause of death

639
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,800
This article even goes out of its way to soften McAfee's image

640
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,760
and turn him into some kind of a prankster type outlaw

641
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,640
quote, McAfee took pride in outwitting authorities

642
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,640
He once boasted about eluding police by dressing as a German tourist in a speedo

643
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,560
and another time as an angry homeless man

644
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:16,480
It's like the NPR version of this is really like

645
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,760
I mean these things are true

646
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,720
McAfee did do

647
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,680
Sure, sure

648
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,960
He did enjoy creating this outlaw

649
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,680
Right, right

650
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,520
On the run image of himself

651
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:25,840
Yeah

652
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,200
Outsmarting the police

653
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,920
Right

654
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,600
And you know, it's not wrong for NPR to report that

655
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,480
but that seems to be the angle that they're taking more

656
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,280
Yeah, I would have included more of his bombastic psychotic criminal acts

657
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:45,440
but I suppose if you want to paint him as a modern day world traveling

658
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,800
catch me if you can type con artist

659
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,120
Yeah

660
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:49,600
Fine

661
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,240
Yeah

662
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,760
Reuters had this headline

663
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:57,440
quote, larger than life software mogul John McAfee dies in Spain by suicide, lawyer says

664
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,720
This is because this story isn't about the actual death

665
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,120
It's about McAfee's lawyer making a statement that McAfee died by suicide

666
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:11,520
quote, McAfee's lawyer Javier Villalba said the anti-virus software pioneer died by hanging

667
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,000
as his nine months in prison brought him to despair

668
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,200
Even so, even though this article is saying this

669
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,880
the article does not say that this in fact was the cause of death

670
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,600
only that McAfee's lawyer had said that it was

671
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,480
None of these outlets are reporting anything definitive

672
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,640
and the information that they have to go on is directly from primary source statements

673
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,880
one from the Catalonia Justice Department and one from McAfee's own lawyer

674
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,040
This is responsible reporting of the facts

675
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:41,920
I can't find examples of these folks rushing and jumping the gun to call this a suicide

676
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:49,040
No, I can hear every editor of every major outlet screaming we're not doing an Epstein this time

677
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:53,120
All right, no fuck-ups, no Epstein conspiracy theories

678
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,440
But here's why this looking at the coverage is important

679
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,320
Alex is trying to rush and jump the gun on the conclusion that his death was not a suicide

680
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,080
and in order to do that he needs to make the circumstances around the coverage

681
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,720
seem as suspicious as possible Alex is reporting a fiction

682
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,440
which is that the media is immediately and without cause declaring McAfee's death a suicide

683
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,680
because they're trying to cover something up

684
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:22,320
because that kernel of suspicion is necessary for Alex to use this story for his own purposes

685
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:28,480
Alex is an opportunist by nature and he needs to use everything he can for his largest benefit

686
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,200
Just last week Alex was covering that reporter Christopher Sein's death as a definitive

687
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,080
professional execution and his big prediction was

688
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,280
the globalists are going to start killing people like himself and Tucker

689
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,840
This situation with McAfee isn't a perfect fit

690
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,880
but it's good enough for Alex to use to claim that he was right

691
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,120
so this absolutely cannot be a suicide in Infowars world

692
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,240
Yeah, it's almost like it really doesn't matter how responsible the reporting of mainstream outlets is

693
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,960
Alex is just going to make it up on his own regardless

694
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,080
Yeah, absolutely

695
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,560
There's a real danger to this kind of behavior and it's in how Alex's rhetoric has been shaped

696
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:06,240
over the course of the past year and even further back honestly

697
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,520
The COVID pandemic has been declared the globalists big move and something that they can't undo

698
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,920
This is the end game coming into reality which means that there's no going back

699
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,520
Alex has said that over and over in so many different constructions

700
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,960
Victory or death, no going back, they've crossed the Rubicon

701
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,440
over and over and over again in different ways saying there's no going home again

702
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:33,600
Also, I'm very very sorry Hamdi, it's on me, I apologize, I know I said I would die on that hill

703
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,280
but listen, my bad

704
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:40,160
The rhetoric surrounding how this is like the end game and you know this is the big move

705
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,400
That's dangerous enough on its own

706
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:47,040
and if Alex is now going to start reporting stuff like people like McAfee dying as the

707
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,840
globalists killing off brave patriot leaders

708
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,360
What's the logical leap he's expecting his audience to make?

709
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,360
He constantly talks about how everyone needs to keep lists of globalists in their town

710
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,000
and be ready to take them out when things jump off

711
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,160
How is killing off patriot leaders

712
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,240
not the most explicit evidence that things have jumped off that you could imagine?

713
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:06,880
Yeah

714
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,600
Whether he means to do this or not is kind of irrelevant

715
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,880
It's just part of the message that his audience is going to take from that

716
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,280
As far as I can tell all we can really do is hope that the people who get that message

717
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,080
aren't the type of listeners that he has who like to take action

718
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,400
Yeah because the only message you can get is

719
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,760
once they're done with all of these people they're coming for you

720
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,240
Right

721
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,080
So you might as well stop them now before they come for you

722
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:36,400
Yeah and talking about like Epstein as a murder, a Hillary murder or whatever

723
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,960
is a little bit different even because that's like

724
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,040
all right they're trying to cover up their tracks

725
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,360
Right

726
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,080
Or whatever

727
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,480
It's not a direct assault on the patriot folks

728
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:46,960
True

729
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,640
These people that Alex respects

730
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,200
Epstein wasn't a patriot that's for sure

731
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,640
He's not like McAfee a libertarian anti-tax weirdo

732
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,520
Right right right

733
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,520
Who actually would go on Infowars

734
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,320
He really would

735
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,120
Is this really gonna move the needle though?

736
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,920
I feel like McAfee is just gonna be a blip and then everybody's gonna be like yeah I'm fine

737
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,200
Alex needed it to justify the previous coverage of his

738
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,200
predictions of patriot leaders being killed

739
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,200
So it's very important for that piece

740
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,800
True he's got to sell it hard

741
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,240
But second I don't think that at this point Alex is aware that

742
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,000
McAfee's Instagram posted a big Q right after he died

743
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,280
Which is gonna complicate

744
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,880
That's gonna make it a little weird

745
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,960
That's gonna make it a little bit dicey

746
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:34,400
Yeah so Alex talks a little bit about how he got to know McAfee

747
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,640
I got a chance to get to know McAfee back in 2012 right after his escape

748
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:46,640
from Belize into Guatemala and found to be a larger than life type character

749
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,800
Then a few years later he came and visited us several times in Austin Texas

750
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,480
I had a chance to go to dinner with him

751
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,320
Had a chance to go out shooting with him

752
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,880
And he was even more larger than life in person

753
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,320
The guy was definitely an American success story

754
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,680
He made billions of dollars with his McAfee anti-virus software

755
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,240
So in terms of being an American success story

756
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,240
McAfee was born in England

757
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,640
And he once told the BBC quote I feel as much British as I do American

758
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,360
Well

759
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,200
He founded McAfee Associates but he also sold that in 1994

760
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,800
And since then it's not what I would call a glowing success story

761
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,440
You know more like a cautionary tale

762
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,480
Or just perhaps an evil motherfucker wandering around

763
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,760
Upsetting weirdo

764
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,280
Yeah that's a good way of putting it

765
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,320
I'll take that one

766
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,080
Um so Alex has a comparison

767
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,400
A historical comparison that he makes

768
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,960
That what a shock it has to do with booze

769
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,480
Larger than life

770
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,400
I would compare the guy to like Captain Morgan

771
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,080
He's seen on the side of the rum bottles

772
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,080
I think the pirate

773
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,200
And he certainly tried to go retire down in Belize and live like a pirate

774
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,080
Hmm

775
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,720
Captain Henry Morgan was a big old pile of shit

776
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,720
I don't know if this is the person you'd want to be compared to

777
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,840
In his later career he was employed by Jamaica

778
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,840
To keep privateers and pirates away from the area surrounding the island

779
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,080
They used to call him the Jamoca from Jamaica

780
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,040
Instead

781
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,560
You're gonna compliment the two flagrant two ones?

782
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,440
But what's Jamoca?

783
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:12,640
Jamoke

784
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,000
Never mind

785
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,000
Okay

786
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,520
Instead what he did is he decided to just demand money from pirates

787
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,840
To allow them to come on to land

788
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,080
Sure

789
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,000
So he just basically was like you got to pay me

790
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,600
Yeah he was running a protection racket

791
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,560
Basically yeah

792
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:30,320
He was an outrageous drunk and he declared martial law twice in a two-year span

793
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,880
Because of fears of a French invasion

794
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,120
Which it should be pointed out he was accused of collaborating with the French

795
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:37,920
Well

796
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,600
After all that until his death Morgan owned three slave plantations

797
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,280
And spent a whole bunch of his time trying to enslave more black Jamaicans

798
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:45,920
He sucked

799
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:51,360
Yeah yeah but uh you know now we venerate him for his booze I guess

800
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,600
Yeah

801
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,160
That's good

802
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,000
I would imagine that Alex knows him as a pirate on a bottle of rum

803
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,320
Yeah I very much doubt the true story of Captain Morgan is high on anybody's list

804
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:05,360
Although I would guess that if Alex knew some of these things he'd be like even more into him

805
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,880
That's pretty cool man

806
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:12,960
I would like to run my own island fortress and collaborate with the French to overthrow my own fucking home

807
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,760
Allegedly

808
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,080
Yes

809
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:14,720
It's unclear

810
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,600
Okay that's fair

811
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,280
So um Alex

812
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,720
I would hate to tarnish his name

813
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,840
Alex's big piece of evidence that he has really to go on

814
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:26,560
About McAfee and how this could not possibly this has got to be a murder

815
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,320
It's the one time he tweeted out that I would never commit suicide and if I die in a prison

816
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,160
It's because the United States government murdered me

817
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,440
Yeah yeah it's tweets

818
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,080
Okay

819
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:38,960
Now he's dead and all we have is his last communications this year and last year

820
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,520
And the year before saying he would never commit suicide

821
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,200
Here's another one from October of last year 2020

822
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,800
I am content here

823
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,600
I have friends the food is good all is well

824
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,600
This is in the Barcelona prison

825
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:57,520
Know that if I hang myself a la Epstein it will be no fault of mine

826
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:04,320
So that's a second time he's saying I will not commit suicide and if I die in prison it's a setup

827
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,400
That's the first instance that I heard in this report of Alex having

828
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,120
I don't know why he's saying this is the second time

829
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,720
I think it's probably an editing screw-up

830
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:12,960
Yeah

831
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,920
I'm not sure

832
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,080
So this tweet is probably the strongest evidence that Alex has that McAfee didn't kill himself

833
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,800
Since he said he wouldn't do that in October

834
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,960
I accept this as something that makes sense on its face but I also don't think it proves anything

835
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,200
John McAfee was one of the most unhinged unstable people in the public eye

836
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,920
And it isn't necessarily wise to take most of the things he says without a giant grain of salt

837
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,560
Okay

838
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,480
I can believe that in October he may have felt that he would never commit suicide

839
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,240
But that was also eight months ago

840
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,680
And a lot can change to a person's mental state over the course of eight months

841
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,240
Particularly if they're in a foreign prison and maybe without the drugs that they generally do

842
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,240
It could change your mindset

843
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,320
McAfee has had a long history of being arrested in foreign countries

844
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,880
Or being wanted in foreign countries and getting away and going on the run

845
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,440
When he was a person of interest in his neighbor's murder and beliefs

846
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,600
He fled the country and he got away with it

847
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:08,640
More notably in 2019 he was arrested and released when he docked his boat in the Dominican Republic

848
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,520
He was on the run from the United States for that old tax thing

849
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,640
And he'd taken to living on his yacht I guess in international waters

850
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,640
Like some goddamn Andy Daley character

851
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,840
Yeah that sounds fun

852
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,480
Yeah

853
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,520
To kill time on the boat McAfee posted some pictures of himself with a bunch of big old guns

854
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,120
This drew the attention to the Dominican Republic authorities when he tried to dock

855
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,240
So he was arrested and held for four days and then he was released

856
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,480
You know what I think about going on the run?

857
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,360
If I was running from the law I would try also very hard to not be noticed

858
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,200
Hmm See that would be part of my strategy of like

859
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,720
If I had the opportunity to tweet out something I would be like

860
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,280
Maybe people will notice this Yes

861
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,960
And I don't think I should do that

862
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,640
So you're saying that when you're on the run it's kind of like you're in the no flex zone

863
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:59,360
You know I might even change my name or at the very least get a new Twitter handle

864
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,360
I would try and get rid of that blue check mark

865
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:05,520
Yeah I think it doesn't serve your interests of being on the run

866
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,000
To like really publicize a bunch of

867
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,480
I'm living out on this boat with these giant guns

868
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,440
No one will ever catch me

869
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,920
This is impressing my Instagram followers

870
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,240
But might be working across purposes of my trying to be on the run

871
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,800
I think that might be why he got caught so many times

872
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,200
Maybe

873
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:25,760
Yeah

874
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,680
John McAfee has a history of getting in trouble and then the consequences just disappear

875
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,560
So in October just after he'd been arrested in Spain

876
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,560
If you're him there's no way you think you're going to be in jail for the next eight months

877
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,760
Let alone end up extradited to the United States after that

878
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,160
Totally

879
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:44,080
Him posting that tweet I can see that kind of as shit posting

880
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,160
I mean it might as well be him saying like

881
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,840
I'll probably find a way to escape in a week

882
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,240
Like that's what he's doing

883
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,040
Until some actual evidence can be presented to the contrary

884
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:58,400
I see no reason to think that the simplest explanation here is impossible

885
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,960
Like John McAfee's luck had run out

886
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,600
He was going to be returned to the United States and he was likely going to be in prison for years

887
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:10,640
He was a vagabond, a world traveler, a guy who flees countries and lives on boats

888
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:15,760
The prospect of long-term incarceration seems like exactly the thing that he would find intolerable

889
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,720
Yeah fuck that

890
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,120
There's a lot of questions that do remain to be answered

891
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:24,080
But making this a hit team murder I think is going to be a really uphill battle for Alex

892
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:28,000
Especially if the thing he's leading with is a tweet from eight months ago

893
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,320
Yeah

894
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,920
I don't know

895
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,000
I mean, because then you just get back to like

896
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,840
Really? Why? Why would they send a hit team?

897
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:38,800
Yeah

898
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,600
What's a hit team? You could be, I mean, you know

899
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,080
Also

900
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,280
Like for McAfee?

901
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:50,800
Also McAfee has very publicly on Twitter in interviews said that he has a dead man switch

902
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,040
Yeah

903
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,880
So like

904
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,360
Okay

905
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,000
Yeah

906
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,200
Okay fine

907
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,480
Yeah that's like okay anybody who would want to kill him presumably because he has some

908
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,400
kind of information that they want covered up

909
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:02,800
Yeah

910
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,760
Would be like oh wait

911
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,040
They don't want him to go on trial

912
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,640
Oh wait if he if he ends up getting killed then his wife is just going to release all of these

913
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,040
Sure

914
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,640
Docs or whatever

915
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,840
Yeah it's it's nonsense this is all just a spy novel

916
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,720
Yeah yeah

917
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,920
And it's sad because like ultimately the the story is a tragic one I think

918
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,560
Uh I mean you know to a certain extent you could just describe it as the

919
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,000
quick destruction of one man's mind

920
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,800
I don't know if it was that quick

921
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,600
Consequences

922
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,960
I think it's been long

923
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,480
When you give them a lot of money

924
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,560
I don't think it was quick

925
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:36,960
Well

926
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,320
This has been going on a while

927
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,120
No I mean his mind was destroyed fairly quickly

928
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,600
Perhaps

929
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,160
Yeah

930
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,320
So uh not only did he tweet once he tweeted another time too

931
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,400
Here's another one that was put out in November of 2019

932
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,720
So a year before the one in 2020

933
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,200
And I quote

934
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:53,600
Kidding

935
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,800
I like fucking whales

936
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,200
From US officials saying in effect we're coming for you McAfee

937
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,120
We're going to kill yourself

938
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,480
It's a nice turn of phrase

939
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,320
We're going to arc inside you

940
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,840
We're going to kill yourself

941
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,920
I got a tattoo today just in case I am suicide myself

942
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,720
I didn't

943
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,160
I was whacked

944
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,600
Check out my right arm

945
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:19,520
And there is again his tattoo with the money there and the whack saying why he was killed

946
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,840
Those tweets are real but also John McAfee was a delusional paranoid drug addict

947
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:27,840
Who promised to eat his own dick on tv as a way to promote cryptocurrency

948
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,000
Probably as part of a pump and dump activity

949
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,960
This isn't compelling evidence of anything

950
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,360
Like these tweets and him getting a tattoo that says dollar sign whacked

951
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,680
It's not evidence to me of anything other than McAfee was unwell

952
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,680
Yeah and maybe those weren't turns of phrase so much as typos and poor grammar

953
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,400
Swacked

954
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,000
Yeah could have something

955
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:57,520
Maybe I might not be so much the well-done authorly talents of McAfee

956
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,200
I would love if Alex did also try to go through McAfee's

957
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,400
Yeah just start reading

958
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,000
Just start going through his twitter follow

959
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,600
I'm trying to explain some of this shit

960
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,520
Yeah yeah go for it go for it

961
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,080
Let's let's all start talking about whale fucking

962
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,080
That's what needs to be in the public eye

963
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,240
So Alex needed to jump in front of this really fast

964
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:16,400
Right

965
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,880
He needed to get a narrative out and

966
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,480
Can't let the cement dry on this one

967
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:20,800
No

968
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,440
No no no

969
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,520
Within minutes of him being announced dead we're told it's a suicide

970
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,160
Just like we were told with Breitbart it was a heart attack before his body was even cold

971
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,920
And no coroner's examination

972
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,920
And the coroner that finally looked at him then was poisoned by arsenic and died

973
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,800
Political assassination is a very real thing in America a very real thing around the world

974
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,160
So we already talked about this the the outlets that Alex thinks are in on this

975
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,600
Conspiracy did not report that it was a suicide within minutes

976
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,200
There was dry matter-of-fact coverage of the Catalonian statement and then

977
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,960
Eventually Reuters reported the statement that was made by McAfee's lawyer

978
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,560
I strongly suspect that Alex's claim that within minutes it was called a suicide is

979
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,320
Based on random tweets he saw

980
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:00,720
That sounds

981
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,680
Which is meaningless

982
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,480
Most likely

983
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,760
We did a whole episode about the day after Andrew Breitbart died and

984
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,560
Nothing Alex is saying is real about that case either

985
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,320
The media didn't immediately call it a heart attack and the initial reporting that

986
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,560
It was suspected to be a heart attack

987
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,640
The place that came from and the direct line that everyone was quoting

988
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,600
Was a press release put out by Breitbart's own website

989
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,160
Yeah

990
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,640
There's no conspiracy there

991
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,800
As for the coroner thing that was just a conspiracy narrative that's based on nothing

992
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,360
This was about the death of Michael Cormier a person who worked at the coroner's office

993
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:37,120
The problem is that he had nothing to do with Breitbart's autopsy and the amount of arsenic

994
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:40,400
He had in his system was so large that one of the detectives on the case said

995
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,400
It would be impossible to poison someone without much arsenic without them noticing

996
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,520
And people were pretty confused by that case

997
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:47,760
Yeah

998
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,120
Yeah

999
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:53,200
Alex can't prove that Cormier's death was a poisoning or like an intentional poisoning

1000
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:53,840
Sure sure sure

1001
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,800
And he can't prove that Breitbart didn't die from a heart attack

1002
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,840
All he can do is pull at strings real or imagined in order to create a sensational storyline that

1003
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,720
Fits his purposes

1004
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,000
One of the most important aspects of this is the narrative that the media immediately calls

1005
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,200
These death suicides or in Breitbart's case a heart attack

1006
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,440
Because that implies that there's a cover-up

1007
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,800
And if there's a cover-up that means that there's something to cover up

1008
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,800
And that means that it's a murder

1009
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,280
Yep

1010
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:24,000
In Breitbart's case Alex was just making up that the media immediately called it a heart attack

1011
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,960
And in this case he's doing the same thing with McAfee's death

1012
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,440
It's a pattern of behavior that exists not because he's responding to real reporting

1013
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,640
But because he's operating from a pre-existing script

1014
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,000
Regardless of what any media outlet published about McAfee's death

1015
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,440
As soon as Alex heard that he was dead he knew the angle was

1016
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,840
That the media immediately called it a suicide

1017
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,160
Totally

1018
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,120
And that's suspicious

1019
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:45,840
Yeah

1020
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,240
The rest of this video is is kind of

1021
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:49,680
Bleh

1022
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,000
I mean here Alex is just defending himself

1023
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:52,960
This is nonsense

1024
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,920
Of course he's talking about himself

1025
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,040
I think the evidence is overwhelming that John McAfee was targeted

1026
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,960
He told us why and was killed in a Spanish prison

1027
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,160
For the cryptocurrency they believe he had or for other secrets

1028
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,160
But regardless his work will live on promoting libertarian ideas of basic freedom

1029
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,120
What like

1030
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,720
For the cryptocurrency they just want his money?

1031
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,640
He doesn't have that much money

1032
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,640
He might have a bunch of bitcoin or something

1033
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,520
I have no idea

1034
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,000
Sure

1035
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,240
But like

1036
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,880
I'm sure he has tons of money but the people we're talking about are like multi-billionaires

1037
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,720
McAfee wasn't a multi-billionaire

1038
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,720
Right right right

1039
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,840
If the globalists were trying to kill him for his money that's silly

1040
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:30,240
Yeah

1041
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:35,440
Second I don't it's not like you can kill someone and then automatically you just get their bitcoin

1042
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,120
No you see you don't understand how blockchain works

1043
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,640
I don't think Alex understands that

1044
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,880
It operates under highlander rules

1045
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:48,400
If you cut off somebody's head the power immediately it's the quickening it's the bitening

1046
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,640
It's basically like in Assassin's Creed when you have auto loot

1047
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,600
Yes exactly yeah yeah when it picks it up for you

1048
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,280
It's perfect

1049
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:03,440
Um yeah so Alex is saying that the evidence is overwhelming and and I I listen to this

1050
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,880
I see no evidence

1051
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,280
None

1052
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,040
I see a couple of tweets

1053
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:13,040
I see the most reasonable course of action being the explanation for events

1054
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:13,280
Yeah

1055
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,280
It's the one that makes the most sense to me

1056
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:15,520
Yeah

1057
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:22,160
I mean if I'm 75 I'm a globe traveling uh rich dude who's escaped over and over and over again

1058
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:22,640
You've gotten

1059
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,040
Now I'm

1060
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,680
You've gotten outrageously lucky

1061
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,240
Totally

1062
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:31,200
You've lived probably one of the most insane lives imaginable

1063
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:31,760
Absolutely

1064
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:36,400
Full of adventure in foreign countries uh ducking and dodging

1065
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:36,880
Totally

1066
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,240
Uh boxing above your weight class forever

1067
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,480
And what are you gonna what are you gonna get?

1068
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,680
You're gonna get another 10 years of life in an American prison?

1069
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:50,880
That's awful you don't want to do that so fucking offer yourself it makes sense

1070
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,120
I mean

1071
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:51,600
It does

1072
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,880
As tragic as that is and as much as I don't want to minimize

1073
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,560
you know people who are struggling with suicidal ideation

1074
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,320
There's no way out or anything like that

1075
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:08,960
It is imaginable to put yourself in McAfee's position and be like the indignity of the trial

1076
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:09,280
Yep

1077
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,960
The damage that the trial would do to the things that he has made the most important parts of his

1078
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,480
life like cryptocurrency

1079
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:16,720
Yep

1080
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,120
You could see taking the outdoor

1081
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:19,360
Yeah

1082
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,480
I don't know

1083
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,000
I think I'm not making any assumptions

1084
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,640
I'll let the information guide me to whatever conclusion is there

1085
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:35,920
But based on the statement from the Catalonian Justice Department

1086
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:40,560
Based on the statement from his lawyer that they are saying this is an apparent suicide

1087
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,200
Yeah

1088
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,840
I don't see a reason to doubt that

1089
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,680
The only reasons to doubt that are

1090
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:50,160
Nutty tweets from somebody who tweeted nutty shit all the time

1091
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:50,640
Yeah

1092
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,920
I'm not going to take that and that's not going to stand up in any kind of court

1093
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,360
Even the court of my mind

1094
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:01,360
Oh this lying liar said something? I guess I must believe it

1095
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:01,760
Yeah

1096
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,000
Yeah

1097
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,800
I got nothing here

1098
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:10,720
I think the further and maybe larger problem for me is I just don't care

1099
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,040
I just don't care that McAfee

1100
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,040
He's just not important

1101
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,240
He's like a sideshow

1102
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:22,160
It's like it's like a carnival barker and it's like

1103
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,720
I just don't see the power that Alex is thinking that he can wield through this

1104
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,520
Do you know what I mean?

1105
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:35,520
Yeah that I get what you're saying and I'm not super interested in the case itself

1106
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:39,280
As much as I am the behavior and what it illustrates

1107
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:39,760
Totally

1108
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:44,240
I think that the important thing to take away from this is really understanding that Alex put

1109
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:50,160
out this report that night because when we talk about that concrete idea the idea that

1110
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:55,360
when concrete is wet a leaf that falls on it could leave a permanent impression

1111
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:55,920
You got it

1112
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:02,480
And the information space is fairly similar and when a story when the details aren't out

1113
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:08,640
when there isn't like solidified information surrounding stuff you can make an indentation

1114
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,520
in that concrete

1115
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:14,800
Yeah a lot of people are gonna think that Subway has never used tuna in their sandwiches

1116
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,520
Exactly

1117
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,680
It's already happened it's too late now

1118
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:24,320
And with this Alex is trying to put into his audience's mind before there's any solid

1119
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:30,400
information that the media immediately reported that it was a suicide and that's suspicious

1120
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,880
because McAfee tweeted some crazy shit

1121
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,360
That's and that you know that it's a consistent behavior

1122
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:45,120
Yeah it's it's one of the most kind of worrying and disgusting things is that the conservative

1123
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:51,040
media has so insulated their listeners and viewers and the like that they can make claims

1124
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:56,320
about any other media because they know you're not going to go check you didn't listen you

1125
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:02,560
don't read the the papers what what person who is reading Infowars articles is then going

1126
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:07,680
to be like and now I'll switch over to the Reuters article that's not happening so you

1127
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:11,920
can just make any fucking claim that you want about what the media said because they'll

1128
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:17,600
believe anything you say about what the media said you own the mainstream media if you are

1129
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,800
in the conservative sphere

1130
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,480
It's a puppet that you can wield

1131
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,200
Exactly

1132
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:26,000
And even if you are like an Alex Jones listener and you go check the Reuters store you'll

1133
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,640
see the headline larger than life software mogul John McAfee dies in Spain by suicide

1134
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:34,480
lawyer says there you go and you'll ignore the part in the headline that says lawyer

1135
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:39,200
says why would you be like oh they are reporting that he died exactly you know and it's yeah

1136
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:46,080
it's it's it's a trap and it's a trap that's used intentionally yeah because the false

1137
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:51,360
version of this story or the presumptive version of this story is useful for Alex

1138
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:56,000
Yeah no it's one of their most powerful weapons controlling the narrative that they're telling

1139
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,920
you is the narrative they're selling that's just that's that's complete control over

1140
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:08,000
information yeah you know it's just it's just ironclad you can't escape from that so

1141
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,360
it's a real bummer

1142
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:16,800
So I think a lot of people probably were reflecting on some things when McAfee the news broke

1143
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:23,840
certainly I was taking a nap and I woke up and I had a text from a friend telling me

1144
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:28,000
about this news and my immediate response was well I bet Hillary did this

1145
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,040
Did Hillary do it?

1146
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,040
Um maybe

1147
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:37,040
Okay all right all right so jury's still out on that

1148
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:41,840
Yeah I think some people had some fun remembering that time he said that he was

1149
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,840
going to eat his dick on television

1150
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:44,640
That was good times

1151
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,840
But for Alex he had a slightly different response

1152
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,320
A lot of our interviews with him over the years were on YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook

1153
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:57,760
Dozens of them got banned and knocked off we never re-uploaded them to ban.video

1154
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:02,880
This reminded us to so we're going to create a John McAfee archive page and we'll post

1155
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,840
all the interviews we've done with him and any other interviews that are out there that

1156
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,800
have been censored and so we're going to put a few of the interviews on the tail end of

1157
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:13,360
this right now when we're shooting with him my first interview with him in 2012 and then

1158
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:18,080
we'll endeavor to post some of the other archives in a John McAfee section again at ban.video

1159
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,200
We're gonna juice this thing

1160
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:23,200
Oh man guys I just gotta let you know the iron's hot and we better be striking

1161
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:23,700
Yeah

1162
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:24,320
Jeez

1163
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:27,200
No one has told me that his Instagram posted a queue

1164
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,320
Quick! Quick! Exploit this! Quick!

1165
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:30,960
Shit

1166
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:36,000
We need a new page we need to get traffic to that page and we need to fill it with ads

1167
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,920
Uh somebody call Steve Pachanik and tell him to pretend he was on the yacht

1168
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,920
Yes exactly

1169
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,920
Uh all right

1170
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,560
I'm waiting to find out that Stevie P's is the one who orchestrated the assassination

1171
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,560
of McAfee

1172
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,560
He's been getting out of pocket

1173
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,560
Now my people in Catalonia

1174
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,560
Yeah exactly

1175
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,560
All right man

1176
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,560
So like you already sort of uh

1177
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:06,080
suspected and uh I think anyone would uh Alex does have to make this about himself

1178
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:06,580
Sure

1179
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:12,560
And you know it makes sense he's in a big season right now about how he's under threat

1180
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,060
Yes

1181
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:17,560
And the globalists are gonna come for him and they're gonna like kill his family and set him up for it or

1182
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,560
Of course, of course

1183
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,560
Whatever we heard this like a week ago on his show

1184
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:21,060
Makes sense

1185
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:25,560
And so he can't not take this opportunity to restress that theme

1186
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,560
Now just when in closing I want to say to listeners

1187
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:31,560
We've been getting a lot of threats a lot of attacks by the globalists as well

1188
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:35,560
They are making their move worldwide they are killing so many reporters so many journalists

1189
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:39,560
So it'll be a thousand percent a trillion percent clear to infinity

1190
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:43,560
I will never commit suicide I will never kill myself

1191
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:48,560
And if I'm found dead in a jail cell or if I'm found dead in a hotel room with a needle in my arm

1192
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:54,560
Or anything like that it is the deep state that did it and I want them held accountable

1193
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:59,560
If anything happens to me look at Bill Gates, Hillary Clinton, the deep state of the new world order

1194
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:05,560
They are the enemies of America the enemies of humanity and they're the ones that have long histories of serious criminal activity

1195
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,560
And never being held accountable

1196
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,560
So if anything happens to me the thunderbolt should strike me

1197
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,560
And what the godfather says, blame those people

1198
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:16,560
So you know, maybe it is Hillary?

1199
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,560
Could be, could be

1200
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,560
I would prefer if every time he was like

1201
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:28,560
If they find me with a needle in my arm if he just got really specific into what kind of drugs and alcohol he's doing

1202
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:32,560
If they find me in a hotel surrounded by three empty bottles of Jack Daniels

1203
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,560
You know they killed me

1204
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,560
That is their fault one hundred percent

1205
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,560
Because I'm a Jameson man

1206
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,560
Everyone knows it

1207
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:44,560
So this is the only actual content and analysis that Alex put out

1208
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,560
And it's as boilerplate as you can get

1209
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,560
There's more information that's yet to come out

1210
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,560
And Alex knows that once that information is available

1211
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,560
His job of rewriting this narrative is going to be next to impossible

1212
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:56,560
The only time to act is immediately

1213
00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:03,560
So you get this, a rushed formulaic meaningless insistence that McAfee didn't kill himself based on a couple of years old tweets

1214
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:10,560
It just doesn't matter, and this episode I think is still salient

1215
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:14,560
And I think it's important to do because it's important to recognize these tricks

1216
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,560
This is a key trick that Alex uses

1217
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:20,560
And the one thing that I find fucking exciting

1218
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:23,560
And I haven't, you know, we're recording this during the day on Thursday

1219
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:26,560
So we haven't had time to listen to the end of the week shows

1220
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:31,560
Of his, I want to know how he incorporates that cue on Instagram

1221
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,560
Because that's going to be tough

1222
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:38,560
Alex has already said that QAnon is a globalist intelligence operation

1223
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:41,560
Which seems like this is going to be something he has to either ignore

1224
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:46,560
Or maybe it's the globalists taunting people on McAfee's Instagram

1225
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,560
Could be, could be

1226
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:53,560
It could be that they put it on there to claim responsibility for his murder

1227
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:59,560
That way they put the cue on there so Alex knows that it's the globalists who are doing it

1228
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,560
Could be

1229
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,560
That could be an option for him

1230
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:06,560
It's going to be an interesting needle to see him thread

1231
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:12,560
And I'm excited to, I'm not really all that excited, but I think it'll be interesting

1232
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:17,560
Maybe actually we're just finally figuring out the real spelling of John McAfee

1233
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,560
It's M-Q-A-F-E-E

1234
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,560
And he had to change it for the software

1235
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:25,560
Maybe it's him admitting that he's Q

1236
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,560
It could be, I don't think so

1237
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,560
Probably not

1238
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:33,560
So that's it for the McAfee coverage

1239
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,560
Sort of exactly what you'd expect

1240
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,560
A little underwhelming

1241
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,560
Yeah

1242
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,560
Whatever

1243
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,560
Yeah, it would be nice if there was one

1244
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:46,560
You know, when the cement is this soft

1245
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,560
And you can really just pull off whatever you want

1246
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,560
I want one big swing

1247
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,560
You gotta give us at least one big swing

1248
00:55:52,560 --> 00:56:00,560
Of like a perpetrator, or a group of people, or something other than just like the globalists and Bill Gates

1249
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,560
And they want it as crypto

1250
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:06,560
Yeah, yeah, there needs to be a good story behind it that you've got

1251
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:09,560
You know, you can't just be like, oh well the media's lying

1252
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,560
You have to give me a better story

1253
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:13,560
Especially when you're lying about what the media's saying

1254
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,560
Yeah, when you're not even doing the bare bones of your job

1255
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:21,560
You're making up media coverage in order to justify your made up shit

1256
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:22,560
Right, right, right

1257
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,560
It's just stupid

1258
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:28,560
Give me something, give me like, oh, did you know that Brian Stelter was in Spain last month

1259
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:31,560
And then we're like, aha, now I've got it

1260
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,560
Give me something like that

1261
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:37,560
Somebody was in Spain around that time

1262
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,560
Is what you've got to give me

1263
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,560
Yeah, that would be good

1264
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:44,560
But no one was in Spain, however Alex was in New York

1265
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:45,560
Okay

1266
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:49,560
So we went down to do this Flagrant 2 podcast

1267
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:54,560
And, you know, I don't know, Flagrant 2 is a giant podcast

1268
00:56:54,560 --> 00:57:00,560
But at the same time it's still like Joe Rogan Jr. Varsity

1269
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,560
Sure, sure, sure

1270
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,560
For Alex

1271
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:05,560
He can't get on Rogan at least not regularly

1272
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:06,560
Not yet, yeah

1273
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:07,560
Or not enough

1274
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:08,560
Right

1275
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,560
And so, you know, he can get on Kill Tony

1276
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,560
Sure, sure

1277
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,560
That's not going to move the needle enough

1278
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,560
No, no it won't

1279
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,560
So, you know, you get this publicity tour

1280
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:20,560
He goes all the way to New York presumably either to do this podcast or to do this podcast

1281
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:21,560
And

1282
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:22,560
And something else

1283
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:25,560
Maybe have a deposition or something, who knows

1284
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:29,560
But, yeah, I just, I don't know

1285
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:34,560
It's really hard for me to cover these sorts of appearances that Alex does

1286
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:38,560
Because it's like, alright, I get that this is an attempt at a joke

1287
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:39,560
Right

1288
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,560
And I don't think it's funny

1289
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:42,560
Right

1290
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:43,560
And I think the subject matter sucks

1291
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:44,560
Yeah

1292
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,560
It's probably somewhere on the bigoted spectrum

1293
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:48,560
Yeah

1294
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:49,560
And whatever

1295
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:50,560
Sure

1296
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,560
You know, like

1297
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,560
Yeah

1298
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:53,560
I oppose, I oppose this joke

1299
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:57,560
I oppose the message that's underlying this joke

1300
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:01,560
But, I don't know, like where is the line of free speech?

1301
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,560
It's objectionable speech to me

1302
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:07,560
But, you know, YouTube should be able to decide whether they want it on the platform or not

1303
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,560
But in terms of

1304
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:09,560
Yeah

1305
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:14,560
In terms of our conversation it becomes, it becomes a total mess when you're trying to

1306
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:20,560
Criticize failed or iffy attempts at humor

1307
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:27,560
Yeah, I mean, it's, it's what, we don't cover shows that are just bros talkin' all too often

1308
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,560
Yeah

1309
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:33,560
You know, like, bros riffin' doesn't sound interesting or really that, that like, newsworthy I suppose

1310
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:36,560
The exception is like when Alex is on Rogan

1311
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,560
And that's just kind of like because it's a vent

1312
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:39,560
Yeah

1313
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:40,560
Level of

1314
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:41,560
Yeah

1315
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:44,560
And, and because Alex really goes for it

1316
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:45,560
He does

1317
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:52,560
And, and, and so like, I was listening to this and I was like, well, okay, we do cover Alex when he's on Rogan

1318
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:58,560
And so like, maybe this is something that we should, you know, like, he, he is a guest on this show

1319
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:02,560
Yeah, I mean if he makes, if he, if he's got something to say then I want to hear it

1320
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,560
If he doesn't have anything to say then

1321
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:05,560
He doesn't have much to say

1322
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:06,560
Well

1323
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:09,560
Um, I want to play like the beginning, this is how it starts

1324
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:15,560
Uh, Alex, uh, spoiler alert, comes out wearing tinfoil around his arms like bracers

1325
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:17,560
That is not funny

1326
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,560
What's up everybody and welcome to Flavor 2

1327
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:23,560
I am incredibly excited, we have a major, major guest

1328
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,560
Huge guest

1329
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:27,560
Huge guest, uh, probably one of the biggest actresses on the planet

1330
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:28,560
Icon

1331
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:34,560
We figured, a real icon, we figured because it is, uh, Women's Empowerment Month, I believe it's Women's Empower Month

1332
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:38,560
We bring on maybe the most powerful woman in the galaxy

1333
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:42,560
Some might say I'm incredibly excited, everybody right now give it up

1334
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:43,560
I wonder who it is

1335
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:47,560
For Gal Gadot, everybody, Wonder Woman is here, Flavor 2

1336
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,560
We got Wonder Woman in Wonder Woman

1337
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,560
We have Wonder Woman

1338
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:53,560
Yeah

1339
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:58,560
So Alex comes out with a bunch of tinfoil on him and it just turns into a protracted transphobic joke

1340
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:10,560
Uh, it's, it's a load of nonsense, but it's, I get this thing where it's, imagine right before they started recording

1341
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:16,560
Alex is like, here's what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna put on a wig and some tinfoil, I'm gonna pretend to be Wonder Woman

1342
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:21,560
Like, that's an idea he had, and then these guys were like, that'll be great

1343
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:22,560
We gotta do that

1344
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:23,560
That'll be great

1345
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:25,560
And you know what, we're gonna sell it

1346
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:26,560
Yes

1347
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:27,560
Oh boy

1348
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:28,560
And Alex taking his shirt off

1349
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:29,560
It's disconcerting

1350
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,560
You can take that, you can take that shirt off if you want, Alex

1351
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:32,560
Yo, just go dog

1352
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:33,560
You can go for it if you want

1353
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:36,560
I see you sweating, just go, just go

1354
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:37,560
There's the one

1355
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:42,560
Take it off, take it off, take it off

1356
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:44,560
You guys wanna see this woman's beautiful body?

1357
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:45,560
Yeah

1358
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,560
Yeah, show them fucking heavies

1359
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:54,560
Heavies, heavies, heavies, heavies, heavies, heavies

1360
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:56,560
Hey

1361
01:00:56,560 --> 01:01:01,560
Let's go, brother

1362
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:09,560
So it's moments like this that just like really highlight to me how much of like a duplicitous game everyone is playing

1363
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:10,560
Yeah

1364
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:13,560
Like, Alex is there to try to launder his extremist beliefs to a gullible audience

1365
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:16,560
And he's also trying to bring more customers into his revenue stream

1366
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:17,560
Of course

1367
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:23,560
Simultaneously, these dudes know that if you get Alex to do sensational things it leads to increased attention and traffic

1368
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:27,560
If you get him to run around without his shirt on you might end up going viral on Twitter

1369
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:33,560
You're like, that could be a meme, that could turn into something that is a long-lasting reaction gif meme or whatever

1370
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,560
That's better advertising than you could ever pay for

1371
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:36,560
Totally, totally

1372
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:42,560
So there's this whole game that both of them are playing that is promotional in nature

1373
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:52,560
And it's just like, okay, I guess you're trading the possibility of having these moments for willingly or unknowingly

1374
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:53,560
platforming a monster

1375
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:54,560
Pulling your audience to Alex

1376
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:55,560
Yeah, yeah

1377
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:56,560
It's like, okay, cool

1378
01:01:56,560 --> 01:02:06,560
I just can't believe that people would want to listen to the same social dynamic that one would see at a fucking elementary school

1379
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:08,560
Alex might as well be eating worms

1380
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:09,560
A drunk elementary school

1381
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:13,560
Yeah, just like, eat the worms, eat the worms, eat the worms

1382
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:14,560
It's the same fucking thing

1383
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:24,560
Alex is there to be humiliated for them to exploit and then they laugh at him and he acts, I mean it's so, it's so degrading

1384
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:25,560
No, no

1385
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:26,560
I'm degraded

1386
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:27,560
Well, you're gonna eat even more degraded

1387
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:28,560
Oh no

1388
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:29,560
Because Alex was about to talk about his dick

1389
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:30,560
Oh god

1390
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:32,560
Bro, you got a nice little bulge, yo

1391
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:35,560
Dude, you got a nice pecker, bro

1392
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:37,560
I have the largest micropenis in North America

1393
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:41,560
Now, women get blown away by it

1394
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:46,560
It looks like a grub worm with ear muscles

1395
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:55,560
You've seen like, seriously, those little balloons you buy at the store get really big

1396
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:56,560
That's me

1397
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:57,560
So you're a grower

1398
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:00,560
Man, women go, they go, this is a trick dick

1399
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:03,560
And then like, this hurts

1400
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:05,560
I got a trick dick

1401
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:08,560
So it starts out small and then surprises them later on

1402
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:09,560
It's like a turtle head, it goes in

1403
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:10,560
Yeah, yeah

1404
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:11,560
It actually goes in

1405
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:12,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1406
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:13,560
So then it comes out

1407
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:14,560
Aha

1408
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:22,560
This is not good riffing and it's unbecoming of someone in Alex's position to act like this

1409
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,560
Yeah, yeah

1410
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:28,560
It's just, imagine this juxtaposed with him fucking praying on air

1411
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:29,560
I

1412
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,560
I got a trick dick

1413
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:38,560
I mean, it's so much like, I immediately get flashbacks to like, early on doing standup

1414
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:43,560
Working with an established, clean comic headliner

1415
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:47,560
And it's me and a young female comic

1416
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:50,560
She and I are at about the same level of talent

1417
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,560
And then we're at the bar afterwards

1418
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:55,560
And he starts telling creepy ass fucking jokes right to her face

1419
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:56,560
Sure

1420
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,560
That is so fucked up and inappropriate

1421
01:03:58,560 --> 01:03:59,560
Yeah

1422
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,560
And you're like, this is not okay

1423
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,560
That is what I'm hearing Alex do right now

1424
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:10,560
That creepy ass shit where he presents himself one place as being a pious, god fearing man

1425
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:19,560
And then when there's a social situation where he can fucking take advantage of his goddamn position in the hierarchy

1426
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,560
To fuck around with people and I hate it

1427
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:22,560
Yeah

1428
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:23,560
It really lights me up

1429
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,560
I think that there's some of that

1430
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:31,560
And then there's some of it too that is just wanting to have people think that you're interesting by kind of like oversharing

1431
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:32,560
Yeah

1432
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:37,560
And I think that early on in my time doing standup I kind of was susceptible to that

1433
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:43,560
And I certainly would say more stuff on stage than I would be comfortable with now

1434
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:44,560
Sure

1435
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:49,560
You know like, there's sort of an extra version of like, let it all out there man

1436
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:51,560
Yeah, I'm a truth teller

1437
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:55,560
And I think that that was partially because a youth idiocy

1438
01:04:55,560 --> 01:05:01,560
And not taking myself seriously enough to know that this wasn't appropriate

1439
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:02,560
Yeah

1440
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:05,560
Alex is 47 years old

1441
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:06,560
Wow

1442
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:11,560
He's been doing this as a, he's been an investigative truth teller reporter for 27 years

1443
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:12,560
Yes

1444
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,560
He thinks he's fighting the literal devil

1445
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:15,560
Yeah

1446
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:17,560
He thinks that governments want to kill him

1447
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:18,560
Yep

1448
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:21,560
And he's still like, acts like I did

1449
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:22,560
Hey, you gotta laugh

1450
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:24,560
When I was an early doing comedy guy

1451
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:27,560
Look Dan, you know what, when you're so stressed out you need an outlet

1452
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:34,560
And that outlet is telling two weird bros while they mock you to your face that you've got a weird penis

1453
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:36,560
That makes perfect sense

1454
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:37,560
I guess

1455
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:45,560
I mean it should, I guess if people want to look at him as an

1456
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:46,560
Yeah

1457
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:47,560
I don't know

1458
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:57,560
The thing that I kept flashing to was these people like these hosts of Flagrant

1459
01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:02,560
And I would say even Rogan probably is this way

1460
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,560
Or Tony Hinchcliffe

1461
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:08,560
They have an image of Alex as this

1462
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:09,560
Yeah

1463
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:13,560
The drunk guy who talks about his dick or yells about aliens

1464
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:17,560
Or like tells them some weird subsection they've never heard of

1465
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:20,560
And he's like, I'm gonna blow your mind, I'm gonna blow your mind, let me tell you

1466
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:23,560
I'm gonna tell you, I talked to the weather weapon guy

1467
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:24,560
Yeah, yeah

1468
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:27,560
That's the image that they have of him

1469
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:30,560
And that's what they think his show is

1470
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:34,560
They haven't listened to his actual show

1471
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:35,560
Probably not, no

1472
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,560
They don't know

1473
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:43,560
And when Alex comes on these types of shows, he's not crying about fighting the devil

1474
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:44,560
Right

1475
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:47,560
He's not like yelling all his racist shit

1476
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:50,560
He's not doing what he does on his show

1477
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:55,560
If these people actually listened to Alex's show, they would either be bored out of their mind

1478
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:59,560
Or they'd be like, wait a second, this is what Alex does?

1479
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:02,560
I'm not sure I want to be associated with this

1480
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:03,560
You know, I don't know

1481
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:09,560
Alex's years-long Trojan horse quest to get people to give their life to Jesus

1482
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:16,560
Do you think that people like these hosts would be like, oh, I want to be a part of this

1483
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:18,560
Bringing people to God

1484
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:20,560
I mean, I could see this

1485
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,560
I could see them all in their mind

1486
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:23,560
Because they are all these

1487
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:31,560
I mean, the names of the people that we're dealing with are all traffickers in toxic masculinity by trade

1488
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:37,560
So I could definitely see them being like, oh, you know, we just play it up on our show

1489
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:39,560
Alex just plays it up on his show

1490
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:41,560
And in real life, he's this guy

1491
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,560
So it's okay for us to be cool with him

1492
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:48,560
Despite not realizing all of the fucking destruction that his show does

1493
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:53,560
Just because he's a character on the show means it's okay for them to be like

1494
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:55,560
Eh, you know what, we'll have him on our show

1495
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:57,560
Where he's the real guy

1496
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:58,560
See, that's great

1497
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:00,560
And I applaud that, except the reverse

1498
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:02,560
Yeah, I was gonna say, please do not applaud that

1499
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:03,560
No, I think it's worse

1500
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:04,560
That's fucked up

1501
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:06,560
Yeah, if someone were to make that argument, I think that

1502
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:08,560
That's what I'm saying

1503
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:11,560
I'm saying these people are worse than you give them credit for

1504
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:16,560
Yes, because if the argument is that it's a character and this is the real Alex

1505
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,560
That we're hanging out with, broing down with about our dicks

1506
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:23,560
Like, okay, then that person that you're broing down with is a psychopath

1507
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:25,560
Yes, yes

1508
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:27,560
And they are too

1509
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:31,560
I mean, you could absolutely see them saying something like

1510
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:35,560
The crisis actor joke is funny because it's not Alex's fault

1511
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:38,560
It's people taking Alex too seriously

1512
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,560
Who went too far with all that Sandy Hook stuff

1513
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:43,560
Alex is an entertainer, man

1514
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:46,560
If people take it too seriously, it's not Alex's fault

1515
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:49,560
Just like when people take our stuff too seriously

1516
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,560
And it's like, no, we're making a joke

1517
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:55,560
Sure, I made a quote unquote joke about raping a woman

1518
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:59,560
But that was a joke, I don't know why people are taking it too fucking seriously

1519
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:01,560
It's that type of shit

1520
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:04,560
They even do, you know, touch on that a little bit

1521
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:07,560
Everybody takes me out of context

1522
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,560
I find that to be a pretty boring argument

1523
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:14,560
Because I've listened to hundreds and hundreds of hours of Alex's show

1524
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:19,560
I think I got a pretty good sense of what's an actual position and what's him fucking around

1525
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:23,560
And I don't take things that he's fucking around about all that seriously

1526
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:26,560
I think that argument is thin

1527
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:31,560
No, I would say it's a self-serving and delusional argument

1528
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,560
That helps you go to sleep at night

1529
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:38,560
Because what you're actually doing is exposing people to a fucking monster

1530
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:43,560
And you're helping make it easier for people to accept the bad arguments

1531
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:46,560
And the awful things that Alex does believe

1532
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:50,560
By presenting him in a way that's positive, that's sociable

1533
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:53,560
That is like, hey, we're having fun

1534
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:59,560
And allowing him to perpetuate things that just explicitly aren't true

1535
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:03,560
It's like if Renfield had a fucking podcast

1536
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:05,560
Like, he's putting Dracula on, man

1537
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:07,560
He's gonna push Dracula on you

1538
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:11,560
Well, I mean, if you want to use Alex's own language

1539
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:16,560
But there's just things that you allow him to perpetuate that aren't true

1540
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:20,560
So they're talking about Colbert and why Colbert isn't funny anymore

1541
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,560
And here's what Alex says

1542
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:27,560
They admit Charles Schumer, the Senator of New York calls him and says what should be in his bits

1543
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:28,560
No

1544
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:29,560
That's in the news

1545
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:30,560
Same thing with

1546
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:31,560
That's almost unbelievable

1547
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:33,560
Some of the funnier late night guys, you should be really funny

1548
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:34,560
You wonder, why aren't they funny now?

1549
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:38,560
They admit in the news that they get calls from Democrat spokespersons

1550
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:41,560
And Senator Schumer goes, I'd like you to talk to this guy

1551
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:44,560
He's my cousin, he's a funny guy

1552
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:48,560
And those guys know that corporately, their job and their contract is

1553
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:50,560
Pursuant to a weird New York Senator

1554
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,560
Can you imagine like a Senator calls up

1555
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,560
Oh, Andrew, I'd kind of like to see this in your piece

1556
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:55,560
You say, fuck you, man

1557
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:56,560
Yeah

1558
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:59,560
Can you imagine like, I'm out here like, okay, Senator Schumer says I'm supposed to say this now

1559
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:00,560
Here's Schumer's joke

1560
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:04,560
So this old man can sit there and watch and go, I control that young man

1561
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:10,560
This is entirely about Jimmy Kimmel discussing on air how he'd spoken with Chuck Schumer about the Affordable Care Act

1562
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:14,560
Which you might recall was a super important thing to Jimmy because his son lives with a congenital heart defect

1563
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:18,560
So he was discussing on air, this piece that he did

1564
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:23,560
About how the coverage of pre-existing conditions really matters in a very concrete way

1565
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:24,560
Yes

1566
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,560
Kimmel was taking issue with the Graham-Cassidy bill

1567
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:29,560
Which sought to get rid of some of the provisions of the ACA

1568
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:34,560
And in preparation he got some assistance from Chuck Schumer's office about the bill's details

1569
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,560
Alex has taken that kernel from 2017 and embellished it now

1570
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:43,560
To the point where he's telling these dudes that Schumer is basically the booker and head writer for all late night shows

1571
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:47,560
This isn't joking around and it's not even in the territory of embellishment for effect

1572
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:52,560
This is just a lie that Alex is specifically deploying to convince these people's audience

1573
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:57,560
That all non-crazy entertainment is just secret globalist programming

1574
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:03,560
And they're reacting to it with like, no way, that's almost unbelievable

1575
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:08,560
And you're like, why wouldn't you stop for one second and go, that is unbelievable

1576
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,560
No

1577
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:16,560
I mean Alex even gave you an example for you to be like, I know people in comedy

1578
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:20,560
Of course they too would say, fuck you Chuck Schumer, you're not funny

1579
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:25,560
And the hosts of this show, the two dudes who are the main hosts of it

1580
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:30,560
One of them used to be on MTV's Guy Code and the other one was on Wild and Out

1581
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:34,560
So it's like, they're comedians, people who have worked, they have done stuff

1582
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,560
You know people in the industry

1583
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:40,560
All of whom would do, regardless of whatever political affiliation you have

1584
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:45,560
Comedians are very very aggressive about you shutting the fuck up

1585
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:51,560
And they probably have some exposure to some of the things that Alex is being completely duplicitous about

1586
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:56,560
And it's just not worth it to have an actual conversation about it, I don't think

1587
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:00,560
If you've been on the Guy Code or Wild and Out or that kind of stuff

1588
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:07,560
There's no way you haven't interacted with people who literally work at SNL or Colbert or the like

1589
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:12,560
Like, that's, they're there, they're everywhere, yeah, I mean, that's bananas

1590
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,560
And that means you know Chuck Schumer

1591
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:17,560
Yeah, well, that means they're taking orders from Chuck Schumer

1592
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:23,560
Yeah, so I found largely listening to this to be, like I have already said, intolerable

1593
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:29,560
I found it so boring, just ha ha ha

1594
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:32,560
That's the kind of noise, just put that for two and a half hours

1595
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,560
Look at us being bros

1596
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,560
Yeah, so I turned it off after about an hour

1597
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:42,560
But there was one really important thing that came up a couple times in the first hour

1598
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:48,560
And this is Alex trying to formulate a way to justify some of his bigotries

1599
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:51,560
And I found this really really interesting

1600
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:52,560
Here we go

1601
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:57,560
Because all the Renaissance is, it's not a utopia, it's saying all the old fucking weird shit, we throw it out

1602
01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:00,560
All the old weird shit's like, oh rainbow flags, oh look, black people

1603
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:02,560
It's all exploiting gay people and black people

1604
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,560
There's nothing to do with rainbow flags and gay people

1605
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,560
They're just literally sitting there putting that out

1606
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:11,560
We need a total Renaissance to overthrow the entire thing and empower everybody

1607
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:14,560
Well you're saying, you're not saying let's get rid of rainbow flags and black people

1608
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:15,560
That's what it sounded like

1609
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:18,560
You're saying they're mascotting the rainbow flags and the black people

1610
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,560
No, yeah, get rid of the front

1611
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:24,560
Imagine if I walked in here and I said, I really like black people

1612
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,560
Do what I say, I like black people

1613
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,560
You're a fucking opportunist

1614
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,560
I see what you're saying, I see what you're saying

1615
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:31,560
But this is interesting

1616
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:34,560
No, no, I'm saying don't get rid of rainbow flags and black people

1617
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:37,560
No, get rid of the people that are using rainbow flags and black people

1618
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:39,560
I'm just saying stop listening to them

1619
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:44,560
Like when some defense contractor has a rainbow flag you're like, dude, that's not you

1620
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:47,560
You're killing people but you're using this rainbow flag so we think you're

1621
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:48,560
That's protection

1622
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:57,560
I've listened to countless hours of Alex's show and I honestly don't think that that's an idea that I've ever heard him articulate like that

1623
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,560
I really haven't either

1624
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:00,560
I think it's intentional

1625
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:05,560
This is a very attractive point and honestly I don't actually disagree that much with how he's framing it

1626
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:11,560
No, I think he's, well, I mean you see Nancy Pelosi and the like in a fucking, yeah, yeah

1627
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:18,560
I see, you know, businesses do pay lip service to communities in meaningless ways in order to garner goodwill

1628
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:23,560
While their actions might not be as supportive as those words may imply

1629
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:28,560
Rainbow flags and donations to Trump do not go together and yet somehow

1630
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:32,560
I think that happens a lot and it's a part of the shallowness of the nature of corporations

1631
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:37,560
We treat corporations like people and all of a sudden they have a brand and a persona to cultivate

1632
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:39,560
And part of that is trite social media gestures

1633
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:41,560
And I think a lot of people see through that

1634
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:46,560
By framing Alex's opposition to things like black people and rainbow flags this way

1635
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:51,560
Alex is trying to hook the audience by appealing to something that they could easily believe

1636
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:56,560
This could possibly be the belief that Alex has that everyone says is racist

1637
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,560
You know all those times Alex gets called a racist?

1638
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:04,560
It's gotta be because people are misrepresenting his stance against corporate use of Black Lives Matter and rainbow flags

1639
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,560
That's gotta be it, he's not actually a racist

1640
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:12,560
That's what Alex wants the audience to think because the reality is that Alex is a gigantic racist

1641
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:17,560
And if the audience knows that going in, they won't ever make it to the Infowars store

1642
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:23,560
Trust me, the difference in how Alex responds to a murder when the victim is black or when the victim is white

1643
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:25,560
Has nothing to do with corporate signaling

1644
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:30,560
His behavior is explicitly racist, it's homophobic, it's transphobic

1645
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:39,560
He is those things and he's being allowed to launder this in a way that's appealing to not only the hosts but the audience

1646
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:43,560
And gives them a way to be like, oh yeah everyone says Alex is racist

1647
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:52,560
He doesn't like this corporate thing where you put a rainbow flag up during Pride Month when you're a bigot

1648
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:54,560
Or you're doing horrible things

1649
01:16:54,560 --> 01:17:02,560
It's a valid criticism that's trying to be used as a shield for bigotry

1650
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:05,560
Right, but I mean that's the feedback loop

1651
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:10,560
That's the feedback loop of conspiracy theorists and shitty politicians

1652
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:14,560
Is that when the system is so corrupt and so transparent bullshit

1653
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:21,560
It is easy for you to take a pot shot like this and get people towards more conspiratory laden bullshit

1654
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:25,560
Because obviously Nancy Pelosi is fucking lying to you

1655
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:27,560
That's not hard to jump to

1656
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:35,560
It's a miniature version of how Alex's opposition to the Iraq war can trick you into thinking that he is an ally

1657
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:37,560
Or ideologically on the same page

1658
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:43,560
Right, and then corrupt and shallow assholes use that conspiracy theory to get elected

1659
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:47,560
When they corrupt the government and make it less functional than it was before

1660
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:52,560
Then your conspiracy theories get even stronger because the government is so obviously corrupt

1661
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:55,560
And it creates that feedback loop of destruction

1662
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:58,560
If it were possible, I mean I've said this so many times

1663
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:02,560
But the greatest weapon that the Democrats have against the Republican party

1664
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:06,560
Is just the governing effectively and they cannot do that

1665
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:07,560
They simply cannot

1666
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:08,560
True

1667
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,560
And that's why we get into these situations

1668
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:17,560
I think that even if the Democrats wanted to or had a unified will to govern well

1669
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:18,560
I don't think it's possible

1670
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:19,560
No, that's probably true

1671
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:21,560
It's probably too late now

1672
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:23,560
It's probably way too late now

1673
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:25,560
Everyone can just do their best

1674
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:27,560
Man, they really had a shot

1675
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:29,560
They really had a shot 2008 to 2010

1676
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:32,560
If they had just got their shit together

1677
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:35,560
Man, we would have avoided so much

1678
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:38,560
We would have had a right wing terrorism problem

1679
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:39,560
Yeah, that's true

1680
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:41,560
We would have had an extreme much faster

1681
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:43,560
Yeah, it wasn't going to stop

1682
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:51,560
Yeah, so I just, I grow weary of these laundering attempts of Alex

1683
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:56,560
And I just, I don't think people don't have the right to do it

1684
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:57,560
Sure

1685
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:02,560
I don't think people are, you know, should be banned

1686
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,560
I don't know, I mean it's the platform's choice

1687
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,560
They can do whatever the fuck they want

1688
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:07,560
Sure

1689
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:13,560
I don't think that, you know, I don't think they should be arrested or anything for this

1690
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:17,560
But I wish people would consider a little bit more what they're doing

1691
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:24,560
I wish that, like, if these guys want to have Alex Jones on their show

1692
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:27,560
I would like them to ask about the devil

1693
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:32,560
I would like them to ask about, like, valid criticisms about him

1694
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:39,560
As opposed to allowing him to present his very, very clear racism as opposition to corporate signaling

1695
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:40,560
Right

1696
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:45,560
I would like it if they allow, you know, this is a rare opportunity

1697
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:50,560
Where you have Alex there, you could ask him digging questions

1698
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:55,560
And instead just allow him to poach your audience

1699
01:19:55,560 --> 01:20:00,560
I mean, there's really only, at this point the bar is so low

1700
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:04,560
So there's only two things that happen if you have Alex Jones on

1701
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:05,560
It's obviously you're right

1702
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:11,560
You have either the option to fucking eviscerate him

1703
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:15,560
And then you will not be on his level, you will be over the bar

1704
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:19,560
Or you do this, in which case you are under the bar right next to Alex

1705
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:22,560
I have no sympathy for people

1706
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:27,560
You've turned flagrant 2 into Infowars in my mind

1707
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:28,560
More or less

1708
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:29,560
The end

1709
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:31,560
Like, I have no interest in you as people

1710
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:33,560
You should fucking stop

1711
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:36,560
And if you don't get that and if you don't make a change towards that

1712
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,560
Then fuck off forever

1713
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:39,560
You're just Infowars

1714
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:45,560
Yeah, I think we have probably a very unique perspective

1715
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:48,560
And I don't mean unique in, like, necessarily an overly positive way

1716
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:52,560
But a perspective that other people don't have because we focus so much on Alex Jones

1717
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:53,560
Sure

1718
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:57,560
And that is that, like, I think that we have enough of an awareness of what this dude does

1719
01:20:57,560 --> 01:21:03,560
And what he's up to, his history, the way he lies, the positions that he actually has

1720
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:08,560
That people who would choose to associate with him

1721
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:11,560
It's your right to

1722
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:12,560
Sure

1723
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:15,560
But we know that you are him

1724
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:16,560
Yeah, yeah

1725
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:22,560
I don't give a fuck about Joe Rogan or Tim Dillon or these fucks or any of these people

1726
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:25,560
You are next to Alex Jones forever

1727
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:29,560
You're at the rally, if you're at a rally surrounded by Nazis

1728
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:31,560
I get maybe you feel like you're not

1729
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:34,560
But if you stay at that rally, guess who's a Nazi now

1730
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:35,560
You have Alex on a second time

1731
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:36,560
Exactly

1732
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:40,560
I mean, I guess it probably boosts numbers

1733
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,560
It probably helps with traffic

1734
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:45,560
And these guys have a bunch of ads on their show

1735
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:46,560
Hey

1736
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:49,560
Hope their sponsors don't dislike Alex being on

1737
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:53,560
It's okay if you destroy the world if your listeners go up

1738
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:54,560
It's fine

1739
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:55,560
It's the trade-off

1740
01:21:55,560 --> 01:22:04,560
I just don't understand being this irresponsible with presentation

1741
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:05,560
Yeah

1742
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:07,560
That's really what it comes down to

1743
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:12,560
It really comes down to like a part of you just breaks down and you just go like

1744
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,560
Do you guys just not care?

1745
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:17,560
Like is that really it? You just don't give a shit?

1746
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:22,560
I mean it feels like that's got to be the most simple explanation

1747
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,560
Yeah, you don't care about your show

1748
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:26,560
You don't care about the people who listen

1749
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:28,560
And you don't care about what happens because of it

1750
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:31,560
That's what you're telling me when you have Alex Jones on

1751
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:38,560
Right, I mean like because here we have a completely dissonant presentation

1752
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:43,560
A week ago on his show, Alex is talking about how we're all dead

1753
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:47,560
Yes he was

1754
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:48,560
Yes he was

1755
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:52,560
He's talking about how the globalists are going to kill everybody

1756
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:53,560
Yeah

1757
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:56,560
And you know like I gotta stand and fight against these

1758
01:22:56,560 --> 01:23:02,560
I promise you I will take everything in my ability and fake crying and shit

1759
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:05,560
And within the week he's in New York wearing a wig

1760
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:08,560
Hey my penis is like a turtle

1761
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,560
It's great, great

1762
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:11,560
What are you doing?

1763
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:13,560
What are any of us doing?

1764
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:14,560
Yeah

1765
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,560
Brutal

1766
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:20,560
And then Alex comes back and tries to present McAfee's death as a murder

1767
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,560
Which can only serve to incite his audience

1768
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:23,560
Yeah just unreal

1769
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:25,560
This is just nonsensical

1770
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:27,560
It's just so fucked up

1771
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:33,560
It's so fucked up how easy it is to jangle the keys of like

1772
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:37,560
Hey I'm a fucking performer in front of these idiots

1773
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:40,560
And then they'll just be like hey let's talk about dicks for two hours

1774
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,560
Fuck off

1775
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:46,560
And again maybe I don't know I watched most of the first one

1776
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,560
And it was not in depth or interesting

1777
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:50,560
Yeah

1778
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:53,560
I watched the first hour of this one before I turned it off

1779
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:58,560
And the only thing I found interesting really was this presentation of Alex's racism

1780
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:01,560
As being opposed to corporate artifice

1781
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:02,560
Yeah

1782
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:07,560
And I don't know I guess I could have listened to the rest of it

1783
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:08,560
Meh

1784
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:15,560
Yeah I mean again if it weren't so reasonable to assume that they are corrupt lying pieces of shit

1785
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:20,560
I think it would be harder to launder your racism behind

1786
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:22,560
See look at those corrupt lying pieces of shit

1787
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:26,560
I would like it if this was actually a long game which it's not

1788
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:29,560
But they were trying to lull Alex into a false sense of security

1789
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:33,560
Yeah you missed the last half hour where they just fucking nailed him

1790
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:35,560
Nailed him to a wall

1791
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:37,560
I doubt it

1792
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:38,560
Anyway

1793
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:39,560
Anyway

1794
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:45,560
I'm somewhat excited to see how Alex tries to incorporate that cue from John McAfee's Instagram

1795
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:48,560
So we'll check in on that on Monday I believe

1796
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:49,560
Yeah

1797
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:52,560
But yeah until then Jordan we have a website

1798
