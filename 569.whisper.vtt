N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Knowledge Fight

00:12.880 --> 00:17.920
Damn and Jordan, I am sweating

00:17.920 --> 00:21.040
knowledgefight.com, it's time to pray

00:21.040 --> 00:23.760
I have great respect for knowledge fight

00:23.760 --> 00:24.720
knowledge fight

00:24.720 --> 00:27.080
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

00:27.080 --> 00:28.640
saying we are the bad guys

00:28.640 --> 00:29.920
knowledge fight

00:29.920 --> 00:32.080
Damn and Jordan, knowledge fight

00:32.080 --> 00:34.240
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her

00:34.240 --> 00:36.320
I need, I need money

00:36.320 --> 00:39.200
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her

00:39.200 --> 00:42.080
Andy and Kansas, Andy and, Andy and

00:42.080 --> 00:44.560
Stop it, Andy and, Andy and Kansas

00:44.560 --> 00:46.960
Andy, Andy, it's time to pray

00:46.960 --> 00:49.200
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding

00:49.200 --> 00:51.600
Hello Alex, I'm a victim, calling in my huge fan

00:51.600 --> 00:52.800
I love your work

00:56.800 --> 00:59.280
I love you

00:59.280 --> 01:01.280
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan

01:01.280 --> 01:01.920
I'm Jordan

01:01.920 --> 01:08.080
We're a couple dudes, like to sit around to worship at the altar of Selene and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

01:08.080 --> 01:09.520
Oh indeed we are, Dan

01:09.520 --> 01:11.440
I was about to say Psalter of Selene

01:11.440 --> 01:13.520
I heard it, I was gonna let it go

01:13.520 --> 01:14.640
Not good

01:14.640 --> 01:17.440
But you know, now that you've brought it up, I noticed

01:17.440 --> 01:18.800
Yeah, how you doing?

01:18.800 --> 01:20.560
Dan, I have a quick question for you

01:20.560 --> 01:23.360
What is your bright spot for today?

01:23.360 --> 01:25.520
My bright spot today, Jordan, very exciting announcement

01:25.520 --> 01:26.160
Yes sir

01:26.160 --> 01:30.640
So this is something I've been meaning to get to for a while, there have been technical difficulties

01:30.640 --> 01:32.960
Which is code for my printer hasn't worked

01:32.960 --> 01:33.840
Sure

01:33.840 --> 01:40.320
I've been wanting to do this again, we did it like maybe a couple months back, six months back

01:40.320 --> 01:44.720
Gave some buttons to folks, sent them out, and I wanted to do another run of these

01:44.720 --> 01:48.400
We have some new designs themed around the cult of Selene

01:48.400 --> 01:49.360
Excellent

01:49.360 --> 01:55.760
And I would like to announce officially that we're gonna be doing another run of these buttons

01:55.760 --> 01:57.920
for folks, and here's how it's gonna work

01:57.920 --> 02:01.120
Because last time this completely screwed up all of my inboxes

02:02.000 --> 02:03.600
And I am not interested in that

02:03.600 --> 02:04.560
A little bit, yeah

02:04.560 --> 02:08.800
So I've started a new email address that is specifically for this

02:08.800 --> 02:12.720
You do not have to be someone who gives to the show, you do not have to be

02:12.720 --> 02:17.120
anything, just anybody, if you would send your email, your address, I will

02:17.120 --> 02:19.120
You do have to be capable of email

02:19.120 --> 02:21.520
That is the one limitation on this

02:21.520 --> 02:24.960
And you have to send me an address to send a button to

02:24.960 --> 02:25.600
Well true

02:25.600 --> 02:29.680
And then I will take care of everything else and you will have a button sent to you

02:29.680 --> 02:34.880
The email address is kfbusiness at gmail.com

02:34.880 --> 02:39.440
And that's spelled K-F-B-I-Z-N-E-S-S

02:40.800 --> 02:42.400
KF business

02:42.400 --> 02:44.880
Let's KF to business

02:44.880 --> 02:45.840
At gmail.com

02:45.840 --> 02:53.040
If you send an address to that, there's gonna be a little bit of time, you know, obviously

02:53.040 --> 02:53.600
Sure

02:53.600 --> 02:56.000
Gotta make these up so there could be a little bit of a delay

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
But we will get this in the works, get some envelopes with your addresses on them

03:00.000 --> 03:01.680
And get these buttons sent out to you

03:01.680 --> 03:02.480
I'm very excited

03:02.480 --> 03:06.480
I really, I know that last time we did this, one of the things that I discovered was

03:06.480 --> 03:09.440
I was really, really enjoying the process of making buttons

03:09.440 --> 03:11.280
You loved the meditation of buttons

03:11.280 --> 03:16.720
Yes, there was a thing too, the crafting of it and the sort of, the repetitive

03:16.720 --> 03:17.440
Sure, sure

03:18.640 --> 03:19.840
Zen and the art of button making

03:19.840 --> 03:25.280
Yeah, yeah, and I feel like we're in a safer place now too

03:25.280 --> 03:28.080
There's a lot of precautions that we took the last time around

03:28.080 --> 03:28.400
True

03:29.040 --> 03:34.000
With wearing gloves while making the buttons and everything

03:34.000 --> 03:38.880
And now it feels a little bit, you know, we can chill out a little bit and just send out a nice gift

03:38.880 --> 03:39.920
Just send out some buttons

03:39.920 --> 03:41.280
Yeah, so I'm very excited about that

03:41.280 --> 03:44.480
And if you all want to send in some addresses, we'll get those buttons your way

03:44.480 --> 03:48.960
Yeah, now admittedly this time his gloves will be on and they will be coated with anthrax

03:48.960 --> 03:50.880
So it's a little bit of a different problem

03:50.880 --> 03:53.760
I met an Elvis impersonator and he had some ideas

03:54.960 --> 03:56.960
What about you Jordan, what's your bright spot?

03:56.960 --> 04:01.120
My bright spot is, it's low, it's in the early stages

04:01.120 --> 04:02.640
It's not a super bright spot

04:02.640 --> 04:09.760
But after a year of writing nothing but mean things to Taylor Swift and stories about wizards

04:10.640 --> 04:12.800
I've started a new project

04:12.800 --> 04:13.520
That's great

04:13.520 --> 04:14.480
It's much larger

04:15.040 --> 04:18.400
Hopefully it'll be about the size of the book I put out last year

04:18.400 --> 04:19.760
So that's spectacular

04:19.760 --> 04:22.800
Yeah, and if it's any longer people will definitely not finish it

04:22.800 --> 04:24.240
So I'm fine with that

04:24.240 --> 04:26.000
Here's the inspiration

04:26.000 --> 04:27.280
Yes, I'm very excited

04:27.280 --> 04:27.920
Clink

04:27.920 --> 04:29.120
Yes, absolutely

04:29.120 --> 04:30.480
Well, I wish you the best with that

04:30.480 --> 04:31.680
Yes, me too

04:31.680 --> 04:37.520
So Jordan, today we have an episode to go over and it's a little bit of a challenge

04:39.680 --> 04:41.680
It was a tough challenge for me

04:42.400 --> 04:43.600
And here's what happened

04:43.600 --> 04:44.000
Okay

04:44.000 --> 04:48.720
So Jordan, Alex was out of studio at the beginning of this week

04:49.520 --> 04:51.040
He was in New York

04:51.040 --> 04:51.540
Sure

04:52.000 --> 04:53.040
I mean, I think you're

04:53.040 --> 04:54.560
Is he allowed in New York?

04:55.120 --> 04:56.960
Maybe, yeah

04:56.960 --> 04:59.680
Doesn't Letitia have people on the border?

04:59.680 --> 05:04.480
Well, see, I think that a lot of people probably, that's the first thing their mind would go to

05:05.040 --> 05:09.360
Is that he's probably going to deal with some sort of a legal issue with

05:09.360 --> 05:12.320
the attorney general of New York, Letitia James

05:12.320 --> 05:15.520
Who he has threatened on air multiple times

05:15.520 --> 05:19.760
And of course, he had the cease and desist for some of the products that he was selling

05:20.880 --> 05:24.400
And I think that there is a possibility that that's the case

05:24.960 --> 05:28.880
You know, like, you suspiciously went to Connecticut

05:28.880 --> 05:30.480
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah

05:30.480 --> 05:32.400
Recently, it's like, oh, why'd you go there?

05:32.400 --> 05:33.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah

05:33.120 --> 05:34.720
Maybe something to do with one of your court cases

05:35.440 --> 05:39.680
It's possible, but also he was going there to do a podcast

05:39.680 --> 05:42.240
He went on that Flagrant 2 podcast

05:42.240 --> 05:45.360
Oh, yeah, when he was drunk last time

05:45.360 --> 05:46.720
He said all the weird stuff

05:46.720 --> 05:50.960
Well, yeah, he was so drunk last time that I don't even care to cover it

05:50.960 --> 05:51.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah

05:52.480 --> 05:54.160
And so, like, he went there

05:54.160 --> 05:56.880
You could think that maybe he's going there for some legal issue

05:56.880 --> 05:58.800
But then also maybe he's just doing this podcast

05:58.800 --> 05:59.600
Yeah, sure

05:59.600 --> 06:01.600
And so that was a possibility

06:01.600 --> 06:03.040
Maybe we cover that episode

06:03.040 --> 06:03.680
Sure

06:03.680 --> 06:08.880
Simultaneously, Kill Tony, the podcast, had Alex as a guest

06:08.880 --> 06:09.840
Ugh

06:09.840 --> 06:13.760
Tony Hinchcliffe, noted Asian slur purveyor

06:13.760 --> 06:18.480
Yeah, hasn't anybody taken that towards his career?

06:18.480 --> 06:19.200
Yes, actually

06:19.200 --> 06:20.000
Let's kill Tony's career

06:20.000 --> 06:20.720
Can we do that?

06:20.720 --> 06:21.200
Well, I mean

06:21.200 --> 06:22.160
That's my new podcast

06:22.160 --> 06:23.520
He did get dropped by his agent

06:23.520 --> 06:25.200
Well, that's good, we're on our way

06:26.560 --> 06:29.040
So we've at least maimed Tony's career

06:29.040 --> 06:30.640
Yeah, I mean, I don't think it'll matter

06:30.640 --> 06:37.280
Because the cult of Rogan Enterprises has him ensconced under their umbrella

06:37.280 --> 06:43.120
But yeah, so Tony Hinchcliffe is a writer, guy, and comedian

06:43.120 --> 06:45.920
Who he formerly wrote for the WWE and such

06:45.920 --> 06:47.920
And he's one of Rogan's buddies

06:47.920 --> 06:51.040
And he's one of the ones who decided to go to Austin

06:51.040 --> 06:54.400
Because their bread is buttered in a very specific place

06:54.400 --> 06:57.200
Yeah, yeah, there's no reason to be in LA anymore

06:57.200 --> 06:58.400
People don't like me there

06:58.400 --> 06:58.900
No!

06:59.680 --> 07:00.180
Bye!

07:00.640 --> 07:02.080
Texas is where I'm welcome

07:02.080 --> 07:04.160
My career revolves around Joe Rogan

07:04.160 --> 07:05.840
Joe Rogan's going to Texas

07:05.840 --> 07:07.280
I am too

07:07.280 --> 07:08.720
That's so sad

07:08.720 --> 07:09.280
No, it's not

07:09.840 --> 07:13.040
I think it's people understanding where their cottage industry is

07:13.040 --> 07:14.000
Oh no, totally

07:14.000 --> 07:17.920
I'm talking about the specifics of my career revolves around Joe Rogan

07:17.920 --> 07:18.720
He can do worse

07:18.720 --> 07:19.920
Yeah, that's true

07:19.920 --> 07:23.280
So Kill Tony is a podcast that he does

07:23.280 --> 07:28.000
That grew out of this open mic at the Comedy Store

07:28.000 --> 07:30.160
I believe it was called Potluck Night or something

07:30.160 --> 07:31.280
Something like that, yeah

07:31.280 --> 07:32.240
And so like they just

07:32.240 --> 07:35.520
I guess they just decided like let's find a way to monetize this

07:35.520 --> 07:39.360
And so they monetized an open mic

07:39.360 --> 07:40.080
Not terrible

07:40.080 --> 07:40.580
Yeah

07:41.200 --> 07:43.520
Of the business decisions for an open mic

07:43.520 --> 07:45.440
That one's probably the best I've ever heard

07:45.440 --> 07:46.160
Sure

07:46.160 --> 07:48.800
I've listened to a number of episodes of it

07:48.800 --> 07:51.600
Because there was a morbid curiosity on my part

07:51.600 --> 07:53.920
And like back, you know, a ways back

07:53.920 --> 07:55.200
Not just just recently

07:55.200 --> 07:58.960
But you know the show is basically you've got Tony

07:58.960 --> 08:01.600
You got his producer Brian Redban

08:01.600 --> 08:03.200
And then you got a guest

08:03.200 --> 08:05.360
A celebrity comedian guest

08:05.360 --> 08:07.520
And they just act like hot shit while

08:07.520 --> 08:08.400
Yeah, they just talk shit

08:08.400 --> 08:11.120
A comic does a minute of material

08:11.120 --> 08:13.920
Which is impossible to tell

08:13.920 --> 08:15.600
No, no, no, that's all you need

08:15.600 --> 08:16.720
That's all you need

08:16.720 --> 08:19.840
That's all you need to know if you've got it

08:19.840 --> 08:23.840
Yeah, and then the guests and the hosts will fuck around and act cool

08:23.840 --> 08:28.720
And generally be overly encouraging of some things

08:28.720 --> 08:32.640
And overly mean to anybody who doesn't fit into their like their box

08:32.640 --> 08:33.200
Yeah

08:33.200 --> 08:34.400
And it's just dumb

08:34.400 --> 08:37.680
And I wanted to cover it kind of

08:37.680 --> 08:40.960
Because I felt like, all right, this could be fun

08:41.520 --> 08:43.360
This could be a fun thing to do an episode about

08:44.160 --> 08:49.200
But so much of the episode is like about other people's stand-up sets

08:49.200 --> 08:49.760
Sure

08:49.760 --> 08:51.200
And open mic stand-up sets

08:51.200 --> 08:52.320
And I don't want to cover that

08:52.320 --> 08:53.600
And Alex was the guest

08:53.600 --> 08:54.800
He wasn't due in a minute

08:55.440 --> 08:56.000
Yes

08:56.000 --> 08:58.240
He was the guest judge

08:58.240 --> 08:58.640
Okay

08:59.760 --> 09:01.920
And so like I guess I have this drop

09:01.920 --> 09:04.080
How about some of that Joe Rogan weed?

09:04.080 --> 09:04.880
So there's that

09:04.880 --> 09:06.240
Okay, all right

09:06.240 --> 09:07.680
I guess I have this drop

09:07.680 --> 09:08.320
Once a year?

09:09.440 --> 09:10.960
Yeah, I have this drop

09:11.600 --> 09:13.520
You have a beautiful vagina

09:13.520 --> 09:14.800
Have a nice night

09:14.800 --> 09:16.400
I guess we got that out of it

09:16.400 --> 09:16.960
Great

09:16.960 --> 09:21.520
There's a part where Alex smells some girl's feet who's in the audience

09:21.520 --> 09:21.840
Cool

09:21.840 --> 09:26.000
They call her up on stage because one of the open micers has a foot fetish

09:26.000 --> 09:28.400
And then they get somebody with a foot to smell

09:28.400 --> 09:30.480
And I don't know

09:30.480 --> 09:30.880
Great

09:30.880 --> 09:31.920
Yeah, that's not an episode

09:31.920 --> 09:32.960
Great, great

09:32.960 --> 09:35.840
I'm loving every part of this right up my alley

09:36.400 --> 09:40.560
I'm sure Alex had some insightful criticisms for the comedians

09:41.920 --> 09:44.960
There's one guy who had some dumb jokes

09:44.960 --> 09:48.880
And Alex is like, I'm drunk but that was a very cerebral set

09:52.000 --> 09:52.320
Okay

09:52.960 --> 09:53.840
I enjoyed that

09:53.840 --> 09:55.760
There is some insightful criticisms there

09:55.760 --> 09:56.240
Yeah

09:56.240 --> 09:59.840
I think actually surprisingly at least at the beginning

09:59.840 --> 10:04.000
He was a little bit more thoughtful than Tony

10:04.000 --> 10:04.960
Yeah, well

10:04.960 --> 10:06.160
Or Red Band

10:06.160 --> 10:09.040
Yeah, well, familiarity breeds contempt if you will

10:09.040 --> 10:15.280
It's very difficult for me because, you know, critiquing some of this stuff within the comedy space

10:15.280 --> 10:18.400
Is always going to be walking in molasses

10:18.400 --> 10:19.040
Sure

10:19.040 --> 10:19.920
There's not like

10:22.160 --> 10:25.040
People will just hide behind the like, it's comedy, I'm just joking

10:25.040 --> 10:25.680
Right, right

10:25.680 --> 10:26.560
Whatever stuff

10:26.560 --> 10:30.720
And I don't know, I was listening to the Kill Tony

10:30.720 --> 10:34.160
And I thought like, I have a lot of complaints about this

10:34.720 --> 10:35.440
But who cares

10:36.080 --> 10:43.360
Yeah, I kind of feel like maybe listening and criticizing a podcast

10:43.360 --> 10:46.480
That's about listening and criticizing comedians

10:46.480 --> 10:48.560
Open mic comedians

10:48.560 --> 10:50.720
Is just a waste of everyone's time

10:50.720 --> 10:56.720
Yeah, it felt like challenging, nay, impossible

10:57.840 --> 11:00.080
To make worth listening to

11:00.080 --> 11:00.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah

11:01.360 --> 11:06.400
And so I was like, well, maybe we'll do a little bit about that episode of Flagrant 2

11:06.400 --> 11:06.720
Sure

11:06.720 --> 11:07.600
You know, why not?

11:07.600 --> 11:10.480
This is a little bit longer, this is a conversational piece

11:10.480 --> 11:12.320
Yeah, I want to know what their feet smell like

11:12.320 --> 11:16.240
Alex was so drunk on the first time that I just didn't want to cover it

11:16.240 --> 11:20.480
This time he's a little bit better, but I couldn't handle listening to it

11:20.480 --> 11:22.000
It's so annoying

11:22.000 --> 11:27.520
And look, I think that the hosts actually make a couple of pretty decent jokes

11:27.520 --> 11:28.160
Oh, okay

11:28.160 --> 11:32.960
Like, I can see a little bit of why, if that's what you like, that's fine

11:32.960 --> 11:33.360
Okay

11:33.360 --> 11:37.280
If you like broey, edgy comedy

11:37.280 --> 11:37.600
Sure

11:37.600 --> 11:38.240
Or whatever

11:38.240 --> 11:38.880
Sure, sure, sure

11:38.880 --> 11:44.480
Chat where people are talking about, hey, I had a threesome last week or whatever

11:44.480 --> 11:45.520
Ooh, what a

11:45.520 --> 11:49.920
If you enjoy that, then I can see, you know, this being up your alley

11:49.920 --> 11:50.240
Sure

11:50.240 --> 11:52.160
It was insufferable for my purposes

11:52.160 --> 11:52.560
Hmm

11:52.560 --> 11:55.920
Alex takes his shirt off at one point early

11:55.920 --> 11:56.480
Oh boy

11:56.480 --> 11:56.960
Early

11:57.520 --> 11:58.000
Early

11:58.000 --> 11:58.960
And one of the hosts

11:58.960 --> 12:02.160
What is he, did he see Burt Kreischer on Kill Tony?

12:02.160 --> 12:02.720
Get this

12:02.720 --> 12:03.120
What?

12:03.120 --> 12:05.200
One of the hosts calls him Burt Kreischer

12:05.200 --> 12:06.320
Okay, well there we go

12:06.320 --> 12:11.200
And then the other host makes the joke, did you say Burt crisis actor?

12:12.160 --> 12:13.120
Which is not bad

12:13.760 --> 12:14.080
Boo

12:15.840 --> 12:19.200
See, it's not bad wordplay, it's not bad wordplay

12:19.200 --> 12:20.800
I understand the wordplay

12:20.800 --> 12:22.000
I understand the wordplay

12:22.000 --> 12:25.840
But see, it's funny because Alex ruined a bunch of people's lives

12:25.840 --> 12:29.200
See, these guys are just jokes, they're making jokes to Alex

12:29.200 --> 12:30.560
Right, right, right, right

12:30.560 --> 12:34.560
Not critiquing him about how he ruined a bunch of people's lives by calling them crisis actors

12:34.560 --> 12:35.520
No, it's hilarious

12:35.520 --> 12:36.480
Yeah, it's funny

12:36.480 --> 12:41.760
No, whenever you leave a wake of misery and destruction, what you should do with that is like

12:41.760 --> 12:44.080
make it a funny little bit that you can pun off of

12:44.080 --> 12:44.720
Yeah, it's hilarious

12:44.720 --> 12:48.000
Yeah, everybody will be like, holy shit, I can't believe he pulled it off

12:48.000 --> 12:48.400
Yeah

12:48.400 --> 12:48.640
Yeah

12:48.640 --> 12:51.840
So I mean like, look, it's obviously only funny because

12:51.840 --> 12:55.360
you're talking about something monstrous that the person next to you did

12:55.360 --> 12:56.720
Right, right, right, right

12:56.720 --> 12:58.640
But that said, fine wordplay

12:59.600 --> 13:01.920
Anyway, I really struggle

13:01.920 --> 13:05.280
More like Iraq bored George W. Bush

13:05.280 --> 13:06.960
All right, let's all have a fun time

13:06.960 --> 13:11.200
See, that's a fun joke to make in a friendly conversation with George W. Bush

13:11.200 --> 13:13.200
Yes, exactly, very funny

13:13.200 --> 13:15.760
Yeah, oh man, that genocide

13:15.760 --> 13:20.880
You are, whoo, let me see, your pictures are dumb, hahaha, all right

13:20.880 --> 13:24.640
So we have a couple things that I'm going to talk about towards the end of the episode

13:24.640 --> 13:29.920
from the Flagrant podcast because I think there were even, you know, like as much as it's just

13:29.920 --> 13:34.480
like, ah, these guys are just bullshitting and having fun and whatever, I don't care

13:35.200 --> 13:36.320
I don't care

13:36.320 --> 13:36.560
Yeah

13:36.560 --> 13:42.400
But there are a couple of salient points that I think could be brought up and, you know,

13:42.400 --> 13:44.080
whatever, we'll talk about that at the end of the episode

13:44.080 --> 13:44.720
Gotcha

13:44.720 --> 13:51.120
Thankfully, something happened that's breaking news and Alex had to weigh in on it

13:51.120 --> 13:52.880
And so that's what we'll be talking about today

13:52.880 --> 13:56.960
A special report that Alex put out last night as we're recording this

13:57.520 --> 13:58.720
Wednesday evening

13:58.720 --> 13:59.120
All right

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
So this is a last minute

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
Is it an emergency report on something that was reported roughly a year ago

14:06.000 --> 14:07.520
that we're finally talking about now?

14:07.520 --> 14:09.200
No, no, no, this is actually breaking news

14:09.200 --> 14:10.320
You know what we're going to talk about

14:10.320 --> 14:11.760
Well, yeah, obviously

14:11.760 --> 14:15.440
Anyway, we're going to get to this, but before we do, let's say hello to some new wonks

14:15.440 --> 14:16.320
Oh, that's a good idea

14:16.320 --> 14:20.480
So first, Chavez, why Chavez? Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

14:20.480 --> 14:21.520
I'm a policy wonk

14:21.520 --> 14:23.120
Thank you, Chavez, why?

14:23.120 --> 14:27.120
Thank you, next, Alex in Blunderland, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

14:27.120 --> 14:28.240
I'm a policy wonk

14:28.240 --> 14:30.240
Thank you, Alex in Blunderland

14:30.240 --> 14:32.320
Next, Chris, and then there's an alias here

14:32.320 --> 14:36.080
Jordan's Laughter is Sweet Sweet Music, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

14:36.080 --> 14:37.600
I'm a policy wonk

14:37.600 --> 14:38.320
Thanks, Chris

14:39.040 --> 14:41.440
Next, Dimer, this is Paul, give Dan some money

14:41.440 --> 14:43.440
Thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk

14:43.440 --> 14:44.960
I'm a policy wonk

14:44.960 --> 14:46.080
I don't endorse that message

14:46.080 --> 14:48.000
Okay, Dimer, this is Paul

14:48.720 --> 14:49.440
Okay

14:49.440 --> 14:51.920
And then, look, Technocrat, shout out going out to...

14:52.960 --> 14:56.400
I don't know how to say this, maybe Dicobros?

14:56.400 --> 14:59.120
D-I-E-C-O-B-R-O-S

14:59.120 --> 15:00.880
Okay, Andrew Dice Bros

15:00.880 --> 15:01.600
Ooh, yeah

15:01.600 --> 15:02.880
You're now a technocrat

15:02.880 --> 15:04.160
I'm a policy wonk

15:04.160 --> 15:07.200
Crikey, mate, that's fantastic, have yourself a brew

15:07.200 --> 15:08.640
How's your 401k doing, bro?

15:08.640 --> 15:11.440
All right, we gotta go full tilt boogie on this, Watson, all right?

15:11.440 --> 15:12.720
Let's just get down to business

15:12.720 --> 15:14.800
We ain't making that money off that heroin

15:14.800 --> 15:16.160
Why are you pimps so good?

15:16.800 --> 15:18.480
My neck is freakishly large

15:18.480 --> 15:21.040
I declare info war on you

15:21.040 --> 15:22.080
Thank you so much

15:22.080 --> 15:23.840
Yes, thank you very much

15:23.840 --> 15:24.720
Now, Jordan

15:24.720 --> 15:25.440
Yes, sir

15:25.440 --> 15:26.960
We have to get contemplative

15:26.960 --> 15:27.360
Okay

15:27.360 --> 15:29.840
Giving someone life is giving someone death

15:32.480 --> 15:33.280
You could say that...

15:36.720 --> 15:37.680
Life is death

15:37.680 --> 15:39.040
You could

15:39.040 --> 15:42.000
So first, Fiona got a birthday this week

15:42.000 --> 15:43.200
So happy birthday, Fiona

15:43.200 --> 15:44.400
Happy birthday, Fiona

15:44.960 --> 15:48.240
Laura and Lisa reached out and wanted to wish Ron a happy birthday

15:48.240 --> 15:49.360
So happy birthday, Ronnie

15:49.360 --> 15:50.640
Happy birthday, Ron

15:50.640 --> 15:50.880
Yeah

15:52.400 --> 15:54.080
Cooper got a birthday coming up

15:54.080 --> 15:55.360
Jillian says happy birthday

15:55.360 --> 15:56.400
Happy birthday, Coops

15:56.400 --> 16:00.800
Also would like to wish a happy 21st anniversary to Heather and Phillip

16:00.800 --> 16:02.720
Also known as Captain Awesome

16:02.720 --> 16:05.840
Okay, together they're known as Captain Awesome?

16:05.840 --> 16:07.920
Probably Mizra and Miz Awesome

16:07.920 --> 16:09.360
Okay, all right, well that's good

16:09.920 --> 16:11.040
Also, I checked into this

16:11.760 --> 16:15.440
You know, the Hallmark recommends yearly anniversary gift

16:15.440 --> 16:16.000
Sure, sure

16:16.000 --> 16:17.440
They got the paper anniversary

16:17.440 --> 16:18.400
That's first anniversary

16:18.400 --> 16:19.280
Right, right, right

16:19.280 --> 16:20.800
What do you think the 21st is?

16:20.800 --> 16:23.200
Because I checked into this just to be sure

16:23.200 --> 16:25.680
Is it like brass or something?

16:25.680 --> 16:27.200
Is it one of those?

16:27.200 --> 16:29.920
It's brass, but it's specifically like a tuba

16:29.920 --> 16:33.360
It's like that kind of brass

16:33.360 --> 16:36.960
Hallmark recommends a 21st tuba anniversary

16:36.960 --> 16:37.360
Gotcha

16:37.360 --> 16:39.120
34th anniversary is woodwind

16:39.120 --> 16:41.360
Yes, of course, naturally, yes

16:41.360 --> 16:45.360
No, it's a themed gift surrounding the idea of fire

16:46.320 --> 16:48.800
So that's an interesting

16:48.800 --> 16:52.400
All right, so let's go with

16:52.400 --> 16:56.320
I mean, I have a tattoo of a fire bender's symbol

16:56.320 --> 16:57.440
So we've got that

16:57.440 --> 16:59.840
You can get yourself some fire bending tattoos

16:59.840 --> 17:00.160
Sure

17:00.160 --> 17:01.280
I think that's a great idea

17:01.280 --> 17:04.320
Talk to Zuko, get that out

17:04.320 --> 17:05.200
You know what I'm saying?

17:05.200 --> 17:05.600
Sure

17:05.600 --> 17:07.360
Yeah, fire-based gifts

17:07.360 --> 17:08.640
Light your house on fire

17:08.640 --> 17:10.560
Yep, and finally

17:11.680 --> 17:13.360
Black Dragon Queen Christy

17:13.360 --> 17:14.320
Oh!

17:14.320 --> 17:16.160
Our old friend Christy

17:16.880 --> 17:18.000
Happy birthday coming up

17:18.000 --> 17:18.720
Happy birthday

17:18.720 --> 17:19.440
This weekend

17:20.320 --> 17:22.240
And also end of last month

17:22.880 --> 17:24.320
End of May

17:25.200 --> 17:29.120
Christy and her husband Monty celebrated their 30th anniversary

17:29.120 --> 17:30.080
No shit!

17:30.080 --> 17:30.720
What?

17:30.720 --> 17:31.920
What in God's name?

17:31.920 --> 17:34.080
Do you get like a pair of timpani for that?

17:34.080 --> 17:38.160
What kind of, are we just doing orchestral anniversaries at this point?

17:38.160 --> 17:41.440
30th anniversary is office or desk decor

17:42.560 --> 17:43.120
That's a lie

17:43.120 --> 17:45.520
That's actually the 41st anniversary

17:45.520 --> 17:46.640
The 41st

17:46.640 --> 17:52.320
So you're telling me that I'm somewhere at, I mean, conservatively in my 70s

17:52.320 --> 17:52.880
Uh huh

17:52.880 --> 17:55.680
And you're getting me some office equipment?

17:56.400 --> 17:59.920
So even in Hallmark's world, you work till death

17:59.920 --> 18:00.160
Absolutely

18:00.160 --> 18:04.080
There is no retirement, no social security

18:04.080 --> 18:04.240
No

18:04.880 --> 18:05.840
Office equipment

18:05.840 --> 18:08.800
Yes, office equipment on your 41st anniversary

18:09.920 --> 18:13.360
30th is apparently pearls from what this is saying

18:13.360 --> 18:16.960
I would rather have that one, end your marriage at 30

18:16.960 --> 18:18.800
Why would you make it all the way to 41?

18:18.800 --> 18:21.520
You don't need office equipment, 30 years is long enough

18:21.520 --> 18:23.280
You're gonna love 39th anniversary

18:23.280 --> 18:24.240
What's that one?

18:24.240 --> 18:24.720
Laughter

18:24.720 --> 18:28.800
Laughter

18:28.800 --> 18:31.760
Well Dan, every day I celebrate my 39th anniversary

18:31.760 --> 18:32.000
Yeah

18:32.800 --> 18:34.160
Weird, this list is weird

18:34.160 --> 18:35.680
That is a weird list

18:35.680 --> 18:37.280
53rd anniversary

18:37.280 --> 18:38.880
That is, that is the list

18:38.880 --> 18:40.080
53rd, what do you think it is?

18:40.080 --> 18:44.320
You've made it a long time, you're 53 years into a marriage

18:44.320 --> 18:44.800
I feel like

18:44.800 --> 18:48.720
Keep in mind, 40th anniversary is ruby, right?

18:48.720 --> 18:49.600
So, okay

18:49.600 --> 18:50.640
So 53, what is it?

18:50.640 --> 18:53.680
So the decades are precious items

18:53.680 --> 18:54.800
Yes, 50th is gold

18:54.800 --> 18:59.200
And then the intervening years is, is, I guess at random

18:59.200 --> 19:00.480
Nick Maxx

19:00.480 --> 19:02.480
It's a bunch of shit pulled out of a hat

19:02.480 --> 19:02.960
Yeah

19:02.960 --> 19:03.920
I suppose

19:03.920 --> 19:05.680
So what's 53?

19:05.680 --> 19:07.680
50th is gold

19:07.680 --> 19:09.040
60th is diamond

19:09.040 --> 19:10.160
60th is diamond

19:10.160 --> 19:12.560
40th is ruby, what's 53?

19:12.560 --> 19:16.000
53, I gotta go with marine creature

19:16.000 --> 19:16.880
Plastic

19:16.880 --> 19:18.960
Plastic, plastic

19:18.960 --> 19:20.240
Laughter

19:20.240 --> 19:25.840
So you're telling me that I'm at 90 years old and I'm getting saran wrapped for my anniversary?

19:25.840 --> 19:26.480
If you're lucky

19:26.480 --> 19:27.040
All right

19:27.040 --> 19:29.840
If someone's following the Hallmark recommendations

19:29.840 --> 19:30.560
Thanks Hallmark

19:30.560 --> 19:32.160
Anyway, happy anniversary, Christine

19:32.160 --> 19:32.880
Happy birthday

19:33.840 --> 19:37.040
Also, Alex would like to remind everyone that we were born dead

19:37.040 --> 19:37.600
Yes

19:37.600 --> 19:39.360
Life is death

19:39.360 --> 19:40.000
Or something

19:40.000 --> 19:41.040
Or something

19:41.040 --> 19:49.600
So, Jordan, as you know, the big news that was breaking yesterday is that John McAfee is no more

19:49.600 --> 19:50.400
Yes

19:50.400 --> 19:50.720
Or

19:51.840 --> 19:52.480
Is he

19:52.480 --> 19:56.880
He was found deceased in a prison cell in Spain

19:56.880 --> 19:57.440
Sure

19:57.440 --> 20:02.480
He had just gotten word that he would be extradited to the United States

20:02.480 --> 20:04.880
to face some criminal charges

20:04.880 --> 20:09.440
Yeah, I think if I were being extradited from Spanish prison to United States prison,

20:09.440 --> 20:11.280
I'd be like, nah, I'm out

20:11.280 --> 20:15.280
It's, it's hard to say, but it's not if you're Alex

20:15.280 --> 20:20.880
Hmm, John McAfee did not kill himself in public statements and on his own Twitter

20:20.880 --> 20:25.520
As early as just last week, he said, I will never commit suicide if I die in prison

20:25.520 --> 20:28.240
I have been murdered by the US government

20:28.240 --> 20:30.560
I'm going to listen to a man I'm new and respected

20:30.560 --> 20:33.680
Not the lying corporate media that before his body's even cold

20:33.680 --> 20:34.960
You respected?

20:34.960 --> 20:37.920
It's a suicide with no coroner or no inquest

20:37.920 --> 20:40.800
This thing sneaks to high heaven just like Jeffrey Epstein

20:40.800 --> 20:46.640
That's a good, that's a good cold open to his special report that he put out

20:46.640 --> 20:48.400
That's not bad, that's pretty direct

20:48.400 --> 20:53.360
So even if we take as absolute gospel fact that McAfee said he would never kill himself,

20:53.360 --> 20:55.280
he was the definition of an unhinged,

20:55.280 --> 20:59.120
drugged out lunatic who said complete bullshit, essentially for a living

20:59.120 --> 21:03.280
I would never imagine that a man so respected as John McAfee

21:03.280 --> 21:07.280
would perhaps send out a dumb idea very quickly before he thought it through

21:07.280 --> 21:11.120
A couple of my favorite things that he said that were complete nonsense were,

21:11.120 --> 21:15.120
you know, like when he said that he had nothing to do with his neighbor in Belize's murder

21:15.120 --> 21:15.440
No

21:15.440 --> 21:20.480
Or that time that he said that if Bitcoin wasn't trading at $500,000 within three years

21:20.480 --> 21:26.000
from July 17th, 2017, he would quote, eat his own dick on national television

21:26.000 --> 21:26.960
Did he ever do that?

21:26.960 --> 21:27.520
He didn't

21:27.520 --> 21:30.400
Oh, I guess it's too late now

21:30.400 --> 21:34.320
Some of his more recent work includes that time that he tried to create a publicity stunt hoax

21:34.320 --> 21:37.600
where he pretended to have been arrested for refusing to wear a mask,

21:37.600 --> 21:40.080
wearing a lace thong on his face instead

21:40.080 --> 21:41.040
Ah, he's brilliant

21:41.040 --> 21:44.000
McAfee and his wife publicly claimed he'd been arrested in Norway,

21:44.000 --> 21:47.840
but the pictures that they posted as evidence of this were from the Augsburg airport,

21:47.840 --> 21:49.280
which is in Germany

21:49.280 --> 21:51.280
The Augsburg police told the media, quote,

21:51.280 --> 21:55.040
there has never been an arrest, explaining that McAfee tried to enter Germany,

21:55.040 --> 21:58.000
but decided not to when he was told that he would have to quarantine

21:58.000 --> 22:00.240
Then he just created a bunch of bullshit on social media

22:00.240 --> 22:00.960
Right, right, right

22:00.960 --> 22:05.840
And who could forget the ridiculous runs for the libertarian nomination for the presidential race

22:05.840 --> 22:11.200
or the very overt and transparent history of involvement in pump and dump cryptocurrency scams

22:11.200 --> 22:11.840
Sure

22:11.840 --> 22:15.600
In fact, that was one of the cases that McAfee was facing, along with tax evasion,

22:15.600 --> 22:20.800
which is what the US was looking to extradite him back from Spain in order to prosecute him for

22:21.520 --> 22:22.720
Soon before he was found dead,

22:22.720 --> 22:27.680
a court ruled that he could be extradited to the United States, and this actually really matters

22:27.680 --> 22:32.000
McAfee was 75 years old, and he was facing essentially the rest of his life in prison

22:32.000 --> 22:36.640
for his fraud and tax crimes, which he absolutely would be convicted for

22:36.640 --> 22:37.120
Yeah

22:37.120 --> 22:40.720
Since there's video that he released of himself where he confesses,

22:40.720 --> 22:42.480
which might be tough to refute

22:42.480 --> 22:43.040
Let's hear it

22:43.040 --> 22:46.080
I have not paid taxes for eight years, I've made no secret of it

22:46.080 --> 22:47.840
I have not filed returns

22:47.840 --> 22:52.400
Every year I tell the IRS I'm not filing a return, I have no intention of doing so

22:52.400 --> 22:53.600
Come and find me

22:53.600 --> 22:54.960
Yeah, that's gonna be tough

22:55.760 --> 22:57.360
You know what bums me out?

22:57.360 --> 23:03.840
What bums me out so much is that we know for a fact that if you are rich,

23:03.840 --> 23:06.880
you literally can get away with not paying taxes

23:08.320 --> 23:09.040
You know what I'm saying?

23:09.040 --> 23:12.080
Like, we just got a New York Times report

23:12.080 --> 23:12.640
Sure

23:12.640 --> 23:15.600
About how you don't have to pay taxes if you're rich

23:15.600 --> 23:21.680
And the only way that you can fuck up if you're rich is if you're just an asshole like this

23:21.680 --> 23:22.880
It's the only way!

23:23.600 --> 23:24.640
There's one way!

23:24.640 --> 23:30.160
It's... some people are too defiant, I guess

23:30.160 --> 23:31.520
I'll never pay taxes

23:31.520 --> 23:35.760
Well then use any one of a million loopholes we've created for rich people to not have to do that

23:35.760 --> 23:37.520
It's about the principle of the thing

23:37.520 --> 23:39.920
Then fine, you're gonna die in a Spanish prison

23:39.920 --> 23:40.960
I don't know what to tell you!

23:42.160 --> 23:43.200
This is on you!

23:43.200 --> 23:48.480
It's basically like the ceiling, metaphorically which is taxes, is coming down

23:48.480 --> 23:48.960
Yes

23:48.960 --> 23:51.600
And there's an open door

23:51.600 --> 23:52.560
Yes

23:52.560 --> 23:55.840
And it's like, do you want to go through that door?

23:55.840 --> 23:56.480
It's open

23:56.480 --> 23:57.120
It's open

23:57.120 --> 23:58.320
There's nothing on the other side

23:58.320 --> 23:58.720
Yes

23:58.720 --> 23:59.680
There's no punishments

23:59.680 --> 24:00.480
It's not a trap

24:00.480 --> 24:02.000
You'll just go off your business

24:02.000 --> 24:03.920
This is a loophole for the whole roof thing

24:03.920 --> 24:04.800
The whole thing

24:04.800 --> 24:05.440
I will not

24:06.160 --> 24:08.160
I will be crushed by this roof

24:08.160 --> 24:08.640
Okay

24:08.640 --> 24:09.200
All right, man

24:09.200 --> 24:12.080
I can't say with certainty that McAfee died from suicide

24:12.080 --> 24:17.280
But if that does end up being the determination that experts end up making, I'm not going to be surprised

24:17.280 --> 24:19.920
I wanted to get a sense of how the media was covering this death

24:19.920 --> 24:24.480
So I sampled some of the largest outlets that were covering the story

24:24.480 --> 24:24.960
Mm-hmm

24:24.960 --> 24:26.480
The headline in CNN was

24:26.480 --> 24:31.920
quote, John McAfee found dead in Spanish prison after his extradition to the United States was approved

24:31.920 --> 24:35.280
The article doesn't say that there's a known cause of death at all

24:35.280 --> 24:40.480
quote, McAfee was found dead in his cell in a prison near Barcelona on Wednesday around 1 p.m.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.960
Eastern and a medical examiner is on the scene

24:42.960 --> 24:46.960
A spokeswoman for the Superior Court of Catalonia told CNN

24:46.960 --> 24:49.520
She said the cause of death is under investigation

24:49.520 --> 24:52.800
A statement from the Catalonia Regional Government Justice Department

24:52.800 --> 24:54.400
which manages prisons there

24:54.400 --> 24:58.080
said that prison medical personnel and guards attempted to perform life-saving procedures

24:58.080 --> 25:01.040
after finding McAfee but were unsuccessful

25:01.040 --> 25:01.760
The statement said

25:01.760 --> 25:06.720
quote, everything indicates unquote that McAfee could have died by suicide

25:07.280 --> 25:10.880
That article is eminently responsible and doesn't jump to any conclusions

25:10.880 --> 25:12.160
Wildly so

25:12.160 --> 25:13.520
The BBC headline was

25:13.520 --> 25:17.600
quote, John McAfee anti-virus creator found dead in prison cell

25:17.600 --> 25:22.000
The article also doesn't provide a cause of death but does mention that same press release

25:22.000 --> 25:27.760
quote, the Catalan Justice Department said prison medics tried to resuscitate him but were not successful

25:27.760 --> 25:29.040
It's said in a statement that

25:29.040 --> 25:32.160
quote, everything indicates unquote McAfee took his own life

25:32.160 --> 25:32.800
Right

25:32.800 --> 25:34.480
The New York Times story has a headline

25:34.480 --> 25:39.520
quote, John McAfee software pioneer turned fugitive dies in Spanish prison

25:39.520 --> 25:41.520
They mentioned the primary source statement

25:41.520 --> 25:46.160
quote, the Justice Department for the Catalan region in Spain said that pending an investigation

25:46.160 --> 25:48.720
it was treating his death as a probable suicide

25:49.360 --> 25:53.280
The NPR story doesn't even talk about the Catalonia Justice Department comment

25:53.280 --> 25:54.480
instead just reporting

25:54.480 --> 25:57.200
quote, authorities are investigating the cause of death

25:57.760 --> 26:00.800
This article even goes out of its way to soften McAfee's image

26:00.800 --> 26:03.760
and turn him into some kind of a prankster type outlaw

26:03.760 --> 26:06.640
quote, McAfee took pride in outwitting authorities

26:06.640 --> 26:10.640
He once boasted about eluding police by dressing as a German tourist in a speedo

26:10.640 --> 26:12.560
and another time as an angry homeless man

26:12.560 --> 26:16.480
It's like the NPR version of this is really like

26:16.480 --> 26:17.760
I mean these things are true

26:17.760 --> 26:18.720
McAfee did do

26:18.720 --> 26:19.680
Sure, sure

26:19.680 --> 26:22.960
He did enjoy creating this outlaw

26:22.960 --> 26:23.680
Right, right

26:23.680 --> 26:25.520
On the run image of himself

26:25.520 --> 26:25.840
Yeah

26:25.840 --> 26:27.200
Outsmarting the police

26:27.200 --> 26:27.920
Right

26:27.920 --> 26:31.600
And you know, it's not wrong for NPR to report that

26:31.600 --> 26:34.480
but that seems to be the angle that they're taking more

26:34.480 --> 26:39.280
Yeah, I would have included more of his bombastic psychotic criminal acts

26:39.280 --> 26:45.440
but I suppose if you want to paint him as a modern day world traveling

26:46.560 --> 26:48.800
catch me if you can type con artist

26:48.800 --> 26:49.120
Yeah

26:49.120 --> 26:49.600
Fine

26:49.600 --> 26:50.240
Yeah

26:50.240 --> 26:51.760
Reuters had this headline

26:51.760 --> 26:57.440
quote, larger than life software mogul John McAfee dies in Spain by suicide, lawyer says

26:58.080 --> 27:00.720
This is because this story isn't about the actual death

27:00.720 --> 27:05.120
It's about McAfee's lawyer making a statement that McAfee died by suicide

27:05.120 --> 27:11.520
quote, McAfee's lawyer Javier Villalba said the anti-virus software pioneer died by hanging

27:11.520 --> 27:14.000
as his nine months in prison brought him to despair

27:14.640 --> 27:17.200
Even so, even though this article is saying this

27:17.200 --> 27:20.880
the article does not say that this in fact was the cause of death

27:20.880 --> 27:23.600
only that McAfee's lawyer had said that it was

27:24.400 --> 27:26.480
None of these outlets are reporting anything definitive

27:26.480 --> 27:30.640
and the information that they have to go on is directly from primary source statements

27:30.640 --> 27:34.880
one from the Catalonia Justice Department and one from McAfee's own lawyer

27:34.880 --> 27:37.040
This is responsible reporting of the facts

27:37.040 --> 27:41.920
I can't find examples of these folks rushing and jumping the gun to call this a suicide

27:41.920 --> 27:49.040
No, I can hear every editor of every major outlet screaming we're not doing an Epstein this time

27:49.040 --> 27:53.120
All right, no fuck-ups, no Epstein conspiracy theories

27:53.120 --> 27:57.440
But here's why this looking at the coverage is important

27:57.440 --> 28:02.320
Alex is trying to rush and jump the gun on the conclusion that his death was not a suicide

28:02.320 --> 28:06.080
and in order to do that he needs to make the circumstances around the coverage

28:06.720 --> 28:10.720
seem as suspicious as possible Alex is reporting a fiction

28:10.720 --> 28:15.440
which is that the media is immediately and without cause declaring McAfee's death a suicide

28:15.440 --> 28:17.680
because they're trying to cover something up

28:17.680 --> 28:22.320
because that kernel of suspicion is necessary for Alex to use this story for his own purposes

28:23.120 --> 28:28.480
Alex is an opportunist by nature and he needs to use everything he can for his largest benefit

28:28.480 --> 28:33.200
Just last week Alex was covering that reporter Christopher Sein's death as a definitive

28:33.200 --> 28:36.080
professional execution and his big prediction was

28:36.080 --> 28:39.280
the globalists are going to start killing people like himself and Tucker

28:39.280 --> 28:41.840
This situation with McAfee isn't a perfect fit

28:41.840 --> 28:44.880
but it's good enough for Alex to use to claim that he was right

28:44.880 --> 28:49.120
so this absolutely cannot be a suicide in Infowars world

28:49.120 --> 28:54.240
Yeah, it's almost like it really doesn't matter how responsible the reporting of mainstream outlets is

28:54.240 --> 28:56.960
Alex is just going to make it up on his own regardless

28:56.960 --> 28:58.080
Yeah, absolutely

28:58.080 --> 29:02.560
There's a real danger to this kind of behavior and it's in how Alex's rhetoric has been shaped

29:02.560 --> 29:06.240
over the course of the past year and even further back honestly

29:06.240 --> 29:11.520
The COVID pandemic has been declared the globalists big move and something that they can't undo

29:11.520 --> 29:15.920
This is the end game coming into reality which means that there's no going back

29:15.920 --> 29:19.520
Alex has said that over and over in so many different constructions

29:19.520 --> 29:22.960
Victory or death, no going back, they've crossed the Rubicon

29:22.960 --> 29:27.440
over and over and over again in different ways saying there's no going home again

29:27.440 --> 29:33.600
Also, I'm very very sorry Hamdi, it's on me, I apologize, I know I said I would die on that hill

29:33.600 --> 29:35.280
but listen, my bad

29:35.280 --> 29:40.160
The rhetoric surrounding how this is like the end game and you know this is the big move

29:40.160 --> 29:42.400
That's dangerous enough on its own

29:42.400 --> 29:47.040
and if Alex is now going to start reporting stuff like people like McAfee dying as the

29:47.040 --> 29:49.840
globalists killing off brave patriot leaders

29:49.840 --> 29:53.360
What's the logical leap he's expecting his audience to make?

29:53.360 --> 29:57.360
He constantly talks about how everyone needs to keep lists of globalists in their town

29:57.360 --> 30:00.000
and be ready to take them out when things jump off

30:00.000 --> 30:02.160
How is killing off patriot leaders

30:02.160 --> 30:06.240
not the most explicit evidence that things have jumped off that you could imagine?

30:06.240 --> 30:06.880
Yeah

30:06.880 --> 30:09.600
Whether he means to do this or not is kind of irrelevant

30:09.600 --> 30:12.880
It's just part of the message that his audience is going to take from that

30:12.880 --> 30:17.280
As far as I can tell all we can really do is hope that the people who get that message

30:17.280 --> 30:20.080
aren't the type of listeners that he has who like to take action

30:20.080 --> 30:22.400
Yeah because the only message you can get is

30:22.400 --> 30:25.760
once they're done with all of these people they're coming for you

30:25.760 --> 30:26.240
Right

30:26.240 --> 30:30.080
So you might as well stop them now before they come for you

30:30.080 --> 30:36.400
Yeah and talking about like Epstein as a murder, a Hillary murder or whatever

30:36.400 --> 30:38.960
is a little bit different even because that's like

30:38.960 --> 30:41.040
all right they're trying to cover up their tracks

30:41.040 --> 30:41.360
Right

30:41.360 --> 30:42.080
Or whatever

30:42.080 --> 30:46.480
It's not a direct assault on the patriot folks

30:46.480 --> 30:46.960
True

30:46.960 --> 30:48.640
These people that Alex respects

30:48.640 --> 30:51.200
Epstein wasn't a patriot that's for sure

30:51.200 --> 30:54.640
He's not like McAfee a libertarian anti-tax weirdo

30:54.640 --> 30:55.520
Right right right

30:55.520 --> 30:57.520
Who actually would go on Infowars

30:57.520 --> 30:58.320
He really would

31:01.360 --> 31:03.120
Is this really gonna move the needle though?

31:03.120 --> 31:07.920
I feel like McAfee is just gonna be a blip and then everybody's gonna be like yeah I'm fine

31:07.920 --> 31:11.200
Alex needed it to justify the previous coverage of his

31:11.200 --> 31:13.200
predictions of patriot leaders being killed

31:13.200 --> 31:15.200
So it's very important for that piece

31:15.200 --> 31:16.800
True he's got to sell it hard

31:16.800 --> 31:20.240
But second I don't think that at this point Alex is aware that

31:20.240 --> 31:24.000
McAfee's Instagram posted a big Q right after he died

31:24.000 --> 31:25.280
Which is gonna complicate

31:25.280 --> 31:26.880
That's gonna make it a little weird

31:26.880 --> 31:28.960
That's gonna make it a little bit dicey

31:28.960 --> 31:34.400
Yeah so Alex talks a little bit about how he got to know McAfee

31:34.960 --> 31:40.640
I got a chance to get to know McAfee back in 2012 right after his escape

31:40.640 --> 31:46.640
from Belize into Guatemala and found to be a larger than life type character

31:46.640 --> 31:50.800
Then a few years later he came and visited us several times in Austin Texas

31:50.800 --> 31:52.480
I had a chance to go to dinner with him

31:52.480 --> 31:54.320
Had a chance to go out shooting with him

31:54.320 --> 31:56.880
And he was even more larger than life in person

31:56.880 --> 32:00.320
The guy was definitely an American success story

32:00.320 --> 32:03.680
He made billions of dollars with his McAfee anti-virus software

32:03.680 --> 32:06.240
So in terms of being an American success story

32:06.800 --> 32:08.240
McAfee was born in England

32:08.880 --> 32:12.640
And he once told the BBC quote I feel as much British as I do American

32:12.640 --> 32:13.360
Well

32:13.360 --> 32:17.200
He founded McAfee Associates but he also sold that in 1994

32:17.200 --> 32:20.800
And since then it's not what I would call a glowing success story

32:20.800 --> 32:23.440
You know more like a cautionary tale

32:24.560 --> 32:28.480
Or just perhaps an evil motherfucker wandering around

32:28.480 --> 32:29.760
Upsetting weirdo

32:29.760 --> 32:31.280
Yeah that's a good way of putting it

32:31.280 --> 32:32.320
I'll take that one

32:32.320 --> 32:34.080
Um so Alex has a comparison

32:34.080 --> 32:36.400
A historical comparison that he makes

32:36.400 --> 32:38.960
That what a shock it has to do with booze

32:39.760 --> 32:40.480
Larger than life

32:40.480 --> 32:42.400
I would compare the guy to like Captain Morgan

32:42.400 --> 32:44.080
He's seen on the side of the rum bottles

32:44.080 --> 32:46.080
I think the pirate

32:46.080 --> 32:49.200
And he certainly tried to go retire down in Belize and live like a pirate

32:49.200 --> 32:50.080
Hmm

32:50.080 --> 32:52.720
Captain Henry Morgan was a big old pile of shit

32:52.720 --> 32:54.720
I don't know if this is the person you'd want to be compared to

32:55.520 --> 32:57.840
In his later career he was employed by Jamaica

32:57.840 --> 33:01.840
To keep privateers and pirates away from the area surrounding the island

33:01.840 --> 33:04.080
They used to call him the Jamoca from Jamaica

33:06.080 --> 33:07.040
Instead

33:07.040 --> 33:10.560
You're gonna compliment the two flagrant two ones?

33:10.560 --> 33:11.440
But what's Jamoca?

33:12.160 --> 33:12.640
Jamoke

33:13.440 --> 33:14.000
Never mind

33:15.280 --> 33:16.000
Okay

33:16.000 --> 33:19.520
Instead what he did is he decided to just demand money from pirates

33:19.520 --> 33:21.840
To allow them to come on to land

33:21.840 --> 33:22.080
Sure

33:22.080 --> 33:24.000
So he just basically was like you got to pay me

33:24.000 --> 33:25.600
Yeah he was running a protection racket

33:25.600 --> 33:26.560
Basically yeah

33:26.560 --> 33:30.320
He was an outrageous drunk and he declared martial law twice in a two-year span

33:30.320 --> 33:32.880
Because of fears of a French invasion

33:32.880 --> 33:37.120
Which it should be pointed out he was accused of collaborating with the French

33:37.120 --> 33:37.920
Well

33:37.920 --> 33:41.600
After all that until his death Morgan owned three slave plantations

33:41.600 --> 33:45.280
And spent a whole bunch of his time trying to enslave more black Jamaicans

33:45.280 --> 33:45.920
He sucked

33:45.920 --> 33:51.360
Yeah yeah but uh you know now we venerate him for his booze I guess

33:51.360 --> 33:51.600
Yeah

33:51.600 --> 33:52.160
That's good

33:52.160 --> 33:56.000
I would imagine that Alex knows him as a pirate on a bottle of rum

33:56.000 --> 34:00.320
Yeah I very much doubt the true story of Captain Morgan is high on anybody's list

34:00.320 --> 34:05.360
Although I would guess that if Alex knew some of these things he'd be like even more into him

34:05.360 --> 34:06.880
That's pretty cool man

34:06.880 --> 34:12.960
I would like to run my own island fortress and collaborate with the French to overthrow my own fucking home

34:12.960 --> 34:13.760
Allegedly

34:13.760 --> 34:14.080
Yes

34:14.080 --> 34:14.720
It's unclear

34:14.720 --> 34:15.600
Okay that's fair

34:15.600 --> 34:17.280
So um Alex

34:17.280 --> 34:18.720
I would hate to tarnish his name

34:18.720 --> 34:21.840
Alex's big piece of evidence that he has really to go on

34:22.640 --> 34:26.560
About McAfee and how this could not possibly this has got to be a murder

34:26.560 --> 34:30.320
It's the one time he tweeted out that I would never commit suicide and if I die in a prison

34:30.320 --> 34:32.160
It's because the United States government murdered me

34:32.160 --> 34:33.440
Yeah yeah it's tweets

34:33.440 --> 34:34.080
Okay

34:34.080 --> 34:38.960
Now he's dead and all we have is his last communications this year and last year

34:38.960 --> 34:41.520
And the year before saying he would never commit suicide

34:41.520 --> 34:45.200
Here's another one from October of last year 2020

34:45.200 --> 34:46.800
I am content here

34:46.800 --> 34:49.600
I have friends the food is good all is well

34:49.600 --> 34:51.600
This is in the Barcelona prison

34:51.600 --> 34:57.520
Know that if I hang myself a la Epstein it will be no fault of mine

34:57.520 --> 35:04.320
So that's a second time he's saying I will not commit suicide and if I die in prison it's a setup

35:04.320 --> 35:08.400
That's the first instance that I heard in this report of Alex having

35:09.120 --> 35:11.120
I don't know why he's saying this is the second time

35:11.120 --> 35:12.720
I think it's probably an editing screw-up

35:12.720 --> 35:12.960
Yeah

35:12.960 --> 35:13.920
I'm not sure

35:13.920 --> 35:18.080
So this tweet is probably the strongest evidence that Alex has that McAfee didn't kill himself

35:18.080 --> 35:20.800
Since he said he wouldn't do that in October

35:20.800 --> 35:24.960
I accept this as something that makes sense on its face but I also don't think it proves anything

35:25.520 --> 35:29.200
John McAfee was one of the most unhinged unstable people in the public eye

35:29.200 --> 35:33.920
And it isn't necessarily wise to take most of the things he says without a giant grain of salt

35:33.920 --> 35:34.560
Okay

35:34.560 --> 35:38.480
I can believe that in October he may have felt that he would never commit suicide

35:38.480 --> 35:40.240
But that was also eight months ago

35:40.240 --> 35:43.680
And a lot can change to a person's mental state over the course of eight months

35:43.680 --> 35:48.240
Particularly if they're in a foreign prison and maybe without the drugs that they generally do

35:48.240 --> 35:50.240
It could change your mindset

35:50.240 --> 35:54.320
McAfee has had a long history of being arrested in foreign countries

35:54.320 --> 35:58.880
Or being wanted in foreign countries and getting away and going on the run

35:58.880 --> 36:01.440
When he was a person of interest in his neighbor's murder and beliefs

36:01.440 --> 36:03.600
He fled the country and he got away with it

36:03.600 --> 36:08.640
More notably in 2019 he was arrested and released when he docked his boat in the Dominican Republic

36:08.640 --> 36:11.520
He was on the run from the United States for that old tax thing

36:11.520 --> 36:14.640
And he'd taken to living on his yacht I guess in international waters

36:14.640 --> 36:16.640
Like some goddamn Andy Daley character

36:16.640 --> 36:17.840
Yeah that sounds fun

36:17.840 --> 36:18.480
Yeah

36:18.480 --> 36:23.520
To kill time on the boat McAfee posted some pictures of himself with a bunch of big old guns

36:23.520 --> 36:27.120
This drew the attention to the Dominican Republic authorities when he tried to dock

36:27.120 --> 36:30.240
So he was arrested and held for four days and then he was released

36:30.240 --> 36:32.480
You know what I think about going on the run?

36:32.480 --> 36:37.360
If I was running from the law I would try also very hard to not be noticed

36:37.360 --> 36:41.200
Hmm See that would be part of my strategy of like

36:41.200 --> 36:44.720
If I had the opportunity to tweet out something I would be like

36:44.720 --> 36:47.280
Maybe people will notice this Yes

36:47.280 --> 36:48.960
And I don't think I should do that

36:48.960 --> 36:52.640
So you're saying that when you're on the run it's kind of like you're in the no flex zone

36:52.640 --> 36:59.360
You know I might even change my name or at the very least get a new Twitter handle

36:59.360 --> 37:01.360
I would try and get rid of that blue check mark

37:01.360 --> 37:05.520
Yeah I think it doesn't serve your interests of being on the run

37:05.520 --> 37:08.000
To like really publicize a bunch of

37:09.680 --> 37:12.480
I'm living out on this boat with these giant guns

37:13.600 --> 37:15.440
No one will ever catch me

37:15.440 --> 37:17.920
This is impressing my Instagram followers

37:17.920 --> 37:22.240
But might be working across purposes of my trying to be on the run

37:22.240 --> 37:24.800
I think that might be why he got caught so many times

37:24.800 --> 37:25.200
Maybe

37:25.200 --> 37:25.760
Yeah

37:25.760 --> 37:29.680
John McAfee has a history of getting in trouble and then the consequences just disappear

37:29.680 --> 37:32.560
So in October just after he'd been arrested in Spain

37:32.560 --> 37:36.560
If you're him there's no way you think you're going to be in jail for the next eight months

37:36.560 --> 37:39.760
Let alone end up extradited to the United States after that

37:39.760 --> 37:40.160
Totally

37:40.160 --> 37:44.080
Him posting that tweet I can see that kind of as shit posting

37:44.080 --> 37:46.160
I mean it might as well be him saying like

37:46.160 --> 37:47.840
I'll probably find a way to escape in a week

37:48.880 --> 37:50.240
Like that's what he's doing

37:50.240 --> 37:53.040
Until some actual evidence can be presented to the contrary

37:53.040 --> 37:58.400
I see no reason to think that the simplest explanation here is impossible

37:58.400 --> 38:00.960
Like John McAfee's luck had run out

38:00.960 --> 38:05.600
He was going to be returned to the United States and he was likely going to be in prison for years

38:05.600 --> 38:10.640
He was a vagabond, a world traveler, a guy who flees countries and lives on boats

38:10.640 --> 38:15.760
The prospect of long-term incarceration seems like exactly the thing that he would find intolerable

38:15.760 --> 38:16.720
Yeah fuck that

38:16.720 --> 38:19.120
There's a lot of questions that do remain to be answered

38:19.120 --> 38:24.080
But making this a hit team murder I think is going to be a really uphill battle for Alex

38:24.080 --> 38:28.000
Especially if the thing he's leading with is a tweet from eight months ago

38:28.000 --> 38:28.320
Yeah

38:28.960 --> 38:29.920
I don't know

38:29.920 --> 38:34.000
I mean, because then you just get back to like

38:34.000 --> 38:37.840
Really? Why? Why would they send a hit team?

38:38.480 --> 38:38.800
Yeah

38:38.800 --> 38:41.600
What's a hit team? You could be, I mean, you know

38:41.600 --> 38:42.080
Also

38:42.080 --> 38:43.280
Like for McAfee?

38:43.280 --> 38:50.800
Also McAfee has very publicly on Twitter in interviews said that he has a dead man switch

38:50.800 --> 38:51.040
Yeah

38:51.040 --> 38:52.880
So like

38:52.880 --> 38:53.360
Okay

38:53.360 --> 38:54.000
Yeah

38:54.000 --> 38:55.200
Okay fine

38:55.200 --> 39:00.480
Yeah that's like okay anybody who would want to kill him presumably because he has some

39:00.480 --> 39:02.400
kind of information that they want covered up

39:02.400 --> 39:02.800
Yeah

39:02.800 --> 39:03.760
Would be like oh wait

39:03.760 --> 39:05.040
They don't want him to go on trial

39:05.040 --> 39:10.640
Oh wait if he if he ends up getting killed then his wife is just going to release all of these

39:10.640 --> 39:11.040
Sure

39:11.040 --> 39:12.640
Docs or whatever

39:12.640 --> 39:15.840
Yeah it's it's nonsense this is all just a spy novel

39:15.840 --> 39:16.720
Yeah yeah

39:16.720 --> 39:21.920
And it's sad because like ultimately the the story is a tragic one I think

39:21.920 --> 39:26.560
Uh I mean you know to a certain extent you could just describe it as the

39:27.360 --> 39:30.000
quick destruction of one man's mind

39:30.000 --> 39:30.800
I don't know if it was that quick

39:30.800 --> 39:31.600
Consequences

39:31.600 --> 39:32.960
I think it's been long

39:32.960 --> 39:34.480
When you give them a lot of money

39:34.480 --> 39:36.560
I don't think it was quick

39:36.560 --> 39:36.960
Well

39:36.960 --> 39:38.320
This has been going on a while

39:38.320 --> 39:41.120
No I mean his mind was destroyed fairly quickly

39:41.120 --> 39:41.600
Perhaps

39:41.600 --> 39:42.160
Yeah

39:42.160 --> 39:46.320
So uh not only did he tweet once he tweeted another time too

39:46.320 --> 39:50.400
Here's another one that was put out in November of 2019

39:50.400 --> 39:52.720
So a year before the one in 2020

39:52.720 --> 39:53.200
And I quote

39:53.200 --> 39:53.600
Kidding

39:53.600 --> 39:54.800
I like fucking whales

39:54.800 --> 39:59.200
From US officials saying in effect we're coming for you McAfee

39:59.200 --> 40:01.120
We're going to kill yourself

40:01.120 --> 40:02.480
It's a nice turn of phrase

40:02.480 --> 40:04.320
We're going to arc inside you

40:04.320 --> 40:05.840
We're going to kill yourself

40:05.840 --> 40:09.920
I got a tattoo today just in case I am suicide myself

40:09.920 --> 40:10.720
I didn't

40:10.720 --> 40:12.160
I was whacked

40:12.160 --> 40:13.600
Check out my right arm

40:13.600 --> 40:19.520
And there is again his tattoo with the money there and the whack saying why he was killed

40:19.520 --> 40:23.840
Those tweets are real but also John McAfee was a delusional paranoid drug addict

40:23.840 --> 40:27.840
Who promised to eat his own dick on tv as a way to promote cryptocurrency

40:27.840 --> 40:30.000
Probably as part of a pump and dump activity

40:30.800 --> 40:32.960
This isn't compelling evidence of anything

40:32.960 --> 40:37.360
Like these tweets and him getting a tattoo that says dollar sign whacked

40:37.920 --> 40:41.680
It's not evidence to me of anything other than McAfee was unwell

40:42.240 --> 40:47.680
Yeah and maybe those weren't turns of phrase so much as typos and poor grammar

40:47.680 --> 40:48.400
Swacked

40:48.400 --> 40:50.000
Yeah could have something

40:50.000 --> 40:57.520
Maybe I might not be so much the well-done authorly talents of McAfee

40:57.520 --> 41:01.200
I would love if Alex did also try to go through McAfee's

41:01.200 --> 41:02.400
Yeah just start reading

41:02.400 --> 41:04.000
Just start going through his twitter follow

41:04.000 --> 41:05.600
I'm trying to explain some of this shit

41:05.600 --> 41:07.520
Yeah yeah go for it go for it

41:07.520 --> 41:10.080
Let's let's all start talking about whale fucking

41:10.080 --> 41:12.080
That's what needs to be in the public eye

41:12.960 --> 41:16.240
So Alex needed to jump in front of this really fast

41:16.240 --> 41:16.400
Right

41:16.400 --> 41:18.880
He needed to get a narrative out and

41:18.880 --> 41:20.480
Can't let the cement dry on this one

41:20.480 --> 41:20.800
No

41:20.800 --> 41:21.440
No no no

41:21.440 --> 41:25.520
Within minutes of him being announced dead we're told it's a suicide

41:26.400 --> 41:30.160
Just like we were told with Breitbart it was a heart attack before his body was even cold

41:30.160 --> 41:31.920
And no coroner's examination

41:31.920 --> 41:35.920
And the coroner that finally looked at him then was poisoned by arsenic and died

41:36.880 --> 41:40.800
Political assassination is a very real thing in America a very real thing around the world

41:40.800 --> 41:44.160
So we already talked about this the the outlets that Alex thinks are in on this

41:44.160 --> 41:47.600
Conspiracy did not report that it was a suicide within minutes

41:47.600 --> 41:51.200
There was dry matter-of-fact coverage of the Catalonian statement and then

41:51.200 --> 41:54.960
Eventually Reuters reported the statement that was made by McAfee's lawyer

41:54.960 --> 41:58.560
I strongly suspect that Alex's claim that within minutes it was called a suicide is

41:58.560 --> 42:00.320
Based on random tweets he saw

42:00.320 --> 42:00.720
That sounds

42:00.720 --> 42:01.680
Which is meaningless

42:01.680 --> 42:02.480
Most likely

42:02.480 --> 42:05.760
We did a whole episode about the day after Andrew Breitbart died and

42:05.760 --> 42:08.560
Nothing Alex is saying is real about that case either

42:08.560 --> 42:12.320
The media didn't immediately call it a heart attack and the initial reporting that

42:12.320 --> 42:14.560
It was suspected to be a heart attack

42:14.560 --> 42:18.640
The place that came from and the direct line that everyone was quoting

42:18.640 --> 42:21.600
Was a press release put out by Breitbart's own website

42:21.600 --> 42:22.160
Yeah

42:22.160 --> 42:24.640
There's no conspiracy there

42:24.640 --> 42:28.800
As for the coroner thing that was just a conspiracy narrative that's based on nothing

42:28.800 --> 42:33.360
This was about the death of Michael Cormier a person who worked at the coroner's office

42:33.360 --> 42:37.120
The problem is that he had nothing to do with Breitbart's autopsy and the amount of arsenic

42:37.120 --> 42:40.400
He had in his system was so large that one of the detectives on the case said

42:40.400 --> 42:44.400
It would be impossible to poison someone without much arsenic without them noticing

42:44.400 --> 42:47.520
And people were pretty confused by that case

42:47.520 --> 42:47.760
Yeah

42:48.400 --> 42:49.120
Yeah

42:49.120 --> 42:53.200
Alex can't prove that Cormier's death was a poisoning or like an intentional poisoning

42:53.200 --> 42:53.840
Sure sure sure

42:53.840 --> 42:56.800
And he can't prove that Breitbart didn't die from a heart attack

42:56.800 --> 43:01.840
All he can do is pull at strings real or imagined in order to create a sensational storyline that

43:01.840 --> 43:02.720
Fits his purposes

43:03.280 --> 43:08.000
One of the most important aspects of this is the narrative that the media immediately calls

43:08.000 --> 43:11.200
These death suicides or in Breitbart's case a heart attack

43:11.200 --> 43:13.440
Because that implies that there's a cover-up

43:13.440 --> 43:16.800
And if there's a cover-up that means that there's something to cover up

43:16.800 --> 43:18.800
And that means that it's a murder

43:18.800 --> 43:19.280
Yep

43:19.280 --> 43:24.000
In Breitbart's case Alex was just making up that the media immediately called it a heart attack

43:24.000 --> 43:26.960
And in this case he's doing the same thing with McAfee's death

43:26.960 --> 43:31.440
It's a pattern of behavior that exists not because he's responding to real reporting

43:31.440 --> 43:34.640
But because he's operating from a pre-existing script

43:34.640 --> 43:38.000
Regardless of what any media outlet published about McAfee's death

43:38.000 --> 43:41.440
As soon as Alex heard that he was dead he knew the angle was

43:41.440 --> 43:43.840
That the media immediately called it a suicide

43:43.840 --> 43:44.160
Totally

43:44.160 --> 43:45.120
And that's suspicious

43:45.120 --> 43:45.840
Yeah

43:45.840 --> 43:48.240
The rest of this video is is kind of

43:49.200 --> 43:49.680
Bleh

43:49.680 --> 43:52.000
I mean here Alex is just defending himself

43:52.000 --> 43:52.960
This is nonsense

43:52.960 --> 43:53.920
Of course he's talking about himself

43:53.920 --> 43:57.040
I think the evidence is overwhelming that John McAfee was targeted

43:57.040 --> 44:00.960
He told us why and was killed in a Spanish prison

44:00.960 --> 44:04.160
For the cryptocurrency they believe he had or for other secrets

44:04.160 --> 44:08.160
But regardless his work will live on promoting libertarian ideas of basic freedom

44:08.160 --> 44:09.120
What like

44:09.120 --> 44:12.720
For the cryptocurrency they just want his money?

44:12.720 --> 44:14.640
He doesn't have that much money

44:14.640 --> 44:16.640
He might have a bunch of bitcoin or something

44:16.640 --> 44:17.520
I have no idea

44:17.520 --> 44:18.000
Sure

44:18.000 --> 44:18.240
But like

44:18.240 --> 44:22.880
I'm sure he has tons of money but the people we're talking about are like multi-billionaires

44:22.880 --> 44:24.720
McAfee wasn't a multi-billionaire

44:25.440 --> 44:26.720
Right right right

44:26.720 --> 44:29.840
If the globalists were trying to kill him for his money that's silly

44:29.840 --> 44:30.240
Yeah

44:30.240 --> 44:35.440
Second I don't it's not like you can kill someone and then automatically you just get their bitcoin

44:36.720 --> 44:39.120
No you see you don't understand how blockchain works

44:39.120 --> 44:40.640
I don't think Alex understands that

44:40.640 --> 44:42.880
It operates under highlander rules

44:42.880 --> 44:48.400
If you cut off somebody's head the power immediately it's the quickening it's the bitening

44:48.400 --> 44:52.640
It's basically like in Assassin's Creed when you have auto loot

44:52.640 --> 44:55.600
Yes exactly yeah yeah when it picks it up for you

44:56.640 --> 44:57.280
It's perfect

44:57.280 --> 45:03.440
Um yeah so Alex is saying that the evidence is overwhelming and and I I listen to this

45:03.440 --> 45:04.880
I see no evidence

45:04.880 --> 45:05.280
None

45:05.280 --> 45:07.040
I see a couple of tweets

45:07.040 --> 45:13.040
I see the most reasonable course of action being the explanation for events

45:13.040 --> 45:13.280
Yeah

45:13.280 --> 45:15.280
It's the one that makes the most sense to me

45:15.280 --> 45:15.520
Yeah

45:15.520 --> 45:22.160
I mean if I'm 75 I'm a globe traveling uh rich dude who's escaped over and over and over again

45:22.160 --> 45:22.640
You've gotten

45:22.640 --> 45:23.040
Now I'm

45:23.040 --> 45:25.680
You've gotten outrageously lucky

45:25.680 --> 45:26.240
Totally

45:26.240 --> 45:31.200
You've lived probably one of the most insane lives imaginable

45:31.200 --> 45:31.760
Absolutely

45:31.760 --> 45:36.400
Full of adventure in foreign countries uh ducking and dodging

45:36.400 --> 45:36.880
Totally

45:36.880 --> 45:40.240
Uh boxing above your weight class forever

45:40.240 --> 45:42.480
And what are you gonna what are you gonna get?

45:42.480 --> 45:45.680
You're gonna get another 10 years of life in an American prison?

45:45.680 --> 45:50.880
That's awful you don't want to do that so fucking offer yourself it makes sense

45:50.880 --> 45:51.120
I mean

45:51.120 --> 45:51.600
It does

45:51.600 --> 45:54.880
As tragic as that is and as much as I don't want to minimize

45:54.880 --> 45:58.560
you know people who are struggling with suicidal ideation

45:58.560 --> 46:00.320
There's no way out or anything like that

46:01.360 --> 46:08.960
It is imaginable to put yourself in McAfee's position and be like the indignity of the trial

46:08.960 --> 46:09.280
Yep

46:09.280 --> 46:14.960
The damage that the trial would do to the things that he has made the most important parts of his

46:14.960 --> 46:16.480
life like cryptocurrency

46:16.480 --> 46:16.720
Yep

46:17.600 --> 46:19.120
You could see taking the outdoor

46:19.120 --> 46:19.360
Yeah

46:21.680 --> 46:22.480
I don't know

46:22.480 --> 46:26.000
I think I'm not making any assumptions

46:26.560 --> 46:30.640
I'll let the information guide me to whatever conclusion is there

46:31.840 --> 46:35.920
But based on the statement from the Catalonian Justice Department

46:35.920 --> 46:40.560
Based on the statement from his lawyer that they are saying this is an apparent suicide

46:40.560 --> 46:41.200
Yeah

46:41.200 --> 46:43.840
I don't see a reason to doubt that

46:43.840 --> 46:45.680
The only reasons to doubt that are

46:46.400 --> 46:50.160
Nutty tweets from somebody who tweeted nutty shit all the time

46:50.160 --> 46:50.640
Yeah

46:50.640 --> 46:55.920
I'm not going to take that and that's not going to stand up in any kind of court

46:55.920 --> 46:57.360
Even the court of my mind

46:57.360 --> 47:01.360
Oh this lying liar said something? I guess I must believe it

47:01.360 --> 47:01.760
Yeah

47:01.760 --> 47:02.000
Yeah

47:03.760 --> 47:04.800
I got nothing here

47:04.800 --> 47:10.720
I think the further and maybe larger problem for me is I just don't care

47:10.720 --> 47:13.040
I just don't care that McAfee

47:15.200 --> 47:17.040
He's just not important

47:17.040 --> 47:18.240
He's like a sideshow

47:18.240 --> 47:22.160
It's like it's like a carnival barker and it's like

47:24.480 --> 47:28.720
I just don't see the power that Alex is thinking that he can wield through this

47:28.720 --> 47:29.520
Do you know what I mean?

47:29.520 --> 47:35.520
Yeah that I get what you're saying and I'm not super interested in the case itself

47:35.520 --> 47:39.280
As much as I am the behavior and what it illustrates

47:39.280 --> 47:39.760
Totally

47:39.760 --> 47:44.240
I think that the important thing to take away from this is really understanding that Alex put

47:44.240 --> 47:50.160
out this report that night because when we talk about that concrete idea the idea that

47:50.160 --> 47:55.360
when concrete is wet a leaf that falls on it could leave a permanent impression

47:55.360 --> 47:55.920
You got it

47:55.920 --> 48:02.480
And the information space is fairly similar and when a story when the details aren't out

48:02.480 --> 48:08.640
when there isn't like solidified information surrounding stuff you can make an indentation

48:08.640 --> 48:09.520
in that concrete

48:09.520 --> 48:14.800
Yeah a lot of people are gonna think that Subway has never used tuna in their sandwiches

48:14.800 --> 48:15.520
Exactly

48:15.520 --> 48:17.680
It's already happened it's too late now

48:17.680 --> 48:24.320
And with this Alex is trying to put into his audience's mind before there's any solid

48:24.320 --> 48:30.400
information that the media immediately reported that it was a suicide and that's suspicious

48:30.400 --> 48:32.880
because McAfee tweeted some crazy shit

48:33.520 --> 48:37.360
That's and that you know that it's a consistent behavior

48:37.360 --> 48:45.120
Yeah it's it's one of the most kind of worrying and disgusting things is that the conservative

48:45.120 --> 48:51.040
media has so insulated their listeners and viewers and the like that they can make claims

48:51.040 --> 48:56.320
about any other media because they know you're not going to go check you didn't listen you

48:56.320 --> 49:02.560
don't read the the papers what what person who is reading Infowars articles is then going

49:02.560 --> 49:07.680
to be like and now I'll switch over to the Reuters article that's not happening so you

49:07.680 --> 49:11.920
can just make any fucking claim that you want about what the media said because they'll

49:11.920 --> 49:17.600
believe anything you say about what the media said you own the mainstream media if you are

49:17.600 --> 49:18.800
in the conservative sphere

49:18.800 --> 49:20.480
It's a puppet that you can wield

49:20.480 --> 49:21.200
Exactly

49:21.200 --> 49:26.000
And even if you are like an Alex Jones listener and you go check the Reuters store you'll

49:26.000 --> 49:30.640
see the headline larger than life software mogul John McAfee dies in Spain by suicide

49:30.640 --> 49:34.480
lawyer says there you go and you'll ignore the part in the headline that says lawyer

49:34.480 --> 49:39.200
says why would you be like oh they are reporting that he died exactly you know and it's yeah

49:39.200 --> 49:46.080
it's it's it's a trap and it's a trap that's used intentionally yeah because the false

49:46.080 --> 49:51.360
version of this story or the presumptive version of this story is useful for Alex

49:51.360 --> 49:56.000
Yeah no it's one of their most powerful weapons controlling the narrative that they're telling

49:56.000 --> 50:01.920
you is the narrative they're selling that's just that's that's complete control over

50:01.920 --> 50:08.000
information yeah you know it's just it's just ironclad you can't escape from that so

50:08.000 --> 50:09.360
it's a real bummer

50:11.120 --> 50:16.800
So I think a lot of people probably were reflecting on some things when McAfee the news broke

50:17.920 --> 50:23.840
certainly I was taking a nap and I woke up and I had a text from a friend telling me

50:23.840 --> 50:28.000
about this news and my immediate response was well I bet Hillary did this

50:30.000 --> 50:31.040
Did Hillary do it?

50:31.040 --> 50:33.040
Um maybe

50:33.040 --> 50:37.040
Okay all right all right so jury's still out on that

50:37.040 --> 50:41.840
Yeah I think some people had some fun remembering that time he said that he was

50:41.840 --> 50:43.840
going to eat his dick on television

50:43.840 --> 50:44.640
That was good times

50:45.360 --> 50:47.840
But for Alex he had a slightly different response

50:48.400 --> 50:52.320
A lot of our interviews with him over the years were on YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook

50:52.320 --> 50:57.760
Dozens of them got banned and knocked off we never re-uploaded them to ban.video

50:57.760 --> 51:02.880
This reminded us to so we're going to create a John McAfee archive page and we'll post

51:02.880 --> 51:05.840
all the interviews we've done with him and any other interviews that are out there that

51:05.840 --> 51:08.800
have been censored and so we're going to put a few of the interviews on the tail end of

51:08.800 --> 51:13.360
this right now when we're shooting with him my first interview with him in 2012 and then

51:13.360 --> 51:18.080
we'll endeavor to post some of the other archives in a John McAfee section again at ban.video

51:18.080 --> 51:19.200
We're gonna juice this thing

51:19.200 --> 51:23.200
Oh man guys I just gotta let you know the iron's hot and we better be striking

51:23.200 --> 51:23.700
Yeah

51:23.700 --> 51:24.320
Jeez

51:24.320 --> 51:27.200
No one has told me that his Instagram posted a queue

51:27.200 --> 51:30.320
Quick! Quick! Exploit this! Quick!

51:30.320 --> 51:30.960
Shit

51:30.960 --> 51:36.000
We need a new page we need to get traffic to that page and we need to fill it with ads

51:36.000 --> 51:39.920
Uh somebody call Steve Pachanik and tell him to pretend he was on the yacht

51:39.920 --> 51:41.920
Yes exactly

51:41.920 --> 51:43.920
Uh all right

51:43.920 --> 51:48.560
I'm waiting to find out that Stevie P's is the one who orchestrated the assassination

51:48.560 --> 51:50.560
of McAfee

51:50.560 --> 51:52.560
He's been getting out of pocket

51:52.560 --> 51:54.560
Now my people in Catalonia

51:54.560 --> 51:56.560
Yeah exactly

51:56.560 --> 51:58.560
All right man

51:58.560 --> 52:00.560
So like you already sort of uh

52:00.560 --> 52:06.080
suspected and uh I think anyone would uh Alex does have to make this about himself

52:06.080 --> 52:06.580
Sure

52:06.580 --> 52:12.560
And you know it makes sense he's in a big season right now about how he's under threat

52:12.560 --> 52:13.060
Yes

52:13.060 --> 52:17.560
And the globalists are gonna come for him and they're gonna like kill his family and set him up for it or

52:17.560 --> 52:18.560
Of course, of course

52:18.560 --> 52:20.560
Whatever we heard this like a week ago on his show

52:20.560 --> 52:21.060
Makes sense

52:21.060 --> 52:25.560
And so he can't not take this opportunity to restress that theme

52:25.560 --> 52:27.560
Now just when in closing I want to say to listeners

52:27.560 --> 52:31.560
We've been getting a lot of threats a lot of attacks by the globalists as well

52:31.560 --> 52:35.560
They are making their move worldwide they are killing so many reporters so many journalists

52:35.560 --> 52:39.560
So it'll be a thousand percent a trillion percent clear to infinity

52:39.560 --> 52:43.560
I will never commit suicide I will never kill myself

52:43.560 --> 52:48.560
And if I'm found dead in a jail cell or if I'm found dead in a hotel room with a needle in my arm

52:48.560 --> 52:54.560
Or anything like that it is the deep state that did it and I want them held accountable

52:54.560 --> 52:59.560
If anything happens to me look at Bill Gates, Hillary Clinton, the deep state of the new world order

52:59.560 --> 53:05.560
They are the enemies of America the enemies of humanity and they're the ones that have long histories of serious criminal activity

53:05.560 --> 53:07.560
And never being held accountable

53:07.560 --> 53:10.560
So if anything happens to me the thunderbolt should strike me

53:10.560 --> 53:13.560
And what the godfather says, blame those people

53:13.560 --> 53:16.560
So you know, maybe it is Hillary?

53:16.560 --> 53:18.560
Could be, could be

53:18.560 --> 53:21.560
I would prefer if every time he was like

53:21.560 --> 53:28.560
If they find me with a needle in my arm if he just got really specific into what kind of drugs and alcohol he's doing

53:28.560 --> 53:32.560
If they find me in a hotel surrounded by three empty bottles of Jack Daniels

53:32.560 --> 53:34.560
You know they killed me

53:34.560 --> 53:36.560
That is their fault one hundred percent

53:36.560 --> 53:38.560
Because I'm a Jameson man

53:38.560 --> 53:40.560
Everyone knows it

53:40.560 --> 53:44.560
So this is the only actual content and analysis that Alex put out

53:44.560 --> 53:46.560
And it's as boilerplate as you can get

53:46.560 --> 53:48.560
There's more information that's yet to come out

53:48.560 --> 53:50.560
And Alex knows that once that information is available

53:50.560 --> 53:53.560
His job of rewriting this narrative is going to be next to impossible

53:53.560 --> 53:56.560
The only time to act is immediately

53:56.560 --> 54:03.560
So you get this, a rushed formulaic meaningless insistence that McAfee didn't kill himself based on a couple of years old tweets

54:03.560 --> 54:10.560
It just doesn't matter, and this episode I think is still salient

54:10.560 --> 54:14.560
And I think it's important to do because it's important to recognize these tricks

54:14.560 --> 54:16.560
This is a key trick that Alex uses

54:16.560 --> 54:20.560
And the one thing that I find fucking exciting

54:20.560 --> 54:23.560
And I haven't, you know, we're recording this during the day on Thursday

54:23.560 --> 54:26.560
So we haven't had time to listen to the end of the week shows

54:26.560 --> 54:31.560
Of his, I want to know how he incorporates that cue on Instagram

54:31.560 --> 54:33.560
Because that's going to be tough

54:33.560 --> 54:38.560
Alex has already said that QAnon is a globalist intelligence operation

54:38.560 --> 54:41.560
Which seems like this is going to be something he has to either ignore

54:41.560 --> 54:46.560
Or maybe it's the globalists taunting people on McAfee's Instagram

54:46.560 --> 54:48.560
Could be, could be

54:48.560 --> 54:53.560
It could be that they put it on there to claim responsibility for his murder

54:53.560 --> 54:59.560
That way they put the cue on there so Alex knows that it's the globalists who are doing it

54:59.560 --> 55:01.560
Could be

55:01.560 --> 55:03.560
That could be an option for him

55:03.560 --> 55:06.560
It's going to be an interesting needle to see him thread

55:06.560 --> 55:12.560
And I'm excited to, I'm not really all that excited, but I think it'll be interesting

55:12.560 --> 55:17.560
Maybe actually we're just finally figuring out the real spelling of John McAfee

55:17.560 --> 55:20.560
It's M-Q-A-F-E-E

55:20.560 --> 55:22.560
And he had to change it for the software

55:22.560 --> 55:25.560
Maybe it's him admitting that he's Q

55:25.560 --> 55:27.560
It could be, I don't think so

55:27.560 --> 55:29.560
Probably not

55:29.560 --> 55:33.560
So that's it for the McAfee coverage

55:33.560 --> 55:35.560
Sort of exactly what you'd expect

55:35.560 --> 55:37.560
A little underwhelming

55:37.560 --> 55:39.560
Yeah

55:39.560 --> 55:40.560
Whatever

55:40.560 --> 55:42.560
Yeah, it would be nice if there was one

55:42.560 --> 55:46.560
You know, when the cement is this soft

55:46.560 --> 55:48.560
And you can really just pull off whatever you want

55:48.560 --> 55:50.560
I want one big swing

55:50.560 --> 55:52.560
You gotta give us at least one big swing

55:52.560 --> 56:00.560
Of like a perpetrator, or a group of people, or something other than just like the globalists and Bill Gates

56:00.560 --> 56:02.560
And they want it as crypto

56:02.560 --> 56:06.560
Yeah, yeah, there needs to be a good story behind it that you've got

56:06.560 --> 56:09.560
You know, you can't just be like, oh well the media's lying

56:09.560 --> 56:11.560
You have to give me a better story

56:11.560 --> 56:13.560
Especially when you're lying about what the media's saying

56:13.560 --> 56:16.560
Yeah, when you're not even doing the bare bones of your job

56:16.560 --> 56:21.560
You're making up media coverage in order to justify your made up shit

56:21.560 --> 56:22.560
Right, right, right

56:22.560 --> 56:23.560
It's just stupid

56:23.560 --> 56:28.560
Give me something, give me like, oh, did you know that Brian Stelter was in Spain last month

56:28.560 --> 56:31.560
And then we're like, aha, now I've got it

56:31.560 --> 56:33.560
Give me something like that

56:33.560 --> 56:37.560
Somebody was in Spain around that time

56:37.560 --> 56:38.560
Is what you've got to give me

56:38.560 --> 56:40.560
Yeah, that would be good

56:40.560 --> 56:44.560
But no one was in Spain, however Alex was in New York

56:44.560 --> 56:45.560
Okay

56:45.560 --> 56:49.560
So we went down to do this Flagrant 2 podcast

56:49.560 --> 56:54.560
And, you know, I don't know, Flagrant 2 is a giant podcast

56:54.560 --> 57:00.560
But at the same time it's still like Joe Rogan Jr. Varsity

57:00.560 --> 57:01.560
Sure, sure, sure

57:01.560 --> 57:02.560
For Alex

57:02.560 --> 57:05.560
He can't get on Rogan at least not regularly

57:05.560 --> 57:06.560
Not yet, yeah

57:06.560 --> 57:07.560
Or not enough

57:07.560 --> 57:08.560
Right

57:08.560 --> 57:10.560
And so, you know, he can get on Kill Tony

57:10.560 --> 57:11.560
Sure, sure

57:11.560 --> 57:13.560
That's not going to move the needle enough

57:13.560 --> 57:14.560
No, no it won't

57:14.560 --> 57:16.560
So, you know, you get this publicity tour

57:16.560 --> 57:20.560
He goes all the way to New York presumably either to do this podcast or to do this podcast

57:20.560 --> 57:21.560
And

57:21.560 --> 57:22.560
And something else

57:22.560 --> 57:25.560
Maybe have a deposition or something, who knows

57:25.560 --> 57:29.560
But, yeah, I just, I don't know

57:29.560 --> 57:34.560
It's really hard for me to cover these sorts of appearances that Alex does

57:34.560 --> 57:38.560
Because it's like, alright, I get that this is an attempt at a joke

57:38.560 --> 57:39.560
Right

57:39.560 --> 57:41.560
And I don't think it's funny

57:41.560 --> 57:42.560
Right

57:42.560 --> 57:43.560
And I think the subject matter sucks

57:43.560 --> 57:44.560
Yeah

57:44.560 --> 57:47.560
It's probably somewhere on the bigoted spectrum

57:47.560 --> 57:48.560
Yeah

57:48.560 --> 57:49.560
And whatever

57:49.560 --> 57:50.560
Sure

57:50.560 --> 57:51.560
You know, like

57:51.560 --> 57:52.560
Yeah

57:52.560 --> 57:53.560
I oppose, I oppose this joke

57:53.560 --> 57:57.560
I oppose the message that's underlying this joke

57:57.560 --> 58:01.560
But, I don't know, like where is the line of free speech?

58:01.560 --> 58:03.560
It's objectionable speech to me

58:03.560 --> 58:07.560
But, you know, YouTube should be able to decide whether they want it on the platform or not

58:07.560 --> 58:08.560
But in terms of

58:08.560 --> 58:09.560
Yeah

58:09.560 --> 58:14.560
In terms of our conversation it becomes, it becomes a total mess when you're trying to

58:14.560 --> 58:20.560
Criticize failed or iffy attempts at humor

58:20.560 --> 58:27.560
Yeah, I mean, it's, it's what, we don't cover shows that are just bros talkin' all too often

58:27.560 --> 58:28.560
Yeah

58:28.560 --> 58:33.560
You know, like, bros riffin' doesn't sound interesting or really that, that like, newsworthy I suppose

58:33.560 --> 58:36.560
The exception is like when Alex is on Rogan

58:36.560 --> 58:38.560
And that's just kind of like because it's a vent

58:38.560 --> 58:39.560
Yeah

58:39.560 --> 58:40.560
Level of

58:40.560 --> 58:41.560
Yeah

58:41.560 --> 58:44.560
And, and because Alex really goes for it

58:44.560 --> 58:45.560
He does

58:45.560 --> 58:52.560
And, and, and so like, I was listening to this and I was like, well, okay, we do cover Alex when he's on Rogan

58:52.560 --> 58:58.560
And so like, maybe this is something that we should, you know, like, he, he is a guest on this show

58:58.560 --> 59:02.560
Yeah, I mean if he makes, if he, if he's got something to say then I want to hear it

59:02.560 --> 59:04.560
If he doesn't have anything to say then

59:04.560 --> 59:05.560
He doesn't have much to say

59:05.560 --> 59:06.560
Well

59:06.560 --> 59:09.560
Um, I want to play like the beginning, this is how it starts

59:09.560 --> 59:15.560
Uh, Alex, uh, spoiler alert, comes out wearing tinfoil around his arms like bracers

59:15.560 --> 59:17.560
That is not funny

59:17.560 --> 59:19.560
What's up everybody and welcome to Flavor 2

59:19.560 --> 59:23.560
I am incredibly excited, we have a major, major guest

59:23.560 --> 59:24.560
Huge guest

59:24.560 --> 59:27.560
Huge guest, uh, probably one of the biggest actresses on the planet

59:27.560 --> 59:28.560
Icon

59:28.560 --> 59:34.560
We figured, a real icon, we figured because it is, uh, Women's Empowerment Month, I believe it's Women's Empower Month

59:34.560 --> 59:38.560
We bring on maybe the most powerful woman in the galaxy

59:38.560 --> 59:42.560
Some might say I'm incredibly excited, everybody right now give it up

59:42.560 --> 59:43.560
I wonder who it is

59:43.560 --> 59:47.560
For Gal Gadot, everybody, Wonder Woman is here, Flavor 2

59:47.560 --> 59:49.560
We got Wonder Woman in Wonder Woman

59:49.560 --> 59:51.560
We have Wonder Woman

59:51.560 --> 59:53.560
Yeah

59:53.560 --> 59:58.560
So Alex comes out with a bunch of tinfoil on him and it just turns into a protracted transphobic joke

59:58.560 --> 01:00:10.560
Uh, it's, it's a load of nonsense, but it's, I get this thing where it's, imagine right before they started recording

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:16.560
Alex is like, here's what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna put on a wig and some tinfoil, I'm gonna pretend to be Wonder Woman

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:21.560
Like, that's an idea he had, and then these guys were like, that'll be great

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:22.560
We gotta do that

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:23.560
That'll be great

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:25.560
And you know what, we're gonna sell it

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:26.560
Yes

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:27.560
Oh boy

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:28.560
And Alex taking his shirt off

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:29.560
It's disconcerting

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:31.560
You can take that, you can take that shirt off if you want, Alex

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:32.560
Yo, just go dog

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:33.560
You can go for it if you want

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:36.560
I see you sweating, just go, just go

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:37.560
There's the one

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:42.560
Take it off, take it off, take it off

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:44.560
You guys wanna see this woman's beautiful body?

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:45.560
Yeah

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.560
Yeah, show them fucking heavies

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:54.560
Heavies, heavies, heavies, heavies, heavies, heavies

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:56.560
Hey

01:00:56.560 --> 01:01:01.560
Let's go, brother

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:09.560
So it's moments like this that just like really highlight to me how much of like a duplicitous game everyone is playing

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:10.560
Yeah

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:13.560
Like, Alex is there to try to launder his extremist beliefs to a gullible audience

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:16.560
And he's also trying to bring more customers into his revenue stream

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:17.560
Of course

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:23.560
Simultaneously, these dudes know that if you get Alex to do sensational things it leads to increased attention and traffic

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:27.560
If you get him to run around without his shirt on you might end up going viral on Twitter

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:33.560
You're like, that could be a meme, that could turn into something that is a long-lasting reaction gif meme or whatever

01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:35.560
That's better advertising than you could ever pay for

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:36.560
Totally, totally

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:42.560
So there's this whole game that both of them are playing that is promotional in nature

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:52.560
And it's just like, okay, I guess you're trading the possibility of having these moments for willingly or unknowingly

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:53.560
platforming a monster

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:54.560
Pulling your audience to Alex

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:55.560
Yeah, yeah

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:56.560
It's like, okay, cool

01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:06.560
I just can't believe that people would want to listen to the same social dynamic that one would see at a fucking elementary school

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:08.560
Alex might as well be eating worms

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:09.560
A drunk elementary school

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:13.560
Yeah, just like, eat the worms, eat the worms, eat the worms

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:14.560
It's the same fucking thing

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:24.560
Alex is there to be humiliated for them to exploit and then they laugh at him and he acts, I mean it's so, it's so degrading

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:25.560
No, no

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:26.560
I'm degraded

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:27.560
Well, you're gonna eat even more degraded

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:28.560
Oh no

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:29.560
Because Alex was about to talk about his dick

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:30.560
Oh god

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:32.560
Bro, you got a nice little bulge, yo

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:35.560
Dude, you got a nice pecker, bro

01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:37.560
I have the largest micropenis in North America

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:41.560
Now, women get blown away by it

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:46.560
It looks like a grub worm with ear muscles

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:55.560
You've seen like, seriously, those little balloons you buy at the store get really big

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:56.560
That's me

01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:57.560
So you're a grower

01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:00.560
Man, women go, they go, this is a trick dick

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:03.560
And then like, this hurts

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:05.560
I got a trick dick

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:08.560
So it starts out small and then surprises them later on

01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:09.560
It's like a turtle head, it goes in

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:10.560
Yeah, yeah

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:11.560
It actually goes in

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:12.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:13.560
So then it comes out

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:14.560
Aha

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:22.560
This is not good riffing and it's unbecoming of someone in Alex's position to act like this

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:24.560
Yeah, yeah

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:28.560
It's just, imagine this juxtaposed with him fucking praying on air

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:29.560
I

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.560
I got a trick dick

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:38.560
I mean, it's so much like, I immediately get flashbacks to like, early on doing standup

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:43.560
Working with an established, clean comic headliner

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:47.560
And it's me and a young female comic

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:50.560
She and I are at about the same level of talent

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.560
And then we're at the bar afterwards

01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:55.560
And he starts telling creepy ass fucking jokes right to her face

01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:56.560
Sure

01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:58.560
That is so fucked up and inappropriate

01:03:58.560 --> 01:03:59.560
Yeah

01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:01.560
And you're like, this is not okay

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:03.560
That is what I'm hearing Alex do right now

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:10.560
That creepy ass shit where he presents himself one place as being a pious, god fearing man

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:19.560
And then when there's a social situation where he can fucking take advantage of his goddamn position in the hierarchy

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:21.560
To fuck around with people and I hate it

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:22.560
Yeah

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:23.560
It really lights me up

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:25.560
I think that there's some of that

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:31.560
And then there's some of it too that is just wanting to have people think that you're interesting by kind of like oversharing

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:32.560
Yeah

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:37.560
And I think that early on in my time doing standup I kind of was susceptible to that

01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:43.560
And I certainly would say more stuff on stage than I would be comfortable with now

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:44.560
Sure

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:49.560
You know like, there's sort of an extra version of like, let it all out there man

01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:51.560
Yeah, I'm a truth teller

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:55.560
And I think that that was partially because a youth idiocy

01:04:55.560 --> 01:05:01.560
And not taking myself seriously enough to know that this wasn't appropriate

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:02.560
Yeah

01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:05.560
Alex is 47 years old

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:06.560
Wow

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:11.560
He's been doing this as a, he's been an investigative truth teller reporter for 27 years

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:12.560
Yes

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:14.560
He thinks he's fighting the literal devil

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:15.560
Yeah

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:17.560
He thinks that governments want to kill him

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:18.560
Yep

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:21.560
And he's still like, acts like I did

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:22.560
Hey, you gotta laugh

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:24.560
When I was an early doing comedy guy

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:27.560
Look Dan, you know what, when you're so stressed out you need an outlet

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:34.560
And that outlet is telling two weird bros while they mock you to your face that you've got a weird penis

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:36.560
That makes perfect sense

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:37.560
I guess

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:45.560
I mean it should, I guess if people want to look at him as an

01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:46.560
Yeah

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:47.560
I don't know

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:57.560
The thing that I kept flashing to was these people like these hosts of Flagrant

01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:02.560
And I would say even Rogan probably is this way

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:04.560
Or Tony Hinchcliffe

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:08.560
They have an image of Alex as this

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:09.560
Yeah

01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:13.560
The drunk guy who talks about his dick or yells about aliens

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:17.560
Or like tells them some weird subsection they've never heard of

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:20.560
And he's like, I'm gonna blow your mind, I'm gonna blow your mind, let me tell you

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:23.560
I'm gonna tell you, I talked to the weather weapon guy

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:24.560
Yeah, yeah

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:27.560
That's the image that they have of him

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:30.560
And that's what they think his show is

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:34.560
They haven't listened to his actual show

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:35.560
Probably not, no

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:37.560
They don't know

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:43.560
And when Alex comes on these types of shows, he's not crying about fighting the devil

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:44.560
Right

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:47.560
He's not like yelling all his racist shit

01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:50.560
He's not doing what he does on his show

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:55.560
If these people actually listened to Alex's show, they would either be bored out of their mind

01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:59.560
Or they'd be like, wait a second, this is what Alex does?

01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:02.560
I'm not sure I want to be associated with this

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:03.560
You know, I don't know

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:09.560
Alex's years-long Trojan horse quest to get people to give their life to Jesus

01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:16.560
Do you think that people like these hosts would be like, oh, I want to be a part of this

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:18.560
Bringing people to God

01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:20.560
I mean, I could see this

01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:22.560
I could see them all in their mind

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:23.560
Because they are all these

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:31.560
I mean, the names of the people that we're dealing with are all traffickers in toxic masculinity by trade

01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:37.560
So I could definitely see them being like, oh, you know, we just play it up on our show

01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:39.560
Alex just plays it up on his show

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:41.560
And in real life, he's this guy

01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:43.560
So it's okay for us to be cool with him

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:48.560
Despite not realizing all of the fucking destruction that his show does

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:53.560
Just because he's a character on the show means it's okay for them to be like

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:55.560
Eh, you know what, we'll have him on our show

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:57.560
Where he's the real guy

01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:58.560
See, that's great

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:00.560
And I applaud that, except the reverse

01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:02.560
Yeah, I was gonna say, please do not applaud that

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:03.560
No, I think it's worse

01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:04.560
That's fucked up

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:06.560
Yeah, if someone were to make that argument, I think that

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:08.560
That's what I'm saying

01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:11.560
I'm saying these people are worse than you give them credit for

01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:16.560
Yes, because if the argument is that it's a character and this is the real Alex

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:19.560
That we're hanging out with, broing down with about our dicks

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:23.560
Like, okay, then that person that you're broing down with is a psychopath

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:25.560
Yes, yes

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:27.560
And they are too

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:31.560
I mean, you could absolutely see them saying something like

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:35.560
The crisis actor joke is funny because it's not Alex's fault

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:38.560
It's people taking Alex too seriously

01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:41.560
Who went too far with all that Sandy Hook stuff

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:43.560
Alex is an entertainer, man

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:46.560
If people take it too seriously, it's not Alex's fault

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:49.560
Just like when people take our stuff too seriously

01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:51.560
And it's like, no, we're making a joke

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:55.560
Sure, I made a quote unquote joke about raping a woman

01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:59.560
But that was a joke, I don't know why people are taking it too fucking seriously

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:01.560
It's that type of shit

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:04.560
They even do, you know, touch on that a little bit

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:07.560
Everybody takes me out of context

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:10.560
I find that to be a pretty boring argument

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:14.560
Because I've listened to hundreds and hundreds of hours of Alex's show

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:19.560
I think I got a pretty good sense of what's an actual position and what's him fucking around

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:23.560
And I don't take things that he's fucking around about all that seriously

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:26.560
I think that argument is thin

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:31.560
No, I would say it's a self-serving and delusional argument

01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:33.560
That helps you go to sleep at night

01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:38.560
Because what you're actually doing is exposing people to a fucking monster

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:43.560
And you're helping make it easier for people to accept the bad arguments

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:46.560
And the awful things that Alex does believe

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:50.560
By presenting him in a way that's positive, that's sociable

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:53.560
That is like, hey, we're having fun

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:59.560
And allowing him to perpetuate things that just explicitly aren't true

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:03.560
It's like if Renfield had a fucking podcast

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:05.560
Like, he's putting Dracula on, man

01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:07.560
He's gonna push Dracula on you

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:11.560
Well, I mean, if you want to use Alex's own language

01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:16.560
But there's just things that you allow him to perpetuate that aren't true

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:20.560
So they're talking about Colbert and why Colbert isn't funny anymore

01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:22.560
And here's what Alex says

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:27.560
They admit Charles Schumer, the Senator of New York calls him and says what should be in his bits

01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:28.560
No

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:29.560
That's in the news

01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:30.560
Same thing with

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:31.560
That's almost unbelievable

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:33.560
Some of the funnier late night guys, you should be really funny

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:34.560
You wonder, why aren't they funny now?

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:38.560
They admit in the news that they get calls from Democrat spokespersons

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:41.560
And Senator Schumer goes, I'd like you to talk to this guy

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:44.560
He's my cousin, he's a funny guy

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:48.560
And those guys know that corporately, their job and their contract is

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:50.560
Pursuant to a weird New York Senator

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:52.560
Can you imagine like a Senator calls up

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:54.560
Oh, Andrew, I'd kind of like to see this in your piece

01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:55.560
You say, fuck you, man

01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:56.560
Yeah

01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:59.560
Can you imagine like, I'm out here like, okay, Senator Schumer says I'm supposed to say this now

01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:00.560
Here's Schumer's joke

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:04.560
So this old man can sit there and watch and go, I control that young man

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:10.560
This is entirely about Jimmy Kimmel discussing on air how he'd spoken with Chuck Schumer about the Affordable Care Act

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:14.560
Which you might recall was a super important thing to Jimmy because his son lives with a congenital heart defect

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:18.560
So he was discussing on air, this piece that he did

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:23.560
About how the coverage of pre-existing conditions really matters in a very concrete way

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:24.560
Yes

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:26.560
Kimmel was taking issue with the Graham-Cassidy bill

01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:29.560
Which sought to get rid of some of the provisions of the ACA

01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:34.560
And in preparation he got some assistance from Chuck Schumer's office about the bill's details

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:37.560
Alex has taken that kernel from 2017 and embellished it now

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:43.560
To the point where he's telling these dudes that Schumer is basically the booker and head writer for all late night shows

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:47.560
This isn't joking around and it's not even in the territory of embellishment for effect

01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:52.560
This is just a lie that Alex is specifically deploying to convince these people's audience

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:57.560
That all non-crazy entertainment is just secret globalist programming

01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:03.560
And they're reacting to it with like, no way, that's almost unbelievable

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:08.560
And you're like, why wouldn't you stop for one second and go, that is unbelievable

01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:10.560
No

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:16.560
I mean Alex even gave you an example for you to be like, I know people in comedy

01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:20.560
Of course they too would say, fuck you Chuck Schumer, you're not funny

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:25.560
And the hosts of this show, the two dudes who are the main hosts of it

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:30.560
One of them used to be on MTV's Guy Code and the other one was on Wild and Out

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:34.560
So it's like, they're comedians, people who have worked, they have done stuff

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:36.560
You know people in the industry

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:40.560
All of whom would do, regardless of whatever political affiliation you have

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:45.560
Comedians are very very aggressive about you shutting the fuck up

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:51.560
And they probably have some exposure to some of the things that Alex is being completely duplicitous about

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:56.560
And it's just not worth it to have an actual conversation about it, I don't think

01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:00.560
If you've been on the Guy Code or Wild and Out or that kind of stuff

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:07.560
There's no way you haven't interacted with people who literally work at SNL or Colbert or the like

01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:12.560
Like, that's, they're there, they're everywhere, yeah, I mean, that's bananas

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:14.560
And that means you know Chuck Schumer

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:17.560
Yeah, well, that means they're taking orders from Chuck Schumer

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:23.560
Yeah, so I found largely listening to this to be, like I have already said, intolerable

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:29.560
I found it so boring, just ha ha ha

01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:32.560
That's the kind of noise, just put that for two and a half hours

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:34.560
Look at us being bros

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:36.560
Yeah, so I turned it off after about an hour

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:42.560
But there was one really important thing that came up a couple times in the first hour

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:48.560
And this is Alex trying to formulate a way to justify some of his bigotries

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:51.560
And I found this really really interesting

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:52.560
Here we go

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:57.560
Because all the Renaissance is, it's not a utopia, it's saying all the old fucking weird shit, we throw it out

01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:00.560
All the old weird shit's like, oh rainbow flags, oh look, black people

01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:02.560
It's all exploiting gay people and black people

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.560
There's nothing to do with rainbow flags and gay people

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:06.560
They're just literally sitting there putting that out

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:11.560
We need a total Renaissance to overthrow the entire thing and empower everybody

01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:14.560
Well you're saying, you're not saying let's get rid of rainbow flags and black people

01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:15.560
That's what it sounded like

01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:18.560
You're saying they're mascotting the rainbow flags and the black people

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:20.560
No, yeah, get rid of the front

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:24.560
Imagine if I walked in here and I said, I really like black people

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:26.560
Do what I say, I like black people

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:28.560
You're a fucking opportunist

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:30.560
I see what you're saying, I see what you're saying

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:31.560
But this is interesting

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:34.560
No, no, I'm saying don't get rid of rainbow flags and black people

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:37.560
No, get rid of the people that are using rainbow flags and black people

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:39.560
I'm just saying stop listening to them

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:44.560
Like when some defense contractor has a rainbow flag you're like, dude, that's not you

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:47.560
You're killing people but you're using this rainbow flag so we think you're

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:48.560
That's protection

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:57.560
I've listened to countless hours of Alex's show and I honestly don't think that that's an idea that I've ever heard him articulate like that

01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:59.560
I really haven't either

01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:00.560
I think it's intentional

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:05.560
This is a very attractive point and honestly I don't actually disagree that much with how he's framing it

01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:11.560
No, I think he's, well, I mean you see Nancy Pelosi and the like in a fucking, yeah, yeah

01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:18.560
I see, you know, businesses do pay lip service to communities in meaningless ways in order to garner goodwill

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:23.560
While their actions might not be as supportive as those words may imply

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:28.560
Rainbow flags and donations to Trump do not go together and yet somehow

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:32.560
I think that happens a lot and it's a part of the shallowness of the nature of corporations

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:37.560
We treat corporations like people and all of a sudden they have a brand and a persona to cultivate

01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:39.560
And part of that is trite social media gestures

01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:41.560
And I think a lot of people see through that

01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:46.560
By framing Alex's opposition to things like black people and rainbow flags this way

01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:51.560
Alex is trying to hook the audience by appealing to something that they could easily believe

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:56.560
This could possibly be the belief that Alex has that everyone says is racist

01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:58.560
You know all those times Alex gets called a racist?

01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:04.560
It's gotta be because people are misrepresenting his stance against corporate use of Black Lives Matter and rainbow flags

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:07.560
That's gotta be it, he's not actually a racist

01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:12.560
That's what Alex wants the audience to think because the reality is that Alex is a gigantic racist

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:17.560
And if the audience knows that going in, they won't ever make it to the Infowars store

01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:23.560
Trust me, the difference in how Alex responds to a murder when the victim is black or when the victim is white

01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:25.560
Has nothing to do with corporate signaling

01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:30.560
His behavior is explicitly racist, it's homophobic, it's transphobic

01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:39.560
He is those things and he's being allowed to launder this in a way that's appealing to not only the hosts but the audience

01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:43.560
And gives them a way to be like, oh yeah everyone says Alex is racist

01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:52.560
He doesn't like this corporate thing where you put a rainbow flag up during Pride Month when you're a bigot

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:54.560
Or you're doing horrible things

01:16:54.560 --> 01:17:02.560
It's a valid criticism that's trying to be used as a shield for bigotry

01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:05.560
Right, but I mean that's the feedback loop

01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:10.560
That's the feedback loop of conspiracy theorists and shitty politicians

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:14.560
Is that when the system is so corrupt and so transparent bullshit

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:21.560
It is easy for you to take a pot shot like this and get people towards more conspiratory laden bullshit

01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:25.560
Because obviously Nancy Pelosi is fucking lying to you

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:27.560
That's not hard to jump to

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:35.560
It's a miniature version of how Alex's opposition to the Iraq war can trick you into thinking that he is an ally

01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:37.560
Or ideologically on the same page

01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:43.560
Right, and then corrupt and shallow assholes use that conspiracy theory to get elected

01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:47.560
When they corrupt the government and make it less functional than it was before

01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:52.560
Then your conspiracy theories get even stronger because the government is so obviously corrupt

01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:55.560
And it creates that feedback loop of destruction

01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:58.560
If it were possible, I mean I've said this so many times

01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:02.560
But the greatest weapon that the Democrats have against the Republican party

01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:06.560
Is just the governing effectively and they cannot do that

01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:07.560
They simply cannot

01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:08.560
True

01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:10.560
And that's why we get into these situations

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:17.560
I think that even if the Democrats wanted to or had a unified will to govern well

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:18.560
I don't think it's possible

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:19.560
No, that's probably true

01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:21.560
It's probably too late now

01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:23.560
It's probably way too late now

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:25.560
Everyone can just do their best

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:27.560
Man, they really had a shot

01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:29.560
They really had a shot 2008 to 2010

01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:32.560
If they had just got their shit together

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:35.560
Man, we would have avoided so much

01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:38.560
We would have had a right wing terrorism problem

01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:39.560
Yeah, that's true

01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:41.560
We would have had an extreme much faster

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:43.560
Yeah, it wasn't going to stop

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:51.560
Yeah, so I just, I grow weary of these laundering attempts of Alex

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:56.560
And I just, I don't think people don't have the right to do it

01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:57.560
Sure

01:18:57.560 --> 01:19:02.560
I don't think people are, you know, should be banned

01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:04.560
I don't know, I mean it's the platform's choice

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:06.560
They can do whatever the fuck they want

01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:07.560
Sure

01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:13.560
I don't think that, you know, I don't think they should be arrested or anything for this

01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:17.560
But I wish people would consider a little bit more what they're doing

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:24.560
I wish that, like, if these guys want to have Alex Jones on their show

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:27.560
I would like them to ask about the devil

01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:32.560
I would like them to ask about, like, valid criticisms about him

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:39.560
As opposed to allowing him to present his very, very clear racism as opposition to corporate signaling

01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:40.560
Right

01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:45.560
I would like it if they allow, you know, this is a rare opportunity

01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:50.560
Where you have Alex there, you could ask him digging questions

01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:55.560
And instead just allow him to poach your audience

01:19:55.560 --> 01:20:00.560
I mean, there's really only, at this point the bar is so low

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:04.560
So there's only two things that happen if you have Alex Jones on

01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:05.560
It's obviously you're right

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:11.560
You have either the option to fucking eviscerate him

01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:15.560
And then you will not be on his level, you will be over the bar

01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:19.560
Or you do this, in which case you are under the bar right next to Alex

01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:22.560
I have no sympathy for people

01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:27.560
You've turned flagrant 2 into Infowars in my mind

01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:28.560
More or less

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:29.560
The end

01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:31.560
Like, I have no interest in you as people

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:33.560
You should fucking stop

01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:36.560
And if you don't get that and if you don't make a change towards that

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:38.560
Then fuck off forever

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:39.560
You're just Infowars

01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:45.560
Yeah, I think we have probably a very unique perspective

01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:48.560
And I don't mean unique in, like, necessarily an overly positive way

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:52.560
But a perspective that other people don't have because we focus so much on Alex Jones

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:53.560
Sure

01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:57.560
And that is that, like, I think that we have enough of an awareness of what this dude does

01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:03.560
And what he's up to, his history, the way he lies, the positions that he actually has

01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:08.560
That people who would choose to associate with him

01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:11.560
It's your right to

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:12.560
Sure

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:15.560
But we know that you are him

01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:16.560
Yeah, yeah

01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:22.560
I don't give a fuck about Joe Rogan or Tim Dillon or these fucks or any of these people

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:25.560
You are next to Alex Jones forever

01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:29.560
You're at the rally, if you're at a rally surrounded by Nazis

01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:31.560
I get maybe you feel like you're not

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:34.560
But if you stay at that rally, guess who's a Nazi now

01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:35.560
You have Alex on a second time

01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:36.560
Exactly

01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:40.560
I mean, I guess it probably boosts numbers

01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:43.560
It probably helps with traffic

01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:45.560
And these guys have a bunch of ads on their show

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:46.560
Hey

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:49.560
Hope their sponsors don't dislike Alex being on

01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:53.560
It's okay if you destroy the world if your listeners go up

01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:54.560
It's fine

01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:55.560
It's the trade-off

01:21:55.560 --> 01:22:04.560
I just don't understand being this irresponsible with presentation

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:05.560
Yeah

01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:07.560
That's really what it comes down to

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:12.560
It really comes down to like a part of you just breaks down and you just go like

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.560
Do you guys just not care?

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:17.560
Like is that really it? You just don't give a shit?

01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:22.560
I mean it feels like that's got to be the most simple explanation

01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:24.560
Yeah, you don't care about your show

01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:26.560
You don't care about the people who listen

01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:28.560
And you don't care about what happens because of it

01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:31.560
That's what you're telling me when you have Alex Jones on

01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:38.560
Right, I mean like because here we have a completely dissonant presentation

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:43.560
A week ago on his show, Alex is talking about how we're all dead

01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:47.560
Yes he was

01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:48.560
Yes he was

01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:52.560
He's talking about how the globalists are going to kill everybody

01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:53.560
Yeah

01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:56.560
And you know like I gotta stand and fight against these

01:22:56.560 --> 01:23:02.560
I promise you I will take everything in my ability and fake crying and shit

01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:05.560
And within the week he's in New York wearing a wig

01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:08.560
Hey my penis is like a turtle

01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:10.560
It's great, great

01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:11.560
What are you doing?

01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:13.560
What are any of us doing?

01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:14.560
Yeah

01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:15.560
Brutal

01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:20.560
And then Alex comes back and tries to present McAfee's death as a murder

01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:22.560
Which can only serve to incite his audience

01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:23.560
Yeah just unreal

01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:25.560
This is just nonsensical

01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:27.560
It's just so fucked up

01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:33.560
It's so fucked up how easy it is to jangle the keys of like

01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:37.560
Hey I'm a fucking performer in front of these idiots

01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:40.560
And then they'll just be like hey let's talk about dicks for two hours

01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:42.560
Fuck off

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:46.560
And again maybe I don't know I watched most of the first one

01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:49.560
And it was not in depth or interesting

01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:50.560
Yeah

01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:53.560
I watched the first hour of this one before I turned it off

01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:58.560
And the only thing I found interesting really was this presentation of Alex's racism

01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:01.560
As being opposed to corporate artifice

01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:02.560
Yeah

01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:07.560
And I don't know I guess I could have listened to the rest of it

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:08.560
Meh

01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:15.560
Yeah I mean again if it weren't so reasonable to assume that they are corrupt lying pieces of shit

01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:20.560
I think it would be harder to launder your racism behind

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:22.560
See look at those corrupt lying pieces of shit

01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:26.560
I would like it if this was actually a long game which it's not

01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:29.560
But they were trying to lull Alex into a false sense of security

01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:33.560
Yeah you missed the last half hour where they just fucking nailed him

01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:35.560
Nailed him to a wall

01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:37.560
I doubt it

01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:38.560
Anyway

01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:39.560
Anyway

01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:45.560
I'm somewhat excited to see how Alex tries to incorporate that cue from John McAfee's Instagram

01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:48.560
So we'll check in on that on Monday I believe

01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:49.560
Yeah

01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:52.560
But yeah until then Jordan we have a website
