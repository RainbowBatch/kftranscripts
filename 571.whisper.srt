1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,960
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying, we are the bad guys, knowledge

2
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,960
fight.

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,840
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying, we are the bad guys, knowledge

4
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,840
fight.

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,840
Dan and Jordan, knowledge fight.

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,840
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her.

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,840
I need, I need money.

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,840
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her.

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,840
Andy and Kansas.

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,840
Andy and Kansas.

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,840
Stop it.

12
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,840
Andy and Kansas.

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,840
Andy and Kansas.

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,840
It's time to pray.

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,840
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air.

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,840
Thanks for holding us.

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,840
Hello, Alex.

18
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,840
I'm a first-time caller.

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,840
I'm a huge fan.

20
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,840
I love your room.

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,840
Knowledge fight.

22
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:55,760
Knowledgefight.com I love you.

23
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,040
Hey, everybody.

24
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,040
Welcome back to Knowledge Fight.

25
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,040
I'm Dan.

26
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,040
I'm Jordan.

27
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,040
We're a couple dudes.

28
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,100
We like to sit around, drink novelty beverages, and talk a little bit about Alex Jones and

29
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,600
also worship at the altar of Selene.

30
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,600
Damn it.

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,600
Autopilot, baby.

32
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,600
Hey, hey, it's okay.

33
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,600
It's okay.

34
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,600
It's okay.

35
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,600
It's okay.

36
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,540
We got a sneaky steak episode.

37
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,120
You don't have to nail it perfectly.

38
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,960
I didn't even realize that until after it had come out of my mouth that I had, yeah.

39
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,440
No, I didn't hear it at all.

40
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,440
Wow.

41
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,920
I heard you say worship at the altar of Selene and then just let it, yeah.

42
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,840
I think I've been making so many buttons with Selene on them that it's just like-

43
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,880
It's in your brain all the time.

44
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,880
That's where that lives.

45
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,480
It's an unspoken situation.

46
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,480
Yes.

47
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,480
Yes, Dan.

48
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,040
But I do have a question for you.

49
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,040
Sure.

50
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,040
What's your bright spot today?

51
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:49,480
My bright spot today, Jordan, is a lot of nice messages that people have sent with the

52
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,460
requests for buttons.

53
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:56,920
As I make these buttons, unfortunately, there's so many that I cannot possibly respond to

54
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,920
most of these.

55
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,920
Yeah.

56
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,880
So please just know that I have read these messages and I very much appreciate them,

57
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,960
and their buttons will be sent as they're received.

58
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,960
Also-

59
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,640
Here's your response to the message, some fucking buttons.

60
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,640
That's right.

61
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,040
I'm taking a weirdly aggressive tone.

62
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,040
Yes.

63
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,040
That is how I'm feeling.

64
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,120
Also, something that has come up a number of times is people wanting to pay for postage,

65
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,200
particularly international wonks, thinking like, I'll pay something for postage.

66
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,400
That's a really nice thing, but I want this to be a gift for folks.

67
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,560
I appreciate that, but I don't want to accept that, but I also don't want to be disrespectful

68
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,560
to that generosity.

69
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,560
Of course not.

70
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,720
So if anybody feels the desire to, here's what I would say, this is my blanket response.

71
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,140
Feel free to give a little donation to a charity that you support, or you think that Selene

72
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:52,520
would support, and do it in the name of my cat.

73
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,520
Yes.

74
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,160
We will all worship at the altar of Selene eventually, because that is the name that

75
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,000
will be donating to every cause from now on.

76
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,600
Right, donate to a charity in my cat's name, and that'll be good for the postage.

77
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,240
That'll be good for everybody.

78
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,240
Yeah.

79
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,760
So my bright spot was thinking about that.

80
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,260
Imagine if we were as wealthy as Bill Gates, and you were just like, ah, our foundation

81
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,040
is named the Cult of Selene.

82
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,040
Let's move on.

83
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,200
Yeah, that wouldn't start any conspiracies at all.

84
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,200
No problem at all there.

85
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,160
We're donating $3 billion in the name of the Cult of Selene.

86
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,160
Uh-oh.

87
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,160
Uh-oh.

88
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,160
Yeah.

89
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,160
What's your bright spot, Jordan?

90
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,160
Dan, my bright spot is Wimbledon!

91
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,320
Goddammit, what a tennis.

92
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
Another tennis one.

93
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,480
No, this year, because of the, I don't know if you noticed, but the past year has been

94
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,480
rough.

95
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,480
Yeah.

96
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,080
So this year, the French Open and Wimbledon were only a month apart, and I will tell you

97
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,240
this, inspiring shit, Dan.

98
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,240
Whoa.

99
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,240
Andy Murray.

100
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,240
Andy Murray.

101
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,240
The Andy Murray?

102
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,240
The Andy Murray.

103
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,240
The Andy Murray.

104
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,600
Former member of the Big Four, back when there was a Big Four and Andy was not kicked out

105
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,600
of it.

106
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,040
Former world number one, destroyed by injuries.

107
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,000
He's old as shit now.

108
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,380
Back in Wimbledon, for the first time in years, won his first match.

109
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:19,120
So did Federer, coming back after his injuries at Wimbledon, my friend.

110
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,120
Whoa.

111
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,400
This is a big deal.

112
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,080
So anyway, that's my bright spot.

113
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,080
Oh.

114
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,800
I've got a lot of energy.

115
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,040
Andy Murray is an amazing person.

116
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,520
I understand that, but that was like Charlie Brown's teacher to me.

117
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,560
That was just, wah wah, wah wah wah wah wah.

118
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,440
I could not understand a word you were saying.

119
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,440
This is why I keep my love to myself.

120
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,440
Yeah.

121
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:46,520
I want to care, and I want to join you in the things that make you excited, but I could

122
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,480
not, like my eyes glazed over.

123
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:55,880
I'd listen to you talk about Christian Ska on a podcast on my own time, too.

124
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:01,240
Well, that's because I have interesting thoughts about it, unlike you.

125
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,240
Unlike me and tennis?

126
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,240
No, I understand.

127
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,240
I understand completely.

128
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:12,320
I have some more thoughts about Survivor, if you're interested.

129
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,800
So Jordan, instead of some wonk shout-outs today, one of the things I wanted to do since

130
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,440
we're doing a Sneaky Snake Wednesday episode here, I wanted to get into the mailbag, because

131
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,440
it's been a little while.

132
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,440
It has been a while.

133
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,680
We have a little bit of catching up to do.

134
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,480
So Steve and London, I want to give you a thanks for the Department of Truth graphic

135
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,480
novel.

136
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,480
Yes, thank you very much.

137
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,160
Appreciate that.

138
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:41,480
Also Jase sent some cool shirts, those Q shirts, those Q Meme shirts kind of thing, from Infidel

139
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:46,280
Meme Wear, and I went over to their website and checked out some of the designs.

140
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,800
They're pretty cool.

141
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,400
I think there's one I may end up getting a hoodie.

142
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
This is not sponsored.

143
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,920
This isn't spawn-con, but thank you for the shirt and cool stuff.

144
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,920
Thank you very much.

145
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:06,760
Also, Keith and Laurel sent a care package a while back, and I have been horrible about

146
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,640
giving a thank you, and I really appreciate it.

147
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,400
Thank you, folks.

148
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,520
Giving that horrible into lore-able, and thank you very much, Keith and Laurel.

149
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:20,720
You're a basket of lore-ables.

150
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,720
So thank you so much.

151
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,880
Also this is something that we forgot to do, and I felt a little bit guilty about it, and

152
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,640
that was when we were giving a thank you to Bex.

153
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,760
Bex sent that ukulele, the pink ukulele that we were very confused about, and it turns

154
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,120
out it was for you, because of Steven Universe.

155
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,480
Steven Universe, pink lion!

156
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:46,040
And then I got a green ukulele from Bex because of plants, but what I forgot to do was Bex

157
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:51,120
requested that I give a shout-out to Quicksilver on the Discord, and I forgot to do that, and

158
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,080
I would like to write that wrong by saying, what's up, Quicksilver?

159
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,800
Hey, Quicksilver on the Discord.

160
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,760
I have no idea what any of this means.

161
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,800
This is also Charlie Brown's teachers.

162
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,660
So Jordan, let's get heavy.

163
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:10,580
Giving someone life is giving someone death.

164
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:15,680
You could say that life is death.

165
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,680
You could.

166
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,680
You could.

167
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,680
Happy birthday, J.G.

168
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,680
Gunner!

169
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,120
Hope you had a good one.

170
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,840
Also, Dexter reached out and wanted us to wish a happy birthday to Zoe.

171
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,840
Oh, okay.

172
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,840
Zoe, happy birthday.

173
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,440
Wow, you can't be named Dexter and wish a happy birthday after opening with, giving

174
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,840
someone life is giving someone death.

175
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,080
I have never watched that show.

176
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,320
I don't think you need to.

177
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,720
I think you get the reference.

178
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,720
I do.

179
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,720
He kills serial killers.

180
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,200
He kills people.

181
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Mm-hmm.

182
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,200
Yeah.

183
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,200
Cool.

184
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,200
I heard the ending was bad.

185
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Probably.

186
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,200
I never watched the show either.

187
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:52,440
Also, Renee checked in and wanted to wish Rosemary a happy birthday, and this is fun

188
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,600
because Rosemary recently reached out and wanted to wish Renee a happy birthday.

189
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Yeah, of course.

190
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,600
Of course.

191
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,600
So turn about is fair play.

192
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
Of course.

193
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,920
Also, Renee says, she's the best friend I could have, and thanks for putting up with

194
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,920
me.

195
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,920
Happy birthday, Rosemary.

196
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,160
Unfortunately, life is death.

197
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
Life is death.

198
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,160
According to Alex Jones.

199
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,160
Uh, unfortunately.

200
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,160
Yeah.

201
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,160
So, Jordan, today we're in the past.

202
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,160
Ooh.

203
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,160
I like the past.

204
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,840
We're digging into the past, and we're going to be talking about May 22nd through 27th,

205
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,840
2003.

206
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,840
2003.

207
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,840
Yeah.

208
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,840
No blackjack.

209
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,840
No.

210
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,840
Dealer got blackjacked.

211
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,840
Yes.

212
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,920
Um, and, oof, not great.

213
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,920
Not a great stretch of time.

214
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,720
If I'm going to be perfectly honest with you, there's some funny things that happen, but

215
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,520
in terms of, like, if you're looking for anything in-depth, I am afraid you're not going to

216
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,520
find it here.

217
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,520
Not going to happen?

218
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,520
No.

219
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,520
May 22nd, not the best day of the year.

220
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,580
22nd and 23rd, a lot of it is talking about Bilderberg.

221
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,580
A lot of it is talking about the same sort of Bilderberg conspiracies that we've discussed

222
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:57,980
over and over again, and it's very boilerplate, fairly boring, and that's Thursday and Friday.

223
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,040
Alex doesn't have a Sunday show at this point.

224
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,040
Right.

225
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,000
Monday is a repeat of a show from the past week.

226
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Wow.

227
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Because I think it's Memorial Day.

228
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Oh, okay.

229
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That makes sense.

230
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,640
And then, so Tuesday, he comes back on the 27th, and there's a little bit of interesting

231
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,600
callers maybe, but, like, there is nothing going on.

232
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
Oh, man.

233
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,960
It is a wasteland.

234
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,960
I like how we've gotten so far into this show that a Bilderberg conspiracy, we're like,

235
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,360
Jesus, that's quaint.

236
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,360
Back in the day.

237
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,360
It kind of is.

238
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,360
Oh, Bilderberg, yeah.

239
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,360
They were scary back then.

240
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,360
Oh, man.

241
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,600
Bill Gates is killing everyone now!

242
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,480
Bill Gates-ter-berg.

243
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,200
There's one thing about the people that he has to talk about Bilderberg that I think

244
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:45,440
is worth pointing out, but in terms of the actual conspiracies, they're all just exactly

245
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,640
the same stuff, as always.

246
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,640
Yeah.

247
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,640
So...

248
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,600
I feel like a pertinent question every opening of the show is just going to be like, hey,

249
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,160
are we going to be getting into Blood Libel today, Dan?

250
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,160
Yep.

251
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,160
That's what I thought.

252
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,120
Do you say Bilderberg in 2003?

253
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,840
I'm guessing anti-Semitism might come quicker than you think.

254
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:12,120
So we start here on the 22nd, and not much is going on until Alex takes some calls.

255
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:19,880
He takes some calls fairly early in the episode, and Alex, I think he's trying, he's Mr. Brightside.

256
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,880
He's talking to this caller.

257
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,880
Okay.

258
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,400
Yeah, I just wanted to tell you, like, what I do, so, like, if other people are listening,

259
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
they'll do the same.

260
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:31,920
Like, I make, like, books with news stories, and I pass them all out, and I pass out your

261
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,240
movies, and 9-1-1 is the best one.

262
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,800
That's amazing.

263
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,920
Well, we're getting 90% wake up with Road to Tyranny of People.

264
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,200
Yeah, I get a lot of people who, yeah, they wake up and stuff, but, like, some of my friends,

265
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,440
like, if they even start talking to me about it, like, they're girlfriends or wives, you

266
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,600
know, like, give them a look, you know, they're not allowed to talk to me.

267
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,400
Most of my friends don't even talk to me anymore.

268
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
Man.

269
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,400
Man.

270
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
Don't blame the girlfriends.

271
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:06,880
Yeah, everyone's waking up, but now they won't talk to me anymore because their girlfriends

272
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,200
won't let them.

273
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
That's very sad.

274
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,080
That, that, uh, that is unfortunate.

275
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,920
That is, that is bad.

276
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,840
I need, I need corroborating evidence on we're getting 90% wake up.

277
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,840
Well, actually-

278
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,240
I need a survey response.

279
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,720
I need, uh, something.

280
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,720
I need something.

281
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,720
A Rasmussen poll.

282
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,160
You can't, look, I remember back when I first started out my job, one of the ways that we

283
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,600
marketed was with direct mail campaigns and you get like a 0.5% response.

284
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,360
That was the industry average.

285
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,560
If you're telling me, if you're telling me you're getting 90% wake up out of this, I

286
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,760
got to know what you're doing.

287
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,760
Yeah.

288
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:51,480
It's like, if you're getting 90% response, uh, to something, it's gotta be like heroin.

289
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,480
Yeah, totally.

290
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,480
Totally.

291
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,520
Or, or, or sophisticated brainwashing.

292
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:01,800
Um, so I actually do have a little bit of insight into this because Alex was talking

293
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:07,360
to another caller and he gives out DVDs to people and he's like, I'm getting a hundred

294
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:13,160
percent response from people, a hundred percent wake up and they talk about it.

295
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:20,280
And the way that this guy's defining that is that everybody who takes the DVD seems

296
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,060
happy about it.

297
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,840
But still there's a lot of people who are not taking the DVDs.

298
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,520
Which also means, um, they didn't necessarily watch it.

299
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,520
Yeah.

300
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,640
I don't know if there's follow up with these people about the content of it.

301
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,800
I don't know.

302
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,500
Uh, but this caller in particular, this first one is just really bumming me out because

303
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,720
you know, you can really see what this looks like in real life.

304
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,040
You know what this looks like in real life.

305
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,040
Yep.

306
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,200
They're telling you weird shit and then their girlfriend's like, look, we can't have him

307
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,200
at parties anymore.

308
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,920
He really freaks out my normal friends.

309
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,920
Totally.

310
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,920
Totally.

311
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,920
Yep.

312
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,200
He said something incredibly rude because somebody challenged him on this and he freaked

313
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,300
out because you're not awake.

314
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,360
We can't live that way.

315
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,720
That's not how we live.

316
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,080
If that guy wants to be over there by himself listening to Alex, fine.

317
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,080
Yeah.

318
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:20,560
Um, so this behavior also apparently extends to digital stuff with this caller.

319
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,560
Sure.

320
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,800
Now every seed sprouts the first year and they're dormant.

321
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,360
I email stories like when people send me them stupid emails with like, you know, it's forwarded

322
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,780
a thousand times.

323
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,120
I still all them emails.

324
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:39,000
I email like Post Gazette and Trib stories and uh, and there's links with your movie

325
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
on there.

326
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,120
I emailed that to people.

327
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,840
I probably emailed like thousands and I probably got back like, like 20 responses.

328
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,560
I got like five thank yous and most people, you know, tell me I'm crazy or where'd you

329
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,560
get my email from?

330
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,560
You know, that's about a half a percent.

331
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,960
All right sir, I appreciate the call.

332
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,960
Yeah.

333
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,780
He's one of those weirdos that thinks the world is round.

334
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,240
He's definitely a weirdo.

335
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,640
He's definitely a weirdo.

336
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:10,380
He's getting chain emails, saving people's email addresses, spamming them, and then when

337
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,720
they respond, how did you get my email?

338
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,280
He keeps sending them Info Wars stuff.

339
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,760
That's, that's, that's harassment.

340
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:24,620
I would say, uh, that's an interesting, look, I will give them this.

341
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:29,280
That is an innovation towards chain emails that I had not even considered that you could

342
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:34,240
essentially turn those into your own mailing list and just bother people for the rest of

343
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,240
their lives.

344
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,240
Yeah.

345
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,720
I mean, you could do that.

346
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,600
You'd also have to recognize if you do that, you're a piece of shit.

347
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,600
Yes, there is that.

348
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,640
They're not all innovations are good.

349
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,040
No, I will agree with that.

350
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,360
So Alex gets another call and this guy has got a bad question and Alex has a worse answer.

351
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,680
Alex, can I ask you a real quick question before the break there?

352
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,680
Sure.

353
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:02,160
Someone told me that, uh, there, uh, the 9-11 attack, that, uh, there are 7,000 Jews that

354
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,600
are employed in the World Trade Center.

355
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,440
They were not employed at work that day.

356
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,940
You ever hear anything about that?

357
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,940
That is true.

358
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,620
MSNBC checked into it and said the urban legend was true.

359
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,140
Also the Jewish newspapers have reported they were told not to go to work.

360
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,440
That is a confirmed fact.

361
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,820
That's so fucked up.

362
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:22,580
I don't think it needs to be said that Alex is completely wrong and lending credibility

363
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:26,780
to an explicitly anti-Semitic conspiracy theory about 9-11 here.

364
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:30,700
This is lazy, sloppy behavior that only serves to validate the complete bullshit that this

365
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,120
caller has heard from his bigot friends.

366
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,220
And Alex is just using his platform as a voice of authority or certainty on the subject in

367
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,320
a way that is abhorrent.

368
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,780
You can very easily find the names of many Jewish victims of the 9-11 attack.

369
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:47,280
Some were on planes, some were firefighters who died trying to save their fellow person's

370
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,820
lives and many worked at the World Trade Center or at the Pentagon.

371
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,440
I could name specific names because I can.

372
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,260
I can find them.

373
00:15:55,260 --> 00:16:01,300
And I've read biographic sketches of these people, little mini, mini obituaries, but

374
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,880
I'm not going to get into specifics out of respect for those people's memories.

375
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,460
And it wouldn't change anybody's mind anyways.

376
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,740
This narrative was a baseless claim that was made to demonize the Jewish population of

377
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,460
the United States and to imply some kind of complicity in the attack.

378
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,860
Alex should be deeply ashamed of this response.

379
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:22,860
I can't believe we got to the very first time in 2003 that the Jews were blamed for something

380
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,620
that they had nothing to do with.

381
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:29,500
I don't think this is the first time even in Alex's show in 2003 that we've gotten there,

382
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:36,420
but it was, I thought that that was bad on Alex's part.

383
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:40,500
I just think that they're, like this caller, they're going out to break.

384
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:46,700
He's saying, hey, is it true that all the Jewish people were told to stay home?

385
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,240
Yes, that is true.

386
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,020
It costs you nothing to just be like, no.

387
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,020
No.

388
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,020
Actually, that is nonsense.

389
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:57,760
Yeah, there's no other, I mean, there's just no interpretation of that that doesn't wind

390
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:03,220
up with the Jews were involved in the planning and the attack.

391
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:11,780
And it's specifically the, capital V, capital J, the Jews, not like these people, not a

392
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:16,060
group of them, the entirety of Judaism.

393
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,340
Yeah, so we're fucked.

394
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,340
Yep.

395
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:25,780
So Alex gets to a first guest here on the 22nd and it's a Bilderberg expert.

396
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:29,940
I remember five, six, seven, eight years ago on the radio, I'd talk about the Bilderberg

397
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,820
group and get calls from listeners.

398
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,300
I heard that's a code word for terrorism.

399
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,300
It doesn't exist.

400
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,300
You're insane.

401
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,420
I heard on the news, insane people believe this exists.

402
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,940
It didn't exist.

403
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:50,620
Well, it does exist and now it's public thanks to the work of folks out there like Tony Gosling

404
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,360
of Bilderberg.org is about to join us.

405
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,100
So I'd never heard of this dude.

406
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,100
Tony Gosling?

407
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,100
Yeah.

408
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,740
I wanted to learn a little bit more about him because he's not the Bilderberg expert

409
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,780
that I'm used to Alex having on.

410
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,780
Wasn't he in the notebook?

411
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,780
It's his brother.

412
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,780
Oh, okay.

413
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:10,260
When later time Alex Jones is trying to look into a Bilderberg story, he pretty much always

414
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,380
talks to big Jim Tucker.

415
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:17,220
And then in second place, if Jim's not available or had died by then, Alex would talk to Daniel

416
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,300
Estelen.

417
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,220
Tony Gosling's not a super relevant name in the periods that I've listened to of Alex's

418
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,340
show.

419
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:28,380
Tony runs a website called Bilderberg.org and I will say that this site pretty quickly

420
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,380
deteriorates from being about the Bilderberg group at all.

421
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:36,560
If you scroll down his homepage, you'll soon find a picture of Jesus as Che Guevara, which

422
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,020
is on a shirt that he sells.

423
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,020
Not good.

424
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,300
And then a reprinting of the Ten Commandments and the Lord's Prayer.

425
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,300
Okay.

426
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,300
Okay.

427
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,900
It's weirdly religiously centered for what appears to be a site about the Bilderberg

428
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:51,900
group, which if I'm not mistaken and based on this interview that I'm hearing on Alex's

429
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,240
show is supposed to be a political conspiracy.

430
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:00,340
Things really fall apart when you get to the section titled, quote, My Spiritual Beliefs.

431
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,540
No.

432
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,400
This passage.

433
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,380
That should be on everybody's wall.

434
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,700
Things really fall apart when I say, here are my personal beliefs.

435
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,420
This passage stood out as not sounding great.

436
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:20,060
Quote, Many problems have been caused by some of the Jewish people's refusal to acknowledge

437
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,580
Jesus as the Messiah.

438
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,940
That does sound like the root cause of many problems.

439
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:29,120
Many Jews, for example, live in Old Testament Torah times, believing they're still God's

440
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,540
chosen people.

441
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:34,480
It seems clear to me that God cut off the Jewish hierarchy from his favor after they

442
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,540
pleaded successfully for the unjust death of his only son.

443
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,540
Why?

444
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,540
Why?

445
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,540
Where?

446
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,540
Where?

447
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,540
When?

448
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,540
Why?

449
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,540
In the Bible?

450
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,640
Do you mean the Bible where they wrote letters, the rest of the New Testament is writing letters

451
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,380
to Jews about Jesus being great?

452
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:57,180
There's a lot of conversation about who is or is not real Jews also on that site.

453
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,180
There we are.

454
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,500
It's a little convoluted and not good.

455
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,500
Okay.

456
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,540
The website's also just weird.

457
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:06,860
If you scroll down a little bit further, you find a list of Tony's 30 top movies.

458
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,860
The Life of Brian.

459
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,860
What did you just say to me?

460
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,860
The Life of Brian weirdly came in at number 24.

461
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,860
How can the Life of Brian be on there?

462
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,860
He likes to have fun.

463
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:19,380
You know this satire of every...

464
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:24,860
My personal beliefs, my 24th favorite movie eviscerates how stupid they are.

465
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,860
Great.

466
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,660
So after that, there's a section about how great Bill Hicks was as a comedian.

467
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,660
I'm not kidding.

468
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,660
I'm not kidding.

469
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,660
I don't...

470
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,660
There's a big section about Bill Hicks.

471
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,660
No!

472
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,020
What is wrong with the humanity?

473
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,700
It's a really poorly laid out and confusing website.

474
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,960
And I don't know if it would even be helpful, even if you did assume that he had evidence

475
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,960
of something.

476
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,100
Listen, religion is the center of all of our problems in this life.

477
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,660
This guy is my favorite comedian.

478
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,820
Anyways, here are my personal beliefs.

479
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,860
Number four or five on his list was They Live.

480
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,500
Oh boy.

481
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,860
Well that one actually tracks.

482
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,620
I didn't recognize a lot of the names of the movies and I'm guessing some of them were

483
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,620
not good.

484
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,820
It'd be funny if they were all...

485
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:09,620
It was like They Live, The Life of Brian, and then a bunch of weird 70s art.

486
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,380
Like Harold and Maude is up there.

487
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,340
They shoot horses, don't they?

488
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,820
Everything Lee Remick has ever been in.

489
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,820
Right.

490
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,820
Like all of that stuff.

491
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,540
Or like Lenny Riefenstahl.

492
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,700
Sure, sure.

493
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,700
This was...

494
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,700
I don't know.

495
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:31,060
I didn't read over everything, but it seems like this guy's a little bit unwell and he's

496
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:34,900
a bit defensive about his positions vis-à-vis Judaism.

497
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:39,140
He's defensive about his movies.

498
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:44,180
So welcome to Bilderberg.org Top 30 Movies.

499
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:49,060
Today... a lot of the stuff that he has to say about Bilderberg is all kind of the same

500
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:52,620
stuff you hear from just about any of these folks.

501
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:58,860
You know, just stray talk, powerful people are there, let's imagine what they're talking

502
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,860
about.

503
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,860
Sure.

504
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:04,480
Although this guy did have a little bit of a fun twist on it, and that he seemed to be

505
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:10,660
kind of like a bird watcher for Bilderberg members, because he seemed to get really excited

506
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,380
when he was talking about how one day, one day...

507
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,660
He saw one in the wild.

508
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,660
No.

509
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:20,340
One day during the Bilderberg conference, all the people, all the richies who were attending

510
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,620
the conference decided that they were going to go to the Palace of Versailles, and they

511
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:29,980
were going to just go tour around, and so he was like gawking at rich, powerful people.

512
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,340
He was really excited that David Rockefeller actually answered a couple questions from

513
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,740
people, and it didn't seem standoffish or mad.

514
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:40,060
It was like, I think you just enjoy this.

515
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,060
There's a really...

516
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:47,100
I don't see a conspiracy here, I think you like following around a powerful group of

517
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,100
people or something.

518
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:55,100
No, I feel like we're in a situation where the continuum is there's something, there's

519
00:22:55,100 --> 00:23:00,980
a very thin line between avid hater and fanboy.

520
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:05,340
There's a very thin line between oh, I hate the Bilderberg group, and I'm going to follow

521
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,020
them everywhere they go and hope to catch a glimpse of them.

522
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,900
He seemed like he was on that line.

523
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,900
Yeah.

524
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,060
He seemed to be doing it a little bit more than a lot of the other folks, like the Tuckers

525
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:20,180
or Estillans, that seemed just to be either insane or full of hate.

526
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,180
Yeah.

527
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:26,380
But yeah, this guy, I don't know, here's just a clip of...

528
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,980
In his own words, let's hear what he has to say.

529
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,900
An interesting character, Bernhard, because he's both before and after he started the

530
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:39,500
Bilderberg, had some really disastrous things happen to him, which throw a lot of doubt

531
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,500
over his integrity.

532
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:51,020
First of all, his membership before the US entered World War II of the SS, the German

533
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,020
SS.

534
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:56,580
He then left Germany afterwards and married into the Dutch royal family, but he was in

535
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,460
Hitler's feared SS during the war.

536
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:02,340
This is the guy that started the group off, and the irony is, of course, that they will

537
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:08,820
tell us that one of the reasons for the group is to stop the next or to stop any other possible

538
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,660
Hitler surfacing in the future.

539
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:14,020
Now I would have thought one of the worst people to start an organization dedicated

540
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,740
to that task was someone who'd been in Hitler's SS.

541
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:21,140
It is true that for a brief time before the war, Prince Bernhard was a member of the Reiter

542
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,100
SS, the mounted division of the SS.

543
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:29,180
This is definitely not cool, and I'm not making any kind of an excuse for it, but it's usually

544
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:34,300
a good idea when you're looking at a historical figure like this to judge them based on the

545
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:40,920
measure of a person's actions as opposed to a tiny, not a tiny detail, but a specific

546
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,820
individual detail.

547
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:47,140
Bernhard clearly did not support the Nazis in World War II, and he actively fought against

548
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:50,340
them when Hitler invaded the Netherlands in 1940.

549
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:54,660
His track record is fairly clear, and he was fighting Hitler's forces before the US even

550
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,660
was.

551
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,100
This is an instance of something that's a true enough fact that's being used to create

552
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,540
a dishonest image in the listener's head.

553
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:06,100
The goal is to portray that Bernhard is somebody who fought alongside the Nazis in the war,

554
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,620
and is someone who's a part of this elite division of Hitler's organization, and that's

555
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,000
just not true.

556
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,300
There's more complexity to this than that.

557
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:20,300
Yeah, that's got Soros's dad written all over it in that, like, fine!

558
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:27,140
I get what, yes, your fundamental basic fact is correct, and by leaving out literally everything

559
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:31,300
else you can support your narrative, but that's not the only fact.

560
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:38,180
Yeah, and probably Prince Bernhard's a little bit less of a sympathetic figure than 14-year-old

561
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:47,980
George Soros, inasmuch as he was older, and he was a member of the writing SS, but still,

562
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:53,540
the totality of his actions during the war speak to somebody who was not on the side

563
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,540
of Hitler.

564
00:25:54,540 --> 00:26:04,060
He's not on the side of the Nazis, and I think that at that point you can say, alright, this

565
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:10,120
was a blip on your, it's a stain on your history, but it's not something that should be deterministic

566
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,540
of your character.

567
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:16,460
And that's what this guy wants to present Bernhard as, because, you know, he hates the

568
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:21,860
Bilderberg group, and if one of the people who co-founded it can be just portrayed as,

569
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:25,140
you know, one of Hitler's higher-ups, then there you go.

570
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,140
Right.

571
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:33,220
No, it's one of the most annoying things, because you don't, like, I don't need help

572
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,660
being prejudiced against a prince.

573
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:39,900
Like I'm fine with that, I don't like royalty.

574
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:44,780
But you can't make me hate him based on bullshit, that's not fair.

575
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,780
Also I'd like to correct myself.

576
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,780
That's not fair.

577
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,420
His name is Bernhard, I kept saying Barnard.

578
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,660
I did hear Barnard, and I was like, ehhh.

579
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,660
I don't know why.

580
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:57,580
Yeah, no, I mean, I don't need help, I don't need help there, and you lying about him makes

581
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:00,540
me then have to defend him, which I don't want to do.

582
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,540
No.

583
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,780
I don't want to defend a prince, fuck royalty.

584
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:10,100
No, it makes you need to, like, be like, well hold on a second, and then secondarily it

585
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:15,680
makes me very wary of whatever information you're putting out.

586
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:20,700
Whatever information you have about the Bilderberg group seems kind of sketchy, if this is the

587
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,300
level of accusation you're making.

588
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:29,340
If you can't get a basic detail contextually right, then why would I believe the rest of

589
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,340
what you have to say?

590
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,340
Yeah.

591
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:35,500
Anyway, the rest of this is just, you know, standard Bilderberg conspiracy nonsense.

592
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,500
Sure.

593
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,500
Gossip.

594
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,500
Sure.

595
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,260
And bird watching of rich people.

596
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:43,500
You know, can't argue with a good bird watching.

597
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:49,460
So Alex gets back to calls, and this caller is sort of relevant to my interests, and that

598
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:55,600
is of course whether or not Alex was fighting the literal devil in 2003.

599
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,460
This gives us a little hint, maybe?

600
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,460
Wyatt Maryland.

601
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,460
Wyatt, you're on the air.

602
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,460
Go ahead, sir.

603
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,460
Good afternoon, Alex.

604
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,460
How you doing?

605
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,460
Good, good.

606
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:10,700
Boy, there's so much to talk about, and there's so little time, but all I can say is the demons

607
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:15,220
are loose, and they're out, and they're doing the work.

608
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:19,420
I mean, Alex doesn't have a direct response to that, but they're loose.

609
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,420
Demons are loose.

610
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,420
Demons are loose.

611
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,820
I don't know what happened, but demons got loose.

612
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,500
Who let the demons out?

613
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:31,640
We had, listen, we had them in a corral in northwestern Montana.

614
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,240
We had kept all the demons there.

615
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,920
That's how we had developed this great nation of ours, and somebody tripped, ruined the

616
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,220
summoning circle, and now the demons are loose.

617
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,500
There's just nothing to do.

618
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,840
Someone's gotta get a lasso.

619
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,220
We gotta drive in these here demons.

620
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,900
I think we need the regulators.

621
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:53,680
I think Nate Dogg and Warren G need to mount up R.I.P.

622
00:28:53,680 --> 00:29:00,820
I think that this is an indication of some of the conversation that is clearly just pretty

623
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:05,900
organic and natural on Alex's show at this time, talking about demons being loose and

624
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:11,460
what have you, but it's still kind of a nebulous picture for me.

625
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:18,820
I'm leaning more towards there being a real literalist religious vibe going on.

626
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:23,900
I'm leaning closer to that, but I also don't have merely the amount of information that

627
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:31,420
we do from the present that Alex legit thinks the shoot devil is there and he's pulling

628
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:35,580
the strings of the enemies.

629
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:39,820
This guy sounds like he definitely believes that the literal demons are loose.

630
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,820
This dude.

631
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,820
Yeah.

632
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,900
They're doing work.

633
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:48,520
You could still see that as a metaphor, or if you're Alex and you're responding to that,

634
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:55,060
you could see that as a metaphor for the demonic impulses of the elite are given free reign

635
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:58,980
now, no longer having to be corralled or moderated.

636
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,700
Yeah, who knows?

637
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:06,500
So Alex gets a lot of mileage out of people pretending that he's been right about so many

638
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,900
things, about so many things.

639
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,220
For 27 years.

640
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,540
He's righter than he is wrong, and he's not.

641
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:16,780
But one of the things that I thought was really fun about this next clip is he makes a bunch

642
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:22,900
of predictions about gun grabbing and stuff and everything he says is wrong.

643
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,900
Okay.

644
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:29,620
They're going to reauthorize Clinton's gun ban and they're going to expand it radically.

645
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,060
So they're going to add a semiautomatic shotgun ban.

646
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:37,580
That's the NRA telling you that they're going to sign S 22, which is Patriot act two in

647
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:43,320
the Senate, full of gun registration, shutting down the gun shows, national ballistics databases,

648
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:48,820
the most gun control, the most hardcore draconian stuff we've ever seen.

649
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:53,860
And the average conservative out there has no idea because the neo cons like rush Limbaugh,

650
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:58,220
Neil boards, Michael Savage, Sean Hannity will not tell them.

651
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,220
Wow.

652
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,220
He likes a lot of those people.

653
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,220
Now.

654
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,220
Yeah.

655
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,220
Loves them.

656
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,220
All those predictions are wrong.

657
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,220
I was, I was trying to keep track of him.

658
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:09,140
I wrote, Nope, Nope, Nope.

659
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,140
And also Nope.

660
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,140
Nope.

661
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,140
None of those happened.

662
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,140
Yes, that is true.

663
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,860
Um, so yeah, I mean, he's right.

664
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,860
Most of the time.

665
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,860
Sure.

666
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:23,580
Anyway, this next clip, Alex goes back to calls and this dude, I tried to trace this

667
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,580
down.

668
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:29,580
I got very little on this, but this, this was, I enjoyed this is going to be a big swing.

669
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,580
Hmm.

670
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,580
Yeah.

671
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,580
Sure.

672
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,580
Okay.

673
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,580
Tom and Texas.

674
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,580
You're on the air.

675
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,580
Go ahead, sir.

676
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,580
Yeah.

677
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,580
You're on the air.

678
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,580
Go ahead.

679
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,580
Yes, sir.

680
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:47,380
I, I first informed, uh, Tex Mars in, uh, 1988 about the, uh, the church, the hidden

681
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:54,460
church over there on highway six, uh, about, uh, as an area and as a moment, I was in work

682
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,700
with you all movies world, sir, I really don't understand what you're saying or have to give

683
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,700
us some background.

684
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:05,900
I do not understand this and I want to know, tell me about the hidden church on route six.

685
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,140
Well, thankfully Alex does ask for clarification and here it comes.

686
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:15,260
Okay, the background is, uh, I went to this church that we moved pews out of and the old

687
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:18,220
man walked out cussing like a sailor cause we got there late.

688
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,460
He said, you realize who's church this is?

689
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,460
I said, no.

690
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:25,900
He said, this is George Bush's church, but we walked in and had a big swatch to go hanging

691
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:33,000
down and up above the pulpit and I said, well, okay, well tell me all about, he has the Christian

692
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,980
symbol up there, you said, and it's, and he showed me all the pictures in the offices

693
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,500
of the Bush family.

694
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:45,140
So about, I guess two weeks later, I went and told Tex Mars about it at a convention

695
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,480
at the hobby airport.

696
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,420
So first of all, this dude worked for a moving company and he was called to show up at a

697
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:54,980
backwards hidden church to remove pews, but somehow the only person there hadn't called

698
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,580
them to move the furniture and was confused that they were there.

699
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,580
Correct.

700
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,580
This is a little fishy.

701
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,580
No.

702
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,100
My second issue is that this was in 1988.

703
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:06,380
So at this point, George H.W. Bush was coming to the end of his second term as vice president

704
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,020
and was about to win the 1988 election for president.

705
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:13,820
He still flew back to Texas every Sunday to go to the hidden church on Route 6, everybody

706
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,820
knows that.

707
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:19,100
George W. Bush hadn't even become Texas governor yet and honestly, he hadn't even bought the

708
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,100
Texas Rangers at this point.

709
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:24,420
I don't see how the either, it would be in either of their interests to be running a

710
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:28,180
secret Nazi church in the middle of Texas when they were spending most of their time

711
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:31,780
at this point in DC and campaigning.

712
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:35,500
I am the vice president of the United States.

713
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,620
And have been for years.

714
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:43,420
One of the most looked at, observed, and known where a person is at all times.

715
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,420
People you can be.

716
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,220
Almost like there's a schedule that's public.

717
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,620
That's public.

718
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,480
Every day.

719
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:54,460
But on Sundays, flies back to Texas, heads to the hidden Nazi church.

720
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,380
No one knows about it.

721
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:00,740
Except for this guy, the U-Haul mover who accidentally showed up there or something.

722
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:04,180
And there are hidden pictures of the, okay, okay.

723
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:10,820
So you're telling me, you're telling me that this moving company shows up, the guy is cussing

724
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:13,300
like a sailor, says, do you know whose church this is?

725
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,760
This is the Bush's church.

726
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:20,160
And then that aggressive attitude wipes away and he's like, come on back into the office.

727
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,900
Let me show you George Bush and the Nazis.

728
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:26,540
And no one will ever find these pictures despite the fact that this guy seems willing to show

729
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,900
them to literally anybody who walks in.

730
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,900
Yeah, yeah.

731
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,420
He seems, seems to be real neighborly.

732
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:38,380
Hey, hey, this is the hidden church on route six.

733
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,380
Come on in.

734
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,500
Let me show you the vice president's Nazi memorabilia.

735
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:46,980
Well, you know, I work for George H.W. Bush and he specifically told me when he left that

736
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:50,420
while I was watching over the place, I was to tell everybody.

737
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,960
Let everybody know.

738
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,940
Be sure you show the pictures of me and my family.

739
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,100
Yes, I want this information getting out.

740
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,340
That's why I go to this hidden church.

741
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,460
Ridiculous.

742
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:07,660
Also, Tex Mars is a extreme anti-Semite.

743
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:11,400
So yeah, it's not good that this guy felt like, hey, first person I got to get this

744
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,400
information to.

745
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,400
Yeah.

746
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,400
Yeah.

747
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,400
Not good.

748
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,400
No.

749
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,400
So Alex wants to know where this church is.

750
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,400
Yes.

751
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,400
Because that is an important question.

752
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,400
Now, where is this church, sir?

753
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,260
That was the problem.

754
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:28,700
Now, when I told Tex Mars, he wrote about me in his book, Hidden Days of the Rainbow.

755
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,020
I'm the one that informed him about it.

756
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,180
He didn't know nothing about it.

757
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,820
And he found it to be true.

758
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,820
Where is this church, sir?

759
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,820
Okay.

760
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,820
It was on Highway 6.

761
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,820
Best I can remember.

762
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,820
This is in 88.

763
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,820
I'll have to do some more investigation.

764
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,820
Outside where?

765
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,820
Right outside.

766
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:49,340
It's close to, I'd say going out past Sugar Land.

767
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,340
Outside Houston.

768
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,340
Right.

769
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,340
It's on the east side of Houston.

770
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,620
I mean, the west side of Houston.

771
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:59,860
Look, man, if you find the vice president's Nazi church, you will forget.

772
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:02,860
Just know where the vice president's Nazi church is.

773
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,780
You will drive people by.

774
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,780
It's pretty big.

775
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,780
Yeah.

776
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,780
It's a pretty big thing.

777
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,460
No, I would find ways.

778
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:14,440
I would be like, hey, look, the main highway has been torn down.

779
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,820
We're going to have to take the long way through Highway 6.

780
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:24,300
Oh, by the way, I met George Bush's Nazi pastor and he's got pictures of George Bush with

781
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,300
the Nazi bullshit.

782
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:29,900
I find it difficult to believe that if you did find something like this, you wouldn't

783
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,100
go back yourself.

784
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,100
All the time.

785
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,100
Not all the time.

786
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,100
Not all the time.

787
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:37,100
But at least you'd go back and be like, did I really see what I thought I saw?

788
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,100
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

789
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,420
No, this is Brigadoon.

790
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,420
It's outrageous.

791
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,420
Yeah.

792
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:47,100
So anyway, this church, I want to ask you how you're picturing this.

793
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,180
How big is it?

794
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,440
What are you imagining?

795
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,740
Give me some physical attributes that you're-

796
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:57,780
All right, I see it seating maybe 60 to 80 people.

797
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,780
There are about-

798
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,260
So it's kind of a smaller congregation.

799
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,900
Kind of a smaller congregation.

800
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:05,260
There's two rows of pews on either side with a walkway there.

801
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:11,940
There's a pulpit and directly behind it hanging is a, let's call it 20 foot tall Nazi flag

802
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,460
based on his description.

803
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:17,220
Do you think that it's a place that's in good repair?

804
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,660
Do you think it's something that's dilapidated?

805
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,660
What are your feelings on this?

806
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:26,540
I think it has to have that feel of being absurdly clean for the area that it's in.

807
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:32,740
Like the walls are painted absurdly white, almost as if they're immune to the nature

808
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,740
around them.

809
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:37,380
So it's like an OR, like an operating room in the middle of a swamp.

810
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,580
Yes, absolutely.

811
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,580
Okay.

812
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,740
That is an interesting picture and I think that's probably about what I thought.

813
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,740
We're both wrong.

814
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,740
Okay.

815
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,340
How many people would you say the church would see?

816
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,340
7,000.

817
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:52,260
Probably at least 800 at the least.

818
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,260
That's a lot.

819
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,260
It's real organized.

820
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,260
That's a lot of people who know George Bush is a Nazi.

821
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:02,260
I mean, the whole family was in there, they had the Bushes, the kids, the whole nine yards

822
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,260
in there.

823
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:06,940
He says, I said, well, I can't believe this is Bushes.

824
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:11,180
He said, man, this is the God, God, this is the true church of God here.

825
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:13,460
And he said it was a branch from the Abyscapelian.

826
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:19,780
I do remember him saying that, a branch away from the Abyscapelian.

827
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:24,020
Sir, I appreciate your call, Tom, appreciate it.

828
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:28,060
But look, that is not how I know the global is to operate.

829
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:32,140
It's an armored fortress at the Skull and Bones tomb and that kind of stuff is in there.

830
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,140
That's confirmed.

831
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:38,180
It's guarded at Bohemian Grove and there is that type of stuff.

832
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,420
I don't know that story, sir.

833
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:45,580
I really, I don't like to speculate on, so, you know, I'm not saying you're a liar.

834
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,020
It just, it just doesn't, doesn't fit.

835
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,900
It fits with some stuff but not in other areas.

836
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,620
I'm so proud of Alex.

837
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:57,220
That's one of the few points that I've ever heard him be like, I can't accept this.

838
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,140
Yeah, that is, that is intense.

839
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,140
Yeah.

840
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:03,940
How great would it be to be like, I'm on the phone with the person who found George W. Bush's

841
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,940
Nazi church.

842
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,980
And he's like, I can't make this fit.

843
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:08,980
This is no good.

844
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,980
No, sir.

845
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:10,980
Look, this just doesn't match.

846
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:11,980
Yeah.

847
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:12,980
Sorry.

848
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:15,060
I'm not calling you a liar, but I don't know about this.

849
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,060
Yeah.

850
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:20,380
That's, that's a, that is a level of pushback I rarely see from him.

851
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,380
That's true.

852
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:26,620
But I mean, at the same time, his pushback is not based around like, that's ridiculous

853
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:32,360
so much as it is like, okay, I get you think there's a Nazi base on the moon, but it's

854
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,360
on Mars.

855
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,360
Duh.

856
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,900
I can't accept this Nazi base on the moon.

857
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,520
Whatever my Nazi base is on Mars, man.

858
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,780
I have to actually push back on what you're saying because I think that that's not fair.

859
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:47,940
I think that what Alex is saying, the reason that he's, he's pushing back on this guy is

860
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:53,700
because he's saying there are little Nazi enclaves and, and, and like worship centers

861
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,700
or whatever.

862
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,700
Yeah, of course.

863
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,700
But they're heavily armed.

864
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,700
Yes.

865
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:01,420
That's like, you, you can't get into the skull and bones area where there's the big Nazi

866
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,420
flag.

867
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,420
Right.

868
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,860
There's not going to be one out in the middle of like at this church that you get welcomed

869
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,860
into.

870
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:11,380
And it's not, it's not that it's like, okay, it's on the moon or on Mars.

871
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:14,820
It's the context surrounding this doesn't make sense.

872
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,820
I understand.

873
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:19,780
This would not be that easy to accidentally stumble into.

874
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,760
I broke into Bohemian Grove.

875
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,480
That's how I know their things.

876
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,980
You didn't break into this church.

877
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:31,060
No, you were welcomed in by a, and that would never happen, a surprisingly neighborly Nazi.

878
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,060
Right.

879
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:37,500
Because his narratives require that it's hard to find these secrets.

880
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,500
True.

881
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,500
True.

882
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,500
And so that's why he's pushing back.

883
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:44,820
But I still think that it's at least, I mean, functionally, it serves the same purpose as

884
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,140
saying that this is ridiculous.

885
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,140
Sure.

886
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,360
No, that's, that's definitely true.

887
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,360
That's definitely true.

888
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:54,520
And he, I mean, I assume it would feel like a bit of a personal attack on his manhood

889
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:58,840
if you just got to get secrets by walking into places.

890
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:02,180
And then potentially bigger scoop than Bohemian Grove.

891
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,180
Exactly.

892
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,980
Just by accidentally showing up with a U-Haul truck.

893
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:09,780
I think it would just be so much easier to be like, really seats 800, huh?

894
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,780
Wow.

895
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:17,100
So there's, there's a, what, 768 people who know that the entire Bush family is Nazis?

896
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,100
No, no, no.

897
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,100
Here's what you don't know.

898
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,420
There's 800 Bush family members.

899
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:24,300
Now that might as well be your, your angle on it.

900
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,300
Sure.

901
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,860
It's the only Bush church there's ever been.

902
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,860
Yeah.

903
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:32,860
So here's, here's our last clip from the 22nd.

904
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:38,180
Alex is talking about the situation in Iraq, and he's saying that, about to confiscate

905
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,660
weapons from people.

906
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:43,740
Allies to begin seizing weapons from most Iraqis.

907
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:47,420
Iraqi citizens will be required to turn over automatic weapons and heavy weapons under

908
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:51,060
a proclamation that allied authorities plan to issue this week.

909
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:54,900
Allied officials of the day, the aim of the proclamation is to help stabilize Iraq by

910
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:59,180
confiscating a huge supply of AK-47 machine guns, buck repelled grenades, and other weapons

911
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:02,540
that are used by criminal gangs, paramilitary groups, and remnants of the Saddam Hussein's

912
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,540
government.

913
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:08,180
Well, the remnants of Saddam Hussein's government, we've got the names, the Ba'ath Party's being

914
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,680
put back into control.

915
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:17,060
So Alex still thinks on the 22nd of May that the Ba'ath Party is being put back into power

916
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,540
and it's all a CIA operation.

917
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:23,140
Isn't he reading about how they're confiscating the Ba'ath Party's weapons?

918
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:31,300
Well, I mean, I think that, I have to assume that he just thinks that that's window dressing

919
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,300
or cover or something.

920
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

921
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,860
That way people won't suspect that the Ba'ath Party is still running things.

922
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:37,860
Right, right.

923
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,860
Yeah, yeah.

924
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:43,260
So I still think that we have not reached a point where this is interesting.

925
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:49,300
It's still sort of rising, it's crescendoing reality, and Alex just...

926
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,300
They're on a collision course.

927
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,300
Head on.

928
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,300
Head on collision.

929
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,820
Two trains traveling directly at each other.

930
00:42:54,820 --> 00:43:01,700
And I'm very interested to see how that, how Alex tries to veer around that, that looming

931
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,700
accident.

932
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:07,340
It does have the feel of two trains riding straight towards each other and one train

933
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:13,220
is like, ooh, I can't hit reality, so I'm going to turn off, and then it hits a bus.

934
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:14,720
You're like, way to go.

935
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:21,780
So a large portion of this episode on the 23rd is Alex talking to this Belgian doctor,

936
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:22,780
Dr. Van Martyr.

937
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:23,780
Okay.

938
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:24,780
Mortyr?

939
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:25,780
Martyr?

940
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:26,780
I'm not entirely sure.

941
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:27,780
That's a good name.

942
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:32,100
He's a dude who witnessed crimes being committed by our military against Iraqi civilians, and

943
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:37,860
there's talk of bringing charges against military leaders in foreign courts.

944
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:38,860
Yeah.

945
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:39,860
That would be nice.

946
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,820
I have little problem with this interview as a whole.

947
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:48,420
I think that this guy is bringing up some fine points, but also it's not a very good

948
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,420
interview.

949
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:55,460
I think I don't think that Alex really gets to too many of the more important issues.

950
00:43:55,460 --> 00:44:00,540
It seems like he's doing a bit of grandstanding and what have you, and I just think that this

951
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:04,620
subject matter is covered better by almost anybody else.

952
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:11,140
Even in 2003, there were much better commentators that you could find discussing human rights

953
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:16,660
abuses on the part of our military in Iraq, but at the same time, I'm not going to sit

954
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:23,440
and nitpick, because it's mostly this dude talking, and his perspective is like, he saw

955
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,540
some US soldiers shooting at an ambulance, and like, yeah, that sucks.

956
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,260
Yeah, that's a war crime.

957
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:36,700
So would you say that this interview is Alex letting somebody give legitimate criticisms

958
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:43,740
of the US military in order for him to be like, see, the military and the government

959
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:47,740
is all evil, despite not actually giving a shit about the war crimes, and just kind of

960
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:49,860
exploiting that the government is evil?

961
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:54,720
Somewhat, and then also using it to translate into, like, they're going to start a police

962
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,720
state here.

963
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:56,720
Sure, sure.

964
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:03,980
And so I don't think that his use of this stuff is great, but I also think, like...

965
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:06,120
Yeah, the US commits war crimes.

966
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,120
We got it.

967
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,120
Yeah, it's...

968
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,580
We should do something about it now, soon.

969
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:10,580
It's hard to lose...

970
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:12,120
In 2003.

971
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,440
It's really weird to me.

972
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:21,260
It's really weird to remember 2003 and hear that Alex was having a Belgian doctor on to

973
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,820
reveal US war crimes and was not...

974
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:28,580
Like, because I remember how bloodthirsty everybody was.

975
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:31,700
Everybody was so fucking bloodthirsty.

976
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:36,500
If you went on TV and said like, hey, the American government is committing war crimes,

977
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:41,420
there would be another talking head being like, that's the cost of war, you know?

978
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:45,820
And people would agree, yes, sometimes you have to commit war crimes.

979
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:52,980
To fucking have to live in a world where unfortunately, despite his exploitative nature, Alex was

980
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:59,180
one of the few people putting on an agreement fest about the US committing war crimes is

981
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:00,180
wild.

982
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:01,180
Yeah, yeah.

983
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:02,180
It is.

984
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,180
Yeah, it is.

985
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:04,180
Sorry, I just needed to observe that.

986
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:08,740
That just feels like really strange to live in both the present and the past at the same

987
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:09,740
time.

988
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:14,140
And it's worth pointing out, I don't think it's worth discussing this interview like

989
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:20,220
actual clips of it, but it is worth bringing up that that is a reality.

990
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:28,060
And again, I think you can say hooray to an extent to him for that.

991
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:33,260
But there's still other voices that exist that were talking about these things, and

992
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:39,060
they weren't doing things like the other things that Alex is doing.

993
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:43,860
And one of those things is hanging out with fucking shitheads and talking about Bilderberg.

994
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:44,860
Yeah.

995
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:49,740
I mean, just in the context of that, it is kind of something that I think about a lot

996
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:57,420
just because that's part of how Alex got to where he got to, is that there were shit tons

997
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:04,720
of war crimes going on, and because this is correct, you are sucked into the rest of his

998
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:11,160
bullshit until he just gets rid of even any pretense of giving a shit about war crimes,

999
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:15,680
and then you're trapped in this place of, neither do I, you know?

1000
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,680
It's weird.

1001
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,820
Yeah, it is weird.

1002
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:22,160
And the things that he cares about more aren't those things.

1003
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,160
They aren't...

1004
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,160
Exactly.

1005
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,540
They aren't issues that he cares about for the sake of them.

1006
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:29,860
He cares about them as a means.

1007
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:30,860
Yeah.

1008
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:35,920
And it's an important thing to point out that one of the big reasons that we are here where

1009
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:43,300
propagandists can destroy everything is that cyclical nature between a corrupt war crime

1010
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:49,120
committing government and a propaganda outlet who's creating that like, yeah, you can't

1011
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:53,820
trust these war crime committing people for good reasons until it spirals out of control,

1012
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:56,980
and now you can't trust anybody or anything.

1013
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,160
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1014
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,700
I got lost on a tangent there.

1015
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:01,700
Apologies.

1016
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:02,700
Apologies.

1017
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:03,700
No worries.

1018
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:06,900
So one of the things that Alex does care more about, one of the things that's really consistent,

1019
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,140
like I said, is that Bilderberg shit.

1020
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:16,580
And so he had that guy, Tony Gosling, on the 22nd talk about Bilderberg, and if you go

1021
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:19,180
check out his website, he has some iffy opinions.

1022
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:22,580
I would like Alex to put his top 30 movies on the Info Wars website.

1023
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:23,580
I don't.

1024
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:24,580
Okay.

1025
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:25,940
I think it would all just be...

1026
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:28,140
Oblivion 1 through 30.

1027
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:29,140
Yeah.

1028
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:31,940
Yeah, Life's a Movie, man.

1029
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:35,540
So he has another expert on the 23rd, and that's big Jim Tucker, baby.

1030
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:42,900
Well, I spent 20 years with the establishment press, with Washington Daily News, Akron,

1031
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:49,820
Beacon, Journal, Richmond Times, This Statch, other newspapers, until 1975 when I was being

1032
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:55,300
interviewed by Willis Carter at Liberty Lobby for the position of editor of a newspaper

1033
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:58,180
he was getting ready to create called The Spotlight.

1034
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:02,220
He asked me what I thought about Bilderberg, and I said, who are they, and he gave me a

1035
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:03,220
brief description.

1036
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,220
I said, that's impossible.

1037
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:06,740
I've been with newspapers all my life.

1038
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:09,140
Such a group could not exist without me knowing.

1039
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:11,960
Willis Cardo is a Nazi and white supremacist.

1040
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:16,780
The Spectator was a paper whose editorial position was anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial.

1041
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:19,500
Jim Tucker was the editor of that paper.

1042
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:23,240
In case you've forgotten since we talked about him in our Endgame coverage, here's one of

1043
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,340
Willis Cardo's famous quotes.

1044
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:31,060
Quote, if Satan himself, with all of his superhuman genius and diabolical ingenuity at his command,

1045
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:35,900
had tried to create a permanent disintegration and force for the destruction of the nations,

1046
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:39,780
he could have done no better than invent the Jews.

1047
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:44,660
Describing his motivation to start The Spotlight, the ADL says in a bio of Cardo, quote, Cardo's

1048
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:48,640
chief aim was always to mobilize opinion against Jews.

1049
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,220
Liberty Lobby was his chief instrument to bridge right-wing constituencies.

1050
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:57,780
Hard-right or paramilitary libertarians, conspiratorial anti-communists, racists by inflaming their

1051
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:02,980
anti-government and nativist fears and identifying Jews as the country's chief threat.

1052
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:06,900
Willis Cardo is a bigot who wanted to sway public opinion against Jews with his media

1053
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:07,900
entities.

1054
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:12,940
And Jim Tucker worked for his big media entity from its beginning in 1975 until they folded

1055
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:14,720
in 2001.

1056
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,020
Fuck him and fuck whatever he has to say about Bilderberg.

1057
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:23,100
It's even more insulting that he didn't know about them until Willis Cardo told him about

1058
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:24,100
them.

1059
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,100
God damn.

1060
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:26,100
Yeah.

1061
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:27,220
One of the worst.

1062
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:28,220
Fuck Jim Tucker.

1063
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:34,140
Yeah, it makes you want to invent a bow and arrow that can shoot arrows into the past.

1064
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:37,460
One of the things that's really funny to me though is like, Alex is like, oh yeah, Jim

1065
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:40,940
Tucker, you know, you climb fences and get in there.

1066
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:42,220
He's a real intrepid journalist.

1067
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:47,460
And then like you look at the videos of Jim Tucker and he's always drunk and smoking at

1068
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:48,460
cigarettes.

1069
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:52,660
I was going to say, yeah, this is not a man, he's the guy who was wearing the hat all the

1070
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:53,660
time too.

1071
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:59,740
I was like, that is not a man who can jump a fence without severely injuring himself.

1072
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:04,180
He seems like he's exhausted reading a paper.

1073
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:06,820
Or at the very least continuing to breathe.

1074
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:07,820
Yeah.

1075
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:12,940
So anyway, Alex talks to Jim Tucker and it's all just the same shit except without the

1076
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:16,980
excitement at seeing David Rockefeller, the Tony Gosling guy.

1077
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:18,740
We don't have the fanboy moment.

1078
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:23,140
But one of the things that I think is worth pointing out about both of these interviews

1079
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:30,860
is that Jim Tucker is somebody who I don't know and I don't care what his personal positions

1080
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:31,860
are.

1081
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:39,540
He was the editor of a fucking white supremacist Holocaust denial paper for 25 years.

1082
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:43,780
And Tony Gosling has a lot of questions about who is or is not Jewish and thinks a lot of

1083
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:47,640
the problems in the world come from Jews not accepting Jesus as the Messiah.

1084
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,060
Seems like it.

1085
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:52,380
You wouldn't know that from listening to their interviews.

1086
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:53,740
You wouldn't know that.

1087
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:59,520
You would think that these guys are concerned about politics and really powerful people

1088
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,240
getting together and talking behind closed doors.

1089
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:07,980
You would think that, hey, these are just guys who have a political position that maybe

1090
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:12,160
is anathema with what the media wants to report.

1091
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:17,260
You wouldn't know that maybe a lot of antisemitism is what drives.

1092
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:18,260
Yeah.

1093
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:26,180
You know, a lot of people don't sympathize with Nazis as much.

1094
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:31,020
But what you got to understand is you used to be able to just tell people that you hated

1095
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:32,780
the Jews all the time.

1096
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:37,260
And now you have to hide behind all of these things, you know, like that's hard.

1097
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:39,520
Let's just think about the Nazis for a second.

1098
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:45,960
Now they can't even say openly on the radio that everyone should kill the Jews because

1099
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,060
it's their fault.

1100
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:48,060
It's brutal.

1101
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:49,060
Poor Willis.

1102
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:50,060
Poor Willis.

1103
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:54,580
Anyway, we go to the 27th because most of this show is just that interview with Jim

1104
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:58,060
Tucker and then the interview with the Belgian doctor.

1105
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:06,420
And like I said, the discussion of mistreatment of Iraqis and all that is fine and it's good.

1106
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:11,500
It's something that there was probably, I don't even know if probably is the right word,

1107
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:18,020
I would say definitely, there should have been more space for in public conversation.

1108
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:24,920
But one of the reasons that I find it kind of not that interesting or not that relevant

1109
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:31,000
to give Alex too much of a pat on the head about it is he takes these stories and he

1110
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:37,380
discusses or reads headlines about mistreatment of people in Iraq, the civilians, and then

1111
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,740
he just makes it about himself and the United States.

1112
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:41,740
Naturally.

1113
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:45,540
This is so horrible and it's only going to get worse.

1114
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:53,500
And MSNBC reported before the war plans for reeducation centers.

1115
00:53:53,500 --> 00:54:01,380
Marine centers, movie screens, blaring propaganda, machine gun nests, everything.

1116
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,980
This is so embarrassing.

1117
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:08,820
But again, Europe controls America, is using us as the bad cop right now, they own our

1118
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:12,380
full reserve, they've ordered the dollar to be imploded.

1119
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:18,180
So again, none of that came to pass here as he's suggesting.

1120
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:23,300
He's covering here, this is on the 27th now, we've jumped to that Tuesday, and he's covering

1121
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:29,780
conversation about Guantanamo, about the possibility of military tribunals taking place there.

1122
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:36,100
And now he's saying that they had plans before the war for here in America to have these

1123
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:39,860
detention centers and machine gun nests.

1124
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:48,340
It's all the conversation about the wrongs of the war exist in order to facilitate his

1125
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:51,860
narratives about his fears about what's going to happen here.

1126
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,780
It's not on its own merits.

1127
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:59,660
The people there, their pain and what's being done isn't wrong because it's wrong.

1128
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:01,780
And I have a difficulty with that.

1129
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:02,780
Yeah.

1130
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:05,200
I mean, you know, it's tough.

1131
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:13,080
The good thing is that, if I recall correctly, in 2008, Obama fulfilled his campaign promise

1132
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,260
to close Guantanamo Bay, right?

1133
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:18,820
That was like one of the first things he did.

1134
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:21,980
But Dan, I'm...

1135
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:27,620
So Alex goes to calls, and one of the things that he's been pretty upset about is seat

1136
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:31,540
belt checks.

1137
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:36,060
I really, really don't know.

1138
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:41,940
He's not a fan of click it or tick it.

1139
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:50,660
The devil with all of his might is arrayed against us, and I can't stand a $70 ticket.

1140
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:56,700
So he's talking here, another instance of him being totally right about his predictions

1141
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:57,700
of what would...

1142
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:59,140
So the seat belt checks.

1143
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:00,140
Yes.

1144
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:01,140
It's going to get out of control.

1145
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:02,140
It's going to get out of control.

1146
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:03,140
Okay.

1147
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:04,140
It was, we then learned the name of it.

1148
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:10,160
It was the National Seat Belt Use Initiative funded by Clinton to the tune of over $4 billion

1149
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,620
a year.

1150
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:15,620
Started at 2.4, and then it phased in over to $4 billion a year.

1151
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:17,220
Bush is funding it.

1152
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:23,840
It's going to build internal checkpoints that will also serve as toll booths to fund it.

1153
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,140
It will be the equivalent of airport screening.

1154
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:27,140
You'll be harassed.

1155
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:28,260
You'll be searched.

1156
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:29,940
That's why they don't care if you refuse to fly.

1157
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:36,340
You're going to go through it at the checkpoints, and it says, citizens will wear gray uniforms,

1158
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:38,380
part three of the four-part plan.

1159
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:40,440
Citizens will wear gray uniforms.

1160
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,660
That will be a national draft, compulsory draft.

1161
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:44,900
You will have to serve in Homeland Security.

1162
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:47,420
It will be high school students to be able to graduate.

1163
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:49,660
They will be searching you at checkpoints.

1164
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:54,580
The Philadelphia Inquirer reported last year that the kids are training with M-16s.

1165
00:56:54,580 --> 00:57:00,620
They're training in warrant service, checkpoints, fugitive apprehension, building clearing.

1166
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:07,740
It is going to be throngs of power-tripping citizens with submachine guns.

1167
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:08,740
It's a nightmare world, sir.

1168
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:09,740
How does it sound to you?

1169
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:10,740
I don't know.

1170
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:11,740
I don't think this happened.

1171
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:21,100
But, you know, one of the things that's wild is, like, you go back to 2003, and the world

1172
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:28,500
was so, like, topsy-turvy because of the aftermath of 9-11 and the Iraq war that I think a lot

1173
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:32,420
of people probably could hear something like that and be like, fuck, I don't know.

1174
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:33,420
Maybe.

1175
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:37,900
I don't know, I mean, the only thing that, like, the main argument I would have against

1176
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:42,980
that is just, like, that seems like biting off more than the government can chew, you

1177
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:43,980
know?

1178
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:47,340
Like, there's not the infrastructure in place to get everybody to wear gray uniforms.

1179
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:50,820
That's going to take a monumental effort of manufacturing.

1180
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:54,860
I think he was talking about the conscripted youths wearing gray uniforms.

1181
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:55,860
All right.

1182
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:59,980
Well, still, you've got to outfit all these kids with submachine guns.

1183
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:00,980
That's going to be noticed.

1184
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:01,980
Yeah.

1185
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:08,020
The gun manufacturers and the gun sellers are all used to exploiting fears about the

1186
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:11,700
people having too many, you know, like, I don't think it's going to happen.

1187
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:12,700
No.

1188
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:18,220
But, I mean, the kernels of some of this stuff is stuff that I remember, like, not sounding

1189
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:19,220
that crazy.

1190
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:23,660
The national draft, you could totally, yeah, the national draft, you totally, I was scared.

1191
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:29,220
I remember not insane people having that conversation about, like, is there a possibility that a

1192
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:33,580
draft may come back because of the world circumstances?

1193
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:34,580
Totally.

1194
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:40,700
And so I think you can take that level of, like, okay, that's not that nuts, and then

1195
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:48,100
attach all this nuts stuff on it and get someone to, I don't know, accept the nuts stuff because

1196
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:49,100
of the...

1197
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:54,140
Yeah, if I can buy something that is ostensibly nuts, which is the reinstatement of the draft,

1198
00:58:54,140 --> 00:59:00,180
then it's not that much bigger of a step to assume that there will be gray-clad children

1199
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:02,660
with submachine guns patrolling my neighborhood.

1200
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:03,660
Yeah.

1201
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:04,660
All of this because of seat belts?

1202
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:05,660
Sure.

1203
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:06,660
Okay.

1204
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:11,060
So another thing that Alex talks about a bit is there's a mad cow situation in Canada,

1205
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:17,420
and the Canadian beef market is taking a hit because of, there's at least a few cases of

1206
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:20,100
mad cow have been discovered and there's a fear of an outbreak.

1207
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:21,100
Yes.

1208
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:28,060
And Alex is complaining a bunch about how you need to, you can't be feeding animals

1209
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:31,600
other animals, dead animals, especially sick animals.

1210
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:35,780
You can't be feeding herbivores animal products and stuff like that.

1211
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,360
And fine, I agree.

1212
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:40,860
But I don't know what the answer is other than regulation.

1213
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:44,260
Well, we can't do regulation.

1214
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:45,260
It's nuts.

1215
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:50,080
He just complains about how people can't be allowed to do these things.

1216
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:53,700
How do you deal with this from a functional standpoint?

1217
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:56,860
He never brings up a solution other than people shouldn't do it.

1218
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:58,820
It's the free market system.

1219
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:04,860
If everybody wakes up, if he's got a 90% wake up rate, then the free market will, I assume,

1220
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:09,000
account for the fact that people know that these businesses shouldn't be doing that.

1221
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,580
So all of these people won't patronize these businesses.

1222
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:14,020
Well, it'll be too late because they'll have mad cow.

1223
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:15,580
They will have mad cow by then.

1224
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:16,640
That is unfortunate.

1225
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:17,640
That is unfortunate.

1226
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:18,640
Yeah.

1227
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,980
I think regulation might be the only way to really...

1228
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:21,980
Boy, it could work.

1229
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:22,980
Yeah.

1230
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:23,980
Anyway, I thought that was really stupid.

1231
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:24,980
Very.

1232
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:28,380
Alex has a call from a guy and he says Jesus a couple times.

1233
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:31,500
Like just like, oh, Jesus Christ, you know, like...

1234
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:32,500
Oh, as an epithet.

1235
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,500
No.

1236
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:34,900
Well, sort of as an exclamation.

1237
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:36,020
Gotcha.

1238
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:38,020
Alex ends the call.

1239
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:39,020
And this is...

1240
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:40,140
Because he's taken to the Lord's name in vain?

1241
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:44,100
Well, not because of that, but it's definitely what's on his mind.

1242
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:45,900
John, great to hear from you.

1243
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:48,100
I appreciate the call, sir.

1244
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:49,540
Great points from the United Kingdom.

1245
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:53,060
Please, though, I'm a Christian and we're on a many Christian stations.

1246
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:55,100
I know we have a worldly audience.

1247
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:59,540
Be very careful about using the Lord's name in vain because I don't want repercussions

1248
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:02,800
of that, not from stations, but from God.

1249
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:07,740
So I'm not mad at you, John, but be careful about, you know, being like the rest of the

1250
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:08,740
world.

1251
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:09,740
I'm not trying to chastise you.

1252
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:10,740
I just...

1253
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:11,740
Please, folks.

1254
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:12,740
We have a lot of homeschoolers listening as well.

1255
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:13,740
No!

1256
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:14,740
And...

1257
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:15,740
What?

1258
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:16,740
And not...

1259
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:18,220
What did you just say?

1260
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:19,900
And not use the Lord's name in vain.

1261
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:22,820
I don't want to divert people off, but that's an important point.

1262
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:24,340
That is an important point.

1263
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:25,340
Wow.

1264
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:27,340
Cut to 2021.

1265
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:31,780
And Jesus says, you gotta buy my products!

1266
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:33,060
I gotta trick Dick.

1267
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:34,060
Yep.

1268
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:35,060
Yep.

1269
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:36,860
Oh, boy.

1270
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:39,860
What a fucking ridiculous thing to say.

1271
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:44,580
I worry about God's vengeance when a caller says Jesus Christ on my show.

1272
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:46,900
Yeah, I think that's performative.

1273
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:47,900
Maybe.

1274
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:48,900
Just a ten.

1275
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:49,900
Yeah, I think that's a little bit.

1276
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:50,900
Just a hair.

1277
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:56,580
So Alex thanks the audience here for putting his content out into the world, making copies

1278
01:01:56,580 --> 01:02:01,420
of his videos and stuff, because those things aren't going to spread themselves, and 90%

1279
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:02,420
success rate.

1280
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:03,420
90% wake up.

1281
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:04,420
Pretty impressive.

1282
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:06,020
We've got to research that, because whatever he's doing...

1283
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:10,180
I can only commend you, thank you so much for what you've done.

1284
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:14,220
In fact, I never thanked the listeners enough, the people that have gotten my films, the

1285
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:17,420
people that have made copies and are still making copies.

1286
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:20,140
Those that have aired them on local community TV stations.

1287
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:23,340
Those that have rented out the movie theaters and shown it.

1288
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:30,740
Those that have rented out the local gym or ample theater and shown it on a big screen

1289
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:31,740
TV.

1290
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:34,460
I want to commend everybody.

1291
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:35,460
God bless you.

1292
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:39,100
It's really having an effect, because we could back the globalist off.

1293
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:44,300
I have no doubt that if we wouldn't have been fighting them on 9-1-1 and exposing their

1294
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:47,940
involvement, the globalist would have already carried out more chairs.

1295
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:48,940
Fuck you.

1296
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:49,940
Yup.

1297
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:50,940
Wow.

1298
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:55,460
I'm a fan of that kind of framing of things, you know?

1299
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:56,460
That's always really fun.

1300
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:57,980
Like, if we hadn't been doing this...

1301
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:03,100
You know, actually, your supporting my show and spreading my materials has actually made

1302
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:06,180
it so the globalists can't pull off another 9-11.

1303
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:07,180
Yup.

1304
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:08,180
Yup.

1305
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:09,580
It's so great.

1306
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:16,300
That's why Mark Wahlberg flies on every flight he can, all day every day, because he's trying

1307
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:21,180
to make sure that no more 9-11s will happen, and the only way to stop it is to put a Mark

1308
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:26,380
Wahlberg on your plane and have an Alex tell you how to stop it, I guess.

1309
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:27,380
Right.

1310
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:28,380
There we go.

1311
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:29,380
We did it.

1312
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:31,380
I think we've just fixed terrorism.

1313
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:37,340
Can you imagine what kind of a shithead you'd have to be to act like this?

1314
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:41,620
We could be like, okay, hey, thanks everyone for supporting our podcast, and actually,

1315
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:45,300
I'm certain that there would have been another Oklahoma City bombing, there would have been

1316
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:50,140
another Patriot federal building bombing if you hadn't been supporting our show.

1317
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:51,740
What the fuck?

1318
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:58,420
Listen, your support for our show made it so January 6th was not as bad as it could

1319
01:03:58,420 --> 01:03:59,420
have been.

1320
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:01,940
Could have been worse, but we did it.

1321
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:02,940
Here's the problem.

1322
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:04,900
That is something that did happen.

1323
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:09,700
Alex is making up imaginary things that didn't happen because his show is finished.

1324
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:15,080
So what you're saying is, we successfully stopped the attack on January 7th.

1325
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:16,780
That would be how you'd have to frame it.

1326
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:17,780
Okay.

1327
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:18,780
Then we did it.

1328
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:19,780
Okay.

1329
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:26,660
So there's some people who are saying that the war is kind of like a holy war.

1330
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:27,820
Yeah, that's not good.

1331
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:28,820
No.

1332
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:29,820
And Alex thinks that's bullshit.

1333
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:30,820
Good.

1334
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:31,820
However...

1335
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:32,820
Oh, no.

1336
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:38,660
And they said, this is a holy war and you're with the devil if you're against it.

1337
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:39,660
That was a fraud.

1338
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:45,140
But when they said that God has taken his protection away from America and allowed these

1339
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:49,300
attacks to take place because we have become a corrupt and decadent nation on average,

1340
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:51,380
that was true.

1341
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:53,140
It's a scientific fact.

1342
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:54,780
You read what's shown.

1343
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:55,780
Okay.

1344
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:56,780
All right.

1345
01:04:56,780 --> 01:04:57,780
Okay.

1346
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:02,620
It is a scientific fact that God removed his protection over the United States.

1347
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:03,620
That's why 9-11 happened.

1348
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:06,220
In order to allow 9-11 to happen.

1349
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:07,220
Yep.

1350
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:09,180
And that is why it's not a holy war.

1351
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:10,180
No.

1352
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:12,660
Because it's divine retribution.

1353
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:17,500
Also, Alex does say now that people who are against him are with the devil.

1354
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:18,760
Yes, 100%.

1355
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:20,740
So I guess it's a holy war now.

1356
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:22,620
Well, now it's a holy war.

1357
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:23,620
Right.

1358
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:24,620
But back then it wasn't.

1359
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:28,300
I'd like him to scientifically prove that God's protection was removed and that's what

1360
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:29,300
made 9-11 happen.

1361
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:36,100
Yeah, what exactly is God's protection doing around the United States prior to that area?

1362
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:39,300
Did we never have any terrorist attacks prior to that?

1363
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:40,300
None.

1364
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:41,300
None.

1365
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:42,300
Okay, good.

1366
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:45,900
So Alex takes another call from a guy and he brings up scripture in a kind of clunky

1367
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:46,900
way.

1368
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:47,900
I just found this to be amusing.

1369
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:50,260
Bill in New Jersey, you're up next.

1370
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:51,260
Howard, go ahead.

1371
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:52,260
Yes, sir.

1372
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:53,260
Mr. Alex Jones.

1373
01:05:53,260 --> 01:06:03,340
I have recently been reading in 2 Chronicles 23-11 and, you know, they anointed a son of

1374
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:07,780
a king, you know, they said God saved the king, you know.

1375
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:09,780
23-11 wasn't long.

1376
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:14,740
So I don't know if you're familiar with 2 Chronicles 23-11.

1377
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:15,740
Okay.

1378
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:16,740
Okay.

1379
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:17,740
All right.

1380
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:18,740
Okay.

1381
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:20,300
Got a weird vibe going on.

1382
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:21,300
Yep.

1383
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:22,300
Don't know what's happening.

1384
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:23,780
Are you guys talking about kings?

1385
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:24,780
Well.

1386
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:25,780
Something?

1387
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:29,380
The Chronicles are about the, I mean, they're literal chronicles of all the cool shit that

1388
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:30,740
the kings did.

1389
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:31,740
Sure.

1390
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:32,740
Sure.

1391
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:35,580
So, easy caller, easy.

1392
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:36,580
What do you want to talk about?

1393
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:37,580
Let's hear it.

1394
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:42,100
But the idea of this, I've got a book here that says the true story of the seventh in

1395
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:47,140
line to the British crown, and of course in that book is pictures of the mother and the

1396
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:51,500
queen's mother, and they all kind of look like the Bush family, you know.

1397
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:54,260
And of course I know that the Constitution was...

1398
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:57,780
You're talking about British Israelism.

1399
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:59,280
Well that's possible.

1400
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,780
No he's not.

1401
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:03,180
But that's interesting, because that implies...

1402
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:05,980
That Alex knows very clearly what British Israelism is.

1403
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:07,380
Well at least he knows of it.

1404
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:08,380
Yes.

1405
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:09,380
It doesn't imply that.

1406
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:12,140
It proves that Alex is aware of it as a concept, he knows it's a thing.

1407
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:17,860
It's not something that he can feign complete ignorance about, which is a problem.

1408
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:18,860
Yeah.

1409
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:24,100
So the true caller, what he's talking about is a book that is about Prince Charles' brother,

1410
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:28,180
his younger brother, the seventh in line for the...

1411
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:32,140
It's not Andrew, it's the other, I think Edward is the other brother.

1412
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:33,140
Sure.

1413
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:34,140
Nah, whatever.

1414
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:35,140
I don't like royals.

1415
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:38,180
Yeah, it's just some biography about him.

1416
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:39,180
Sure.

1417
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:42,260
I don't think it has anything to do with British Israelism.

1418
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:46,860
It sounds like where he's going is that the Bushes are related to the British royal family.

1419
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:50,100
Well, I don't know where he's going exactly.

1420
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:51,660
Well, that's fair.

1421
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:53,140
And I've listened to this.

1422
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:54,140
That's fair.

1423
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:55,140
That is fair.

1424
01:07:55,140 --> 01:08:00,100
So the caller brought up the scripture, and he's talking about anointing of kings is in

1425
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:01,100
the Bible.

1426
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:02,100
Right.

1427
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:07,420
And he's saying he read this book about the royals, and they look like Bushes or whatever.

1428
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:08,420
Right.

1429
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:09,420
Right.

1430
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:13,700
And so I miked down for this, because I want you to help me out here.

1431
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:14,700
Okay.

1432
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:20,420
And I can't tell if what this caller is bringing up is a satirical suggestion, or if it's sincere.

1433
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:21,420
Okay.

1434
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:22,420
I'm not sure.

1435
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:23,420
All right.

1436
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:29,100
You know, in the Bible, it talks about how they anointed the king and gave him the testimonies.

1437
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:33,900
And they were the Constitution, you know how they're tearing up the Constitution and manipulating

1438
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:34,900
it.

1439
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:38,820
Maybe we should forsake the Constitution and go with the king in this country.

1440
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:43,780
And we should say, God save George W. Bush, you know, King George, you know.

1441
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:50,340
So will we say that if Hitler was in Germany, let's go ahead, the Bible says follow Hitler?

1442
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:52,820
A lot of people like Hitler, you know.

1443
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:53,820
In Germany, they did.

1444
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:54,820
I don't know why.

1445
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:55,820
He was a complete badass.

1446
01:08:55,820 --> 01:09:01,380
I tell you what, I think that's another story about, I think Deuteronomy 23, 2, about, you

1447
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:06,540
know, how illegitimate children were allowed into the congregation of God for ten generations.

1448
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:10,300
It was a Jewish law, you know, Deuteronomy 23, 2.

1449
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:11,460
But that's the Old Testament.

1450
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:12,460
We have the New Testament.

1451
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:13,460
That's right.

1452
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:15,540
And I don't know what's going on here.

1453
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:20,420
I can't tell, like, I think this is a sincere suggestion that the caller is making.

1454
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:21,420
I agree.

1455
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:27,140
But I can also see a way that he's really poorly expressing sort of a point of satire,

1456
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:30,980
like, hey, you know, it's in the Bible that we have kings, why shouldn't we have King

1457
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:32,460
George?

1458
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:37,500
Like being, like presenting that as like an over-the-top argument.

1459
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:39,860
But then again, I don't know what the point of that would be.

1460
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:42,020
Like what would be underneath that satire?

1461
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:43,500
Is he satirizing the Bible?

1462
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:44,500
Uh, no.

1463
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:45,500
I don't know.

1464
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:50,300
No, I view this as him being 100% sincere.

1465
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:52,000
It kind of feels that way.

1466
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:59,680
And I think the main reason for that is he's been reading about how great kings have been

1467
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:03,980
and how a philosopher king is perhaps the best type of government that there possibly

1468
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:10,060
could be and has decided that democracy has failed us, the Constitution is meaningless,

1469
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:11,700
and we should have a king.

1470
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:12,700
Also...

1471
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:17,820
And Alex, after a little while, is going to agree with him.

1472
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:18,820
True.

1473
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:19,820
Yeah.

1474
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:24,020
Yes, I do think that Alex has come around on the idea of monarchy, at least a specific

1475
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:25,020
sort of monarchy.

1476
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:26,020
Seems like it.

1477
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:30,020
Um, yeah, weird, weird that this guy's rebuttal to Alex being like, should we all just...

1478
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:31,020
A lot of people liked Hitler.

1479
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:33,020
A lot of people liked Hitler.

1480
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:34,020
Ooh.

1481
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:35,900
A lot of people didn't.

1482
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:38,300
A lot of people didn't.

1483
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:41,200
I would say probably a significantly larger number.

1484
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:45,680
So this is something that kind of is a problem for Alex.

1485
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:50,480
Much like the Republic of Texas callers, this is something that sticks in Alex's craw.

1486
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,860
And so he goes to another call, and he's got to bring it up.

1487
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:56,140
He's got to bring up this idea of making Bush king.

1488
01:10:56,140 --> 01:11:00,420
Hey, what do you think of these people that say it's Christian to worship your leader

1489
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:01,980
and not criticize your leader?

1490
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:04,020
Yeah, yeah, that's another important thing.

1491
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:07,420
You know, don't put down a king just because he's king.

1492
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:08,420
What?

1493
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:11,180
He's a good king, he's a bad king.

1494
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:15,180
And my family, I have two lines of royal blood dating back, I don't know how long.

1495
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:16,180
I'm sorry, what now?

1496
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:20,780
The one, I'm not going to say the name, but he was elected by the people.

1497
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:23,460
The people held him up, and they said, we want him king.

1498
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:28,020
Sir, sir, sir, this whole thing of getting rid of the Constitution and making Bush king.

1499
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:32,040
George Washington fought in the backyard of the house I grew up in.

1500
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,940
This didn't go the way Alex wanted it to.

1501
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:36,640
Yeah, this is spiraled out of control pretty quickly.

1502
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:38,900
This is spiraled out of control real quick.

1503
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:42,900
Hey buddy, I kind of got the sense that maybe you'd back me up on this whole making kings

1504
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:43,900
thing is bad.

1505
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:47,220
Hey, some kings are good, actually I have two royal blood lines.

1506
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:51,460
Yeah, yeah, that's definitely not what you would be expecting.

1507
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:58,260
I mean, if you're Alex, with your Alex audience, I can't imagine you would get two pro-monarchy

1508
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:00,860
people in a row.

1509
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:02,420
That would be a surprise to me as well.

1510
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:06,500
Yeah, I mean, at a certain point it's just like, wow, this is bad luck, it's full moon

1511
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:08,260
or something, I don't know.

1512
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:14,180
I mean, his fucking description of kings is literally, don't hate the player, hate the

1513
01:12:14,180 --> 01:12:15,180
game.

1514
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:16,180
Some kings are good.

1515
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:17,180
Some kings are good.

1516
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:21,420
Some kings are good, like the two blood lines I come from.

1517
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:22,420
I won't say which.

1518
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:24,100
No, no, no, no.

1519
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:26,740
But George Washington fought in my backyard, just throwing that out there.

1520
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:31,660
I wouldn't want to dox my blood.

1521
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:34,860
I'd hate it if the Tudors heard I was bad mouthing them behind their backs.

1522
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:37,340
Alex has said that he's related to the Tudors.

1523
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:38,340
Yes.

1524
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:39,340
Maybe they're related.

1525
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:40,340
Could be.

1526
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:41,340
Could be.

1527
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:46,180
So we're coming into the end of this here, and on the 27th Alex gets into talking a little

1528
01:12:46,180 --> 01:12:55,700
bit about some new news stories about some SSRI issues that are becoming conversations.

1529
01:12:55,700 --> 01:13:03,820
One of them is about dangers of withdrawal for some SSRI medications, and that is a real

1530
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:07,660
thing, although Alex is trying to portray it as just being on these drugs will make

1531
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:10,900
you kill people and what have you.

1532
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:17,540
I thought this was bizarre, because Alex hasn't updated any of these talking points for 18

1533
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:18,540
years.

1534
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:22,260
These are all the same things that he says just word for word.

1535
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:28,580
By the way, when they did these studies in the early 80s of Prozac, they found a large

1536
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:33,100
percentage, around 14%, had suicidal tendencies.

1537
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:35,940
You see, it puts you into a dream state.

1538
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:42,820
So you're happily bumbling around kind of in a mesmerized, mind-controlled state, literally.

1539
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:46,580
Then you have a bad day or a bad trip.

1540
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:53,740
These drugs are more associated with hallucinogens than they are with other type drug families.

1541
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:55,260
And some people just have a snap.

1542
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:58,860
I've talked to psychologists and people that know what's happening, and they say that they've

1543
01:13:58,860 --> 01:14:03,060
had patients who were on it, and they're dancing around naked with butcher knives on top of

1544
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:05,460
their houses, they kill their kids.

1545
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:10,100
Most of these women who killed their kids were on multiple drugs, almost all the shooters.

1546
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:13,260
In fact, we haven't found one yet who wasn't on these drugs.

1547
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:15,020
Yes, we have.

1548
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:19,220
It also makes you very open to suggestion.

1549
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:22,340
It puts you into a subconscious state, folks.

1550
01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:25,460
These people are sleepwalking.

1551
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:29,620
This is just exactly the same sort of stuff that he says all the time.

1552
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:33,460
And the thing that I think is really interesting is that story about the butcher knife on top

1553
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:38,700
of a roof is also the specific example that he uses for years and years.

1554
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:46,260
This one image that he has of a case of somebody with a butcher knife on a roof, I think this

1555
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:47,780
is just deeply irresponsible.

1556
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:55,860
I think this is the definition of an unnuanced take on psychiatric meds.

1557
01:14:55,860 --> 01:15:06,820
Yeah, I mean, there's not much to say whenever it's like, man, in 2003, I was unmedicated

1558
01:15:06,820 --> 01:15:09,300
just coming into my own as a type one bipolar person.

1559
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:11,580
But you could see reality, man.

1560
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:20,020
And just reading about it back then, it was legitimately in the literature of bipolar

1561
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:26,120
type one was just straight up like one fifth of you don't make it for whatever reason.

1562
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:28,640
And it's related to your mental illness.

1563
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:32,260
And like that idea of somebody being like, well, you know what?

1564
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:39,380
That's better than SSRIs and feeling good is just like, I just don't know how you can

1565
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:45,300
talk to somebody who's aware of the death toll that just being alive gives them.

1566
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:46,300
Yeah.

1567
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:47,300
Yeah.

1568
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:48,300
It's real shitty.

1569
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:54,540
In a way you could say that giving someone life is in fact giving someone death.

1570
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:59,980
Yeah, there's a lot of factors and variables that Alex isn't taking into account here.

1571
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:05,860
And obviously any medication that people take isn't without risk.

1572
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:11,040
Living without medications for some people is also a great risk.

1573
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:17,500
And it's unfair to attack medication because of the risk while not accepting that there

1574
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:21,780
is a great risk to not taking medication.

1575
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:26,460
And the fucked up part of it, the fucked up part of it is what one of the biggest contributors

1576
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:27,500
to that is.

1577
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:32,280
Let's say you were on an SSRI and then you listen to a fucking radio show and suddenly

1578
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:34,900
decided to stop taking your medication.

1579
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:40,200
And then your withdrawals fucking light you up and you become part of the statistics that

1580
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:45,460
Alex is going to use the next year to say that people who are on SSRI should immediately

1581
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:48,740
stop them as part of his evidence for what's just so fucking-

1582
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:55,780
I have to correct you because it is that Alex does bring up that just stopping taking meds

1583
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:56,780
is dangerous.

1584
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:57,780
Well that's good.

1585
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:58,780
Yeah.

1586
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:04,500
I don't know if it's enough to dissuade his listeners who hear him say that taking meds

1587
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:10,340
make you have a bad trip or you're just brainwashed and sleepwalking through life.

1588
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:17,260
But he does actually say that you need to take a decreasing dose and it's dangerous

1589
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:18,420
just to stop.

1590
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:19,420
That's very good.

1591
01:17:19,420 --> 01:17:20,420
Yeah.

1592
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:21,420
I mean credit where credit's due.

1593
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:22,420
Oh totally.

1594
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:26,140
At the very least he's doing the absolute bare minimum while fear mongering about the

1595
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:27,140
meds.

1596
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:31,420
I just couldn't let that not be said because he does actually-

1597
01:17:31,420 --> 01:17:34,420
It's good to say, it's good to point out, yes.

1598
01:17:34,420 --> 01:17:38,300
Now unfortunately he also says things like this.

1599
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:42,220
And that says, last year more than 22 million prescriptions for antidepressants were written

1600
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:44,140
out by British patients.

1601
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:45,140
Most of them for SSRIs.

1602
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:50,820
These drugs work by allowing the hormone serotonin to act properly in the brain controlling mood

1603
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:51,820
swings.

1604
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:53,540
Oh to act properly.

1605
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:54,540
How about you go for a jog?

1606
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:56,860
How about you splash some cold water on your face?

1607
01:17:56,860 --> 01:18:00,220
How about you get on your knees and ask God to heal you?

1608
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:06,860
Because believe me folks, their vaccines, their drugs are a bunch of trash.

1609
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:07,860
Yeah.

1610
01:18:07,860 --> 01:18:10,140
And apparently you should just pray.

1611
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:15,220
Well, you know, I feel like I'm worthless and like I'm a drain on every single human

1612
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:20,340
being around me and that every part of life would be improved if I were no longer here

1613
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:21,340
for it.

1614
01:18:21,340 --> 01:18:23,100
But actually you know what I should have just done?

1615
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:24,100
Jog.

1616
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:25,100
Gone for a run.

1617
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:26,100
Yeah.

1618
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:27,100
My bad, my bad.

1619
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:28,100
Just jog.

1620
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:32,060
While I was running I definitely wouldn't fixate on those very same repetitive thoughts

1621
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:33,180
that I can't get out of my way.

1622
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:36,020
No, you should just pray that God heals you.

1623
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:37,660
She's gotta pray.

1624
01:18:37,660 --> 01:18:40,940
Man, that advice really worked for me when I was growing up.

1625
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:41,940
Oh me too.

1626
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:42,940
I got that one a lot.

1627
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:43,940
Yeah.

1628
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:44,940
Fixed everything.

1629
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:45,940
Yeah, it solved a lot of problems.

1630
01:18:45,940 --> 01:18:52,420
I mean, look, I don't want to like give any credence to what Alex is saying, but you know,

1631
01:18:52,420 --> 01:18:55,140
exercise can help people feel better.

1632
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:57,820
Exercise and meditation are great ways to cope.

1633
01:18:57,820 --> 01:18:59,180
They absolutely are.

1634
01:18:59,180 --> 01:19:00,180
Yeah.

1635
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:06,140
But that is not a full health regimen necessarily.

1636
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:13,580
And I think that this is just kind of dangerous, kind of bad, and I think, you know, obviously

1637
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:17,700
it's not what I'm looking for in terms of figuring out if Alex believes he's fighting

1638
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:19,340
the literal devil.

1639
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:23,920
There's a corollary here that Alex does seem to think that health can be achieved by God

1640
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:25,100
giving it to you.

1641
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:26,100
Yes.

1642
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:27,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1643
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:32,740
So there is at least some kind of weird religiosity here.

1644
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:41,780
Yeah, I mean, there's definitely an escalation from metaphorical to Jesus and God having

1645
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:50,140
a literal effect on curing you, which suggests that they are real, literally, and if they

1646
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:54,460
are real literally, then his cosmology suggests that the devil is real literally.

1647
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:59,980
I'm not positive that that is an assumption that you can make, because I think that a

1648
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:07,900
lot of people can believe in literalness of God's existence without believing literally

1649
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:10,500
in an antagonist Satan.

1650
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:12,100
Sure, sure.

1651
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:14,100
That's, I agree with you, that's true.

1652
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:19,740
I think the evidence presented so far in 2003 of Alex, though, is such that you can't be

1653
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:26,780
like, I'm guessing his belief in the Bible does not include Satan.

1654
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:31,700
But I also think that you can believe in the literalness of God and not necessarily believe

1655
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:35,860
in the literalness of prayer is a health care plan.

1656
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:36,860
True.

1657
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:43,980
You know, like, I think that there is a difference between those kinds of engagement with religion.

1658
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:44,980
Yeah, absolutely.

1659
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:52,140
And I think you're seeing that Alex is at least clearly in the God is better than single

1660
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:53,140
payer.

1661
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:54,140
Yes.

1662
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:55,140
Yes.

1663
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:56,900
In 2003, but I still haven't found...

1664
01:20:56,900 --> 01:20:57,900
Single payer?

1665
01:20:57,900 --> 01:20:58,900
More like single prayer.

1666
01:20:58,900 --> 01:20:59,900
Boom.

1667
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:00,900
That's what we do.

1668
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:06,220
I still haven't found enough evidence of literal Satan, so we will keep looking.

1669
01:21:06,220 --> 01:21:08,380
Although this episode was just bizarre.

1670
01:21:08,380 --> 01:21:14,740
I mean, beyond just the boringness of it, it's very boring.

1671
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:16,340
Just standard ass Bilderberg shit.

1672
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:17,340
Yeah.

1673
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:22,220
But behind that, you have two guys who are, have a lot of appearances of anti-Semitism,

1674
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:26,500
who are the experts that Alex has on to talk about the Bilderberg stuff, which I think

1675
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:29,860
is a problem, and it definitely merits attention.

1676
01:21:29,860 --> 01:21:30,860
Yeah.

1677
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:38,860
Next, the other thing that I'm seeing here, bizarrely, 22nd to 27th of May, 2003, Alex

1678
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:40,700
isn't talking about Putin.

1679
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:41,700
No.

1680
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:43,420
It was conspicuous in its absence.

1681
01:21:43,420 --> 01:21:47,580
I don't think it means anything, but it's like he would talk about the fucking apartments

1682
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:51,180
and Putin constantly, and on these episodes, it doesn't come up.

1683
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:53,980
It might just be that he had other things to talk about, but.

1684
01:21:53,980 --> 01:21:59,720
I mean, I would get distracted too if my guests were notorious anti-Semites and my callers

1685
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:01,980
were oddly pro-monarchy.

1686
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:04,260
I would get tossed out of my regular.

1687
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:08,460
And one guy found an 800 seat Nazi church in the middle of nowhere.

1688
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:11,100
That would toss me from my regular Putin stuff.

1689
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:12,100
Yeah.

1690
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:13,900
Got other fish to fry.

1691
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:17,140
Or at the very least, I'm distracted by those jangling keys.

1692
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:18,140
Sure.

1693
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:19,140
Yeah.

1694
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:24,540
We have a website on Friday, but until then, we have a website and we have a show on Thursday.

1695
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:25,540
Yes we do.

1696
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:30,140
Thursday, July 1st, it's at 9 p.m. at the Lincoln Lodge, there are still some tickets

1697
01:22:30,140 --> 01:22:31,140
available.

1698
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:32,900
I will have buttons there.

1699
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:33,900
Ooh.

1700
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:36,460
Probably not the new buttons, but I have some holdover buttons.

1701
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:37,460
Nice.

1702
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:39,420
And if anybody wants to come out, I'll throw a button at you.

1703
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:40,420
We'll get buttons.

1704
01:22:40,420 --> 01:22:41,420
Yeah.

1705
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:43,660
You will get, I guarantee, buttons will be tossed at you.

1706
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:45,220
There will be some buttons there.

1707
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:47,460
Yeah, it'll be a good time.

1708
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:52,180
So if you're in Chicago, obviously it's not going to be a live show of our show.

1709
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:53,180
Right.

1710
01:22:53,180 --> 01:22:59,200
But it is something that, I think that we will have a feeling of, is there an interest

1711
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:05,060
for a show based on, like if no one comes to this, then I think we'll continue recording

1712
01:23:05,060 --> 01:23:06,060
in my apartment.

1713
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:07,980
It does seem like that might be the way to go.

1714
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:11,740
I don't want that to be a threat, but.

1715
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:14,180
No that was a very good, that was a very good plug.

1716
01:23:14,180 --> 01:23:15,180
Well done.

1717
01:23:15,180 --> 01:23:16,340
Thanks, we're also on Twitter.

1718
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:18,820
We are on Twitter, it's that knowledge, go to bed Jordan.

1719
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:19,820
We're on Facebook.

1720
01:23:19,820 --> 01:23:20,820
We are on Facebook.

1721
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:27,420
If you would like to download a show, go to, apologies, iTunes, iTunes, I lost my mind

1722
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:31,860
there for a second, iTunes and then find a local charity or bail fund in your area.

1723
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:37,220
We'll be back, but until then, I'm Neo, I'm Leo, I'm DZX Clark, I'm Daryl Rundis, I actually

1724
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:44,740
found Barack Obama's secret Baha'i church in Evanston.

1725
01:23:44,740 --> 01:23:47,820
It's actually just the Baha'i temple in Evanston.

1726
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:48,820
It's not secret.

1727
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:50,780
I don't think Obama ever went there.

1728
01:23:50,780 --> 01:23:53,580
I just found this really cool building.

1729
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:55,940
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding.

1730
01:23:55,940 --> 01:24:00,660
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan, I love your work.

1731
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:15,340
I love you.
