WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:23.960
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying, we are the bad guys, knowledge

00:23.960 --> 00:24.960
fight.

00:24.960 --> 00:30.840
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying, we are the bad guys, knowledge

00:30.840 --> 00:31.840
fight.

00:31.840 --> 00:32.840
Dan and Jordan, knowledge fight.

00:32.840 --> 00:33.840
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her.

00:33.840 --> 00:34.840
I need, I need money.

00:34.840 --> 00:35.840
Riddle her, riddle her, riddle her.

00:35.840 --> 00:36.840
Andy and Kansas.

00:36.840 --> 00:37.840
Andy and Kansas.

00:37.840 --> 00:38.840
Stop it.

00:38.840 --> 00:39.840
Andy and Kansas.

00:39.840 --> 00:40.840
Andy and Kansas.

00:40.840 --> 00:41.840
It's time to pray.

00:41.840 --> 00:42.840
Andy and Kansas, you're on the air.

00:42.840 --> 00:43.840
Thanks for holding us.

00:43.840 --> 00:44.840
Hello, Alex.

00:44.840 --> 00:45.840
I'm a first-time caller.

00:45.840 --> 00:46.840
I'm a huge fan.

00:46.840 --> 00:47.840
I love your room.

00:47.840 --> 00:48.840
Knowledge fight.

00:48.840 --> 00:55.760
Knowledgefight.com I love you.

00:55.760 --> 01:00.040
Hey, everybody.

01:00.040 --> 01:01.040
Welcome back to Knowledge Fight.

01:01.040 --> 01:02.040
I'm Dan.

01:02.040 --> 01:03.040
I'm Jordan.

01:03.040 --> 01:04.040
We're a couple dudes.

01:04.040 --> 01:06.100
We like to sit around, drink novelty beverages, and talk a little bit about Alex Jones and

01:06.100 --> 01:08.600
also worship at the altar of Selene.

01:08.600 --> 01:09.600
Damn it.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.600
Autopilot, baby.

01:10.600 --> 01:11.600
Hey, hey, it's okay.

01:11.600 --> 01:12.600
It's okay.

01:12.600 --> 01:13.600
It's okay.

01:13.600 --> 01:14.600
It's okay.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.540
We got a sneaky steak episode.

01:16.540 --> 01:18.120
You don't have to nail it perfectly.

01:18.120 --> 01:21.960
I didn't even realize that until after it had come out of my mouth that I had, yeah.

01:21.960 --> 01:23.440
No, I didn't hear it at all.

01:23.440 --> 01:24.440
Wow.

01:24.440 --> 01:27.920
I heard you say worship at the altar of Selene and then just let it, yeah.

01:27.920 --> 01:31.840
I think I've been making so many buttons with Selene on them that it's just like-

01:31.840 --> 01:33.880
It's in your brain all the time.

01:33.880 --> 01:34.880
That's where that lives.

01:34.880 --> 01:36.480
It's an unspoken situation.

01:36.480 --> 01:37.480
Yes.

01:37.480 --> 01:38.480
Yes, Dan.

01:38.480 --> 01:40.040
But I do have a question for you.

01:40.040 --> 01:41.040
Sure.

01:41.040 --> 01:42.040
What's your bright spot today?

01:42.040 --> 01:49.480
My bright spot today, Jordan, is a lot of nice messages that people have sent with the

01:49.480 --> 01:51.460
requests for buttons.

01:51.460 --> 01:56.920
As I make these buttons, unfortunately, there's so many that I cannot possibly respond to

01:56.920 --> 01:57.920
most of these.

01:57.920 --> 01:58.920
Yeah.

01:58.920 --> 02:02.880
So please just know that I have read these messages and I very much appreciate them,

02:02.880 --> 02:06.960
and their buttons will be sent as they're received.

02:06.960 --> 02:07.960
Also-

02:07.960 --> 02:11.640
Here's your response to the message, some fucking buttons.

02:11.640 --> 02:12.640
That's right.

02:12.640 --> 02:14.040
I'm taking a weirdly aggressive tone.

02:14.040 --> 02:15.040
Yes.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.040
That is how I'm feeling.

02:16.040 --> 02:21.120
Also, something that has come up a number of times is people wanting to pay for postage,

02:21.120 --> 02:26.200
particularly international wonks, thinking like, I'll pay something for postage.

02:26.200 --> 02:31.400
That's a really nice thing, but I want this to be a gift for folks.

02:31.400 --> 02:35.560
I appreciate that, but I don't want to accept that, but I also don't want to be disrespectful

02:35.560 --> 02:36.560
to that generosity.

02:36.560 --> 02:37.560
Of course not.

02:37.560 --> 02:43.720
So if anybody feels the desire to, here's what I would say, this is my blanket response.

02:43.720 --> 02:48.140
Feel free to give a little donation to a charity that you support, or you think that Selene

02:48.140 --> 02:52.520
would support, and do it in the name of my cat.

02:52.520 --> 02:53.520
Yes.

02:53.520 --> 02:58.160
We will all worship at the altar of Selene eventually, because that is the name that

02:58.160 --> 03:02.000
will be donating to every cause from now on.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.600
Right, donate to a charity in my cat's name, and that'll be good for the postage.

03:07.600 --> 03:09.240
That'll be good for everybody.

03:09.240 --> 03:10.240
Yeah.

03:10.240 --> 03:15.760
So my bright spot was thinking about that.

03:15.760 --> 03:21.260
Imagine if we were as wealthy as Bill Gates, and you were just like, ah, our foundation

03:21.260 --> 03:23.040
is named the Cult of Selene.

03:23.040 --> 03:24.040
Let's move on.

03:24.040 --> 03:26.200
Yeah, that wouldn't start any conspiracies at all.

03:26.200 --> 03:28.200
No problem at all there.

03:28.200 --> 03:32.160
We're donating $3 billion in the name of the Cult of Selene.

03:32.160 --> 03:33.160
Uh-oh.

03:33.160 --> 03:34.160
Uh-oh.

03:34.160 --> 03:35.160
Yeah.

03:35.160 --> 03:36.160
What's your bright spot, Jordan?

03:36.160 --> 03:38.160
Dan, my bright spot is Wimbledon!

03:38.160 --> 03:40.320
Goddammit, what a tennis.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.320
Another tennis one.

03:41.320 --> 03:44.480
No, this year, because of the, I don't know if you noticed, but the past year has been

03:44.480 --> 03:45.480
rough.

03:45.480 --> 03:46.480
Yeah.

03:46.480 --> 03:50.080
So this year, the French Open and Wimbledon were only a month apart, and I will tell you

03:50.080 --> 03:52.240
this, inspiring shit, Dan.

03:52.240 --> 03:53.240
Whoa.

03:53.240 --> 03:54.240
Andy Murray.

03:54.240 --> 03:55.240
Andy Murray.

03:55.240 --> 03:56.240
The Andy Murray?

03:56.240 --> 03:57.240
The Andy Murray.

03:57.240 --> 03:58.240
The Andy Murray.

03:58.240 --> 04:02.600
Former member of the Big Four, back when there was a Big Four and Andy was not kicked out

04:02.600 --> 04:03.600
of it.

04:03.600 --> 04:07.040
Former world number one, destroyed by injuries.

04:07.040 --> 04:10.000
He's old as shit now.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.380
Back in Wimbledon, for the first time in years, won his first match.

04:14.380 --> 04:19.120
So did Federer, coming back after his injuries at Wimbledon, my friend.

04:19.120 --> 04:20.120
Whoa.

04:20.120 --> 04:21.400
This is a big deal.

04:21.400 --> 04:23.080
So anyway, that's my bright spot.

04:23.080 --> 04:24.080
Oh.

04:24.080 --> 04:25.800
I've got a lot of energy.

04:25.800 --> 04:28.040
Andy Murray is an amazing person.

04:28.040 --> 04:31.520
I understand that, but that was like Charlie Brown's teacher to me.

04:31.520 --> 04:33.560
That was just, wah wah, wah wah wah wah wah.

04:33.560 --> 04:36.440
I could not understand a word you were saying.

04:36.440 --> 04:39.440
This is why I keep my love to myself.

04:39.440 --> 04:40.440
Yeah.

04:40.440 --> 04:46.520
I want to care, and I want to join you in the things that make you excited, but I could

04:46.520 --> 04:49.480
not, like my eyes glazed over.

04:49.480 --> 04:55.880
I'd listen to you talk about Christian Ska on a podcast on my own time, too.

04:55.880 --> 05:01.240
Well, that's because I have interesting thoughts about it, unlike you.

05:01.240 --> 05:02.240
Unlike me and tennis?

05:02.240 --> 05:03.240
No, I understand.

05:03.240 --> 05:04.240
I understand completely.

05:04.240 --> 05:12.320
I have some more thoughts about Survivor, if you're interested.

05:12.320 --> 05:15.800
So Jordan, instead of some wonk shout-outs today, one of the things I wanted to do since

05:15.800 --> 05:21.440
we're doing a Sneaky Snake Wednesday episode here, I wanted to get into the mailbag, because

05:21.440 --> 05:22.440
it's been a little while.

05:22.440 --> 05:23.440
It has been a while.

05:23.440 --> 05:25.680
We have a little bit of catching up to do.

05:25.680 --> 05:29.480
So Steve and London, I want to give you a thanks for the Department of Truth graphic

05:29.480 --> 05:30.480
novel.

05:30.480 --> 05:31.480
Yes, thank you very much.

05:31.480 --> 05:33.160
Appreciate that.

05:33.160 --> 05:41.480
Also Jase sent some cool shirts, those Q shirts, those Q Meme shirts kind of thing, from Infidel

05:41.480 --> 05:46.280
Meme Wear, and I went over to their website and checked out some of the designs.

05:46.280 --> 05:47.800
They're pretty cool.

05:47.800 --> 05:53.400
I think there's one I may end up getting a hoodie.

05:53.400 --> 05:54.400
This is not sponsored.

05:54.400 --> 05:59.920
This isn't spawn-con, but thank you for the shirt and cool stuff.

05:59.920 --> 06:00.920
Thank you very much.

06:00.920 --> 06:06.760
Also, Keith and Laurel sent a care package a while back, and I have been horrible about

06:06.760 --> 06:08.640
giving a thank you, and I really appreciate it.

06:08.640 --> 06:10.400
Thank you, folks.

06:10.400 --> 06:14.520
Giving that horrible into lore-able, and thank you very much, Keith and Laurel.

06:14.520 --> 06:20.720
You're a basket of lore-ables.

06:20.720 --> 06:22.720
So thank you so much.

06:22.720 --> 06:26.880
Also this is something that we forgot to do, and I felt a little bit guilty about it, and

06:26.880 --> 06:30.640
that was when we were giving a thank you to Bex.

06:30.640 --> 06:34.760
Bex sent that ukulele, the pink ukulele that we were very confused about, and it turns

06:34.760 --> 06:37.120
out it was for you, because of Steven Universe.

06:37.120 --> 06:38.480
Steven Universe, pink lion!

06:38.480 --> 06:46.040
And then I got a green ukulele from Bex because of plants, but what I forgot to do was Bex

06:46.040 --> 06:51.120
requested that I give a shout-out to Quicksilver on the Discord, and I forgot to do that, and

06:51.120 --> 06:55.080
I would like to write that wrong by saying, what's up, Quicksilver?

06:55.080 --> 06:56.800
Hey, Quicksilver on the Discord.

06:56.800 --> 06:59.760
I have no idea what any of this means.

06:59.760 --> 07:03.800
This is also Charlie Brown's teachers.

07:03.800 --> 07:05.660
So Jordan, let's get heavy.

07:05.660 --> 07:10.580
Giving someone life is giving someone death.

07:10.580 --> 07:15.680
You could say that life is death.

07:15.680 --> 07:16.680
You could.

07:16.680 --> 07:17.680
You could.

07:17.680 --> 07:18.680
Happy birthday, J.G.

07:18.680 --> 07:19.680
Gunner!

07:19.680 --> 07:21.120
Hope you had a good one.

07:21.120 --> 07:24.840
Also, Dexter reached out and wanted us to wish a happy birthday to Zoe.

07:24.840 --> 07:25.840
Oh, okay.

07:25.840 --> 07:26.840
Zoe, happy birthday.

07:26.840 --> 07:31.440
Wow, you can't be named Dexter and wish a happy birthday after opening with, giving

07:31.440 --> 07:33.840
someone life is giving someone death.

07:33.840 --> 07:35.080
I have never watched that show.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.320
I don't think you need to.

07:36.320 --> 07:37.720
I think you get the reference.

07:37.720 --> 07:38.720
I do.

07:38.720 --> 07:39.720
He kills serial killers.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.200
He kills people.

07:41.200 --> 07:42.200
Mm-hmm.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.200
Yeah.

07:43.200 --> 07:44.200
Cool.

07:44.200 --> 07:45.200
I heard the ending was bad.

07:45.200 --> 07:46.200
Probably.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.200
I never watched the show either.

07:47.200 --> 07:52.440
Also, Renee checked in and wanted to wish Rosemary a happy birthday, and this is fun

07:52.440 --> 07:55.600
because Rosemary recently reached out and wanted to wish Renee a happy birthday.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.600
Yeah, of course.

07:56.600 --> 07:57.600
Of course.

07:57.600 --> 07:58.600
So turn about is fair play.

07:58.600 --> 07:59.600
Of course.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.920
Also, Renee says, she's the best friend I could have, and thanks for putting up with

08:01.920 --> 08:02.920
me.

08:02.920 --> 08:03.920
Happy birthday, Rosemary.

08:03.920 --> 08:06.160
Unfortunately, life is death.

08:06.160 --> 08:07.160
Life is death.

08:07.160 --> 08:08.160
According to Alex Jones.

08:08.160 --> 08:09.160
Uh, unfortunately.

08:09.160 --> 08:10.160
Yeah.

08:10.160 --> 08:11.160
So, Jordan, today we're in the past.

08:11.160 --> 08:12.160
Ooh.

08:12.160 --> 08:13.160
I like the past.

08:13.160 --> 08:17.840
We're digging into the past, and we're going to be talking about May 22nd through 27th,

08:17.840 --> 08:18.840
2003.

08:18.840 --> 08:19.840
2003.

08:19.840 --> 08:20.840
Yeah.

08:20.840 --> 08:21.840
No blackjack.

08:21.840 --> 08:22.840
No.

08:22.840 --> 08:24.840
Dealer got blackjacked.

08:24.840 --> 08:25.840
Yes.

08:25.840 --> 08:29.920
Um, and, oof, not great.

08:29.920 --> 08:30.920
Not a great stretch of time.

08:30.920 --> 08:34.720
If I'm going to be perfectly honest with you, there's some funny things that happen, but

08:34.720 --> 08:38.520
in terms of, like, if you're looking for anything in-depth, I am afraid you're not going to

08:38.520 --> 08:39.520
find it here.

08:39.520 --> 08:40.520
Not going to happen?

08:40.520 --> 08:41.520
No.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.520
May 22nd, not the best day of the year.

08:42.520 --> 08:46.580
22nd and 23rd, a lot of it is talking about Bilderberg.

08:46.580 --> 08:50.580
A lot of it is talking about the same sort of Bilderberg conspiracies that we've discussed

08:50.580 --> 08:57.980
over and over again, and it's very boilerplate, fairly boring, and that's Thursday and Friday.

08:57.980 --> 09:00.040
Alex doesn't have a Sunday show at this point.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.040
Right.

09:01.040 --> 09:04.000
Monday is a repeat of a show from the past week.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Wow.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Because I think it's Memorial Day.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Oh, okay.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
That makes sense.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.640
And then, so Tuesday, he comes back on the 27th, and there's a little bit of interesting

09:12.640 --> 09:15.600
callers maybe, but, like, there is nothing going on.

09:15.600 --> 09:16.600
Oh, man.

09:16.600 --> 09:18.960
It is a wasteland.

09:18.960 --> 09:23.960
I like how we've gotten so far into this show that a Bilderberg conspiracy, we're like,

09:23.960 --> 09:25.360
Jesus, that's quaint.

09:25.360 --> 09:26.360
Back in the day.

09:26.360 --> 09:27.360
It kind of is.

09:27.360 --> 09:28.360
Oh, Bilderberg, yeah.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.360
They were scary back then.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.360
Oh, man.

09:30.360 --> 09:31.600
Bill Gates is killing everyone now!

09:31.600 --> 09:33.480
Bill Gates-ter-berg.

09:33.480 --> 09:38.200
There's one thing about the people that he has to talk about Bilderberg that I think

09:38.200 --> 09:45.440
is worth pointing out, but in terms of the actual conspiracies, they're all just exactly

09:45.440 --> 09:47.640
the same stuff, as always.

09:47.640 --> 09:48.640
Yeah.

09:48.640 --> 09:49.640
So...

09:49.640 --> 09:53.600
I feel like a pertinent question every opening of the show is just going to be like, hey,

09:53.600 --> 09:56.160
are we going to be getting into Blood Libel today, Dan?

09:56.160 --> 09:57.160
Yep.

09:57.160 --> 09:59.160
That's what I thought.

09:59.160 --> 10:01.120
Do you say Bilderberg in 2003?

10:01.120 --> 10:05.840
I'm guessing anti-Semitism might come quicker than you think.

10:05.840 --> 10:12.120
So we start here on the 22nd, and not much is going on until Alex takes some calls.

10:12.120 --> 10:19.880
He takes some calls fairly early in the episode, and Alex, I think he's trying, he's Mr. Brightside.

10:19.880 --> 10:20.880
He's talking to this caller.

10:20.880 --> 10:21.880
Okay.

10:21.880 --> 10:25.400
Yeah, I just wanted to tell you, like, what I do, so, like, if other people are listening,

10:25.400 --> 10:26.400
they'll do the same.

10:26.400 --> 10:31.920
Like, I make, like, books with news stories, and I pass them all out, and I pass out your

10:31.920 --> 10:35.240
movies, and 9-1-1 is the best one.

10:35.240 --> 10:36.800
That's amazing.

10:36.800 --> 10:41.920
Well, we're getting 90% wake up with Road to Tyranny of People.

10:41.920 --> 10:47.200
Yeah, I get a lot of people who, yeah, they wake up and stuff, but, like, some of my friends,

10:47.200 --> 10:51.440
like, if they even start talking to me about it, like, they're girlfriends or wives, you

10:51.440 --> 10:54.600
know, like, give them a look, you know, they're not allowed to talk to me.

10:54.600 --> 10:58.400
Most of my friends don't even talk to me anymore.

10:58.400 --> 10:59.400
Man.

10:59.400 --> 11:00.400
Man.

11:00.400 --> 11:01.400
Don't blame the girlfriends.

11:01.400 --> 11:06.880
Yeah, everyone's waking up, but now they won't talk to me anymore because their girlfriends

11:06.880 --> 11:09.200
won't let them.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.200
That's very sad.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.080
That, that, uh, that is unfortunate.

11:12.080 --> 11:14.920
That is, that is bad.

11:14.920 --> 11:19.840
I need, I need corroborating evidence on we're getting 90% wake up.

11:19.840 --> 11:20.840
Well, actually-

11:20.840 --> 11:23.240
I need a survey response.

11:23.240 --> 11:25.720
I need, uh, something.

11:25.720 --> 11:26.720
I need something.

11:26.720 --> 11:27.720
A Rasmussen poll.

11:27.720 --> 11:32.160
You can't, look, I remember back when I first started out my job, one of the ways that we

11:32.160 --> 11:37.600
marketed was with direct mail campaigns and you get like a 0.5% response.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.360
That was the industry average.

11:39.360 --> 11:43.560
If you're telling me, if you're telling me you're getting 90% wake up out of this, I

11:43.560 --> 11:44.760
got to know what you're doing.

11:44.760 --> 11:45.760
Yeah.

11:45.760 --> 11:51.480
It's like, if you're getting 90% response, uh, to something, it's gotta be like heroin.

11:51.480 --> 11:52.480
Yeah, totally.

11:52.480 --> 11:53.480
Totally.

11:53.480 --> 11:56.520
Or, or, or sophisticated brainwashing.

11:56.520 --> 12:01.800
Um, so I actually do have a little bit of insight into this because Alex was talking

12:01.800 --> 12:07.360
to another caller and he gives out DVDs to people and he's like, I'm getting a hundred

12:07.360 --> 12:13.160
percent response from people, a hundred percent wake up and they talk about it.

12:13.160 --> 12:20.280
And the way that this guy's defining that is that everybody who takes the DVD seems

12:20.280 --> 12:24.060
happy about it.

12:24.060 --> 12:27.840
But still there's a lot of people who are not taking the DVDs.

12:27.840 --> 12:32.520
Which also means, um, they didn't necessarily watch it.

12:32.520 --> 12:33.520
Yeah.

12:33.520 --> 12:37.640
I don't know if there's follow up with these people about the content of it.

12:37.640 --> 12:38.800
I don't know.

12:38.800 --> 12:43.500
Uh, but this caller in particular, this first one is just really bumming me out because

12:43.500 --> 12:46.720
you know, you can really see what this looks like in real life.

12:46.720 --> 12:48.040
You know what this looks like in real life.

12:48.040 --> 12:49.040
Yep.

12:49.040 --> 12:52.200
They're telling you weird shit and then their girlfriend's like, look, we can't have him

12:52.200 --> 12:53.200
at parties anymore.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.920
He really freaks out my normal friends.

12:55.920 --> 12:56.920
Totally.

12:56.920 --> 12:57.920
Totally.

12:57.920 --> 12:58.920
Yep.

12:58.920 --> 13:03.200
He said something incredibly rude because somebody challenged him on this and he freaked

13:03.200 --> 13:05.300
out because you're not awake.

13:05.300 --> 13:07.360
We can't live that way.

13:07.360 --> 13:08.720
That's not how we live.

13:08.720 --> 13:13.080
If that guy wants to be over there by himself listening to Alex, fine.

13:13.080 --> 13:14.080
Yeah.

13:14.080 --> 13:20.560
Um, so this behavior also apparently extends to digital stuff with this caller.

13:20.560 --> 13:21.560
Sure.

13:21.560 --> 13:25.800
Now every seed sprouts the first year and they're dormant.

13:25.800 --> 13:30.360
I email stories like when people send me them stupid emails with like, you know, it's forwarded

13:30.360 --> 13:31.780
a thousand times.

13:31.780 --> 13:33.120
I still all them emails.

13:33.120 --> 13:39.000
I email like Post Gazette and Trib stories and uh, and there's links with your movie

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
on there.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.120
I emailed that to people.

13:41.120 --> 13:45.840
I probably emailed like thousands and I probably got back like, like 20 responses.

13:45.840 --> 13:50.560
I got like five thank yous and most people, you know, tell me I'm crazy or where'd you

13:50.560 --> 13:51.560
get my email from?

13:51.560 --> 13:53.560
You know, that's about a half a percent.

13:53.560 --> 13:56.960
All right sir, I appreciate the call.

13:56.960 --> 13:57.960
Yeah.

13:57.960 --> 14:00.780
He's one of those weirdos that thinks the world is round.

14:00.780 --> 14:02.240
He's definitely a weirdo.

14:02.240 --> 14:03.640
He's definitely a weirdo.

14:03.640 --> 14:10.380
He's getting chain emails, saving people's email addresses, spamming them, and then when

14:10.380 --> 14:12.720
they respond, how did you get my email?

14:12.720 --> 14:16.280
He keeps sending them Info Wars stuff.

14:16.280 --> 14:18.760
That's, that's, that's harassment.

14:18.760 --> 14:24.620
I would say, uh, that's an interesting, look, I will give them this.

14:24.620 --> 14:29.280
That is an innovation towards chain emails that I had not even considered that you could

14:29.280 --> 14:34.240
essentially turn those into your own mailing list and just bother people for the rest of

14:34.240 --> 14:35.240
their lives.

14:35.240 --> 14:36.240
Yeah.

14:36.240 --> 14:37.720
I mean, you could do that.

14:37.720 --> 14:41.600
You'd also have to recognize if you do that, you're a piece of shit.

14:41.600 --> 14:42.600
Yes, there is that.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.640
They're not all innovations are good.

14:44.640 --> 14:47.040
No, I will agree with that.

14:47.040 --> 14:52.360
So Alex gets another call and this guy has got a bad question and Alex has a worse answer.

14:52.360 --> 14:55.680
Alex, can I ask you a real quick question before the break there?

14:55.680 --> 14:56.680
Sure.

14:56.680 --> 15:02.160
Someone told me that, uh, there, uh, the 9-11 attack, that, uh, there are 7,000 Jews that

15:02.160 --> 15:03.600
are employed in the World Trade Center.

15:03.600 --> 15:05.440
They were not employed at work that day.

15:05.440 --> 15:06.940
You ever hear anything about that?

15:06.940 --> 15:07.940
That is true.

15:07.940 --> 15:11.620
MSNBC checked into it and said the urban legend was true.

15:11.620 --> 15:15.140
Also the Jewish newspapers have reported they were told not to go to work.

15:15.140 --> 15:17.440
That is a confirmed fact.

15:17.440 --> 15:18.820
That's so fucked up.

15:18.820 --> 15:22.580
I don't think it needs to be said that Alex is completely wrong and lending credibility

15:22.580 --> 15:26.780
to an explicitly anti-Semitic conspiracy theory about 9-11 here.

15:26.780 --> 15:30.700
This is lazy, sloppy behavior that only serves to validate the complete bullshit that this

15:30.700 --> 15:33.120
caller has heard from his bigot friends.

15:33.120 --> 15:37.220
And Alex is just using his platform as a voice of authority or certainty on the subject in

15:37.220 --> 15:39.320
a way that is abhorrent.

15:39.320 --> 15:43.780
You can very easily find the names of many Jewish victims of the 9-11 attack.

15:43.780 --> 15:47.280
Some were on planes, some were firefighters who died trying to save their fellow person's

15:47.280 --> 15:50.820
lives and many worked at the World Trade Center or at the Pentagon.

15:50.820 --> 15:53.440
I could name specific names because I can.

15:53.440 --> 15:55.260
I can find them.

15:55.260 --> 16:01.300
And I've read biographic sketches of these people, little mini, mini obituaries, but

16:01.300 --> 16:04.880
I'm not going to get into specifics out of respect for those people's memories.

16:04.880 --> 16:07.460
And it wouldn't change anybody's mind anyways.

16:07.460 --> 16:10.740
This narrative was a baseless claim that was made to demonize the Jewish population of

16:10.740 --> 16:14.460
the United States and to imply some kind of complicity in the attack.

16:14.460 --> 16:16.860
Alex should be deeply ashamed of this response.

16:16.860 --> 16:22.860
I can't believe we got to the very first time in 2003 that the Jews were blamed for something

16:22.860 --> 16:24.620
that they had nothing to do with.

16:24.620 --> 16:29.500
I don't think this is the first time even in Alex's show in 2003 that we've gotten there,

16:29.500 --> 16:36.420
but it was, I thought that that was bad on Alex's part.

16:36.420 --> 16:40.500
I just think that they're, like this caller, they're going out to break.

16:40.500 --> 16:46.700
He's saying, hey, is it true that all the Jewish people were told to stay home?

16:46.700 --> 16:48.240
Yes, that is true.

16:48.240 --> 16:51.020
It costs you nothing to just be like, no.

16:51.020 --> 16:52.020
No.

16:52.020 --> 16:53.020
Actually, that is nonsense.

16:53.020 --> 16:57.760
Yeah, there's no other, I mean, there's just no interpretation of that that doesn't wind

16:57.760 --> 17:03.220
up with the Jews were involved in the planning and the attack.

17:03.220 --> 17:11.780
And it's specifically the, capital V, capital J, the Jews, not like these people, not a

17:11.780 --> 17:16.060
group of them, the entirety of Judaism.

17:16.060 --> 17:18.340
Yeah, so we're fucked.

17:18.340 --> 17:19.340
Yep.

17:19.340 --> 17:25.780
So Alex gets to a first guest here on the 22nd and it's a Bilderberg expert.

17:25.780 --> 17:29.940
I remember five, six, seven, eight years ago on the radio, I'd talk about the Bilderberg

17:29.940 --> 17:31.820
group and get calls from listeners.

17:31.820 --> 17:35.300
I heard that's a code word for terrorism.

17:35.300 --> 17:36.300
It doesn't exist.

17:36.300 --> 17:37.300
You're insane.

17:37.300 --> 17:40.420
I heard on the news, insane people believe this exists.

17:40.420 --> 17:42.940
It didn't exist.

17:42.940 --> 17:50.620
Well, it does exist and now it's public thanks to the work of folks out there like Tony Gosling

17:50.620 --> 17:53.360
of Bilderberg.org is about to join us.

17:53.360 --> 17:55.100
So I'd never heard of this dude.

17:55.100 --> 17:56.100
Tony Gosling?

17:56.100 --> 17:57.100
Yeah.

17:57.100 --> 17:59.740
I wanted to learn a little bit more about him because he's not the Bilderberg expert

17:59.740 --> 18:01.780
that I'm used to Alex having on.

18:01.780 --> 18:02.780
Wasn't he in the notebook?

18:02.780 --> 18:03.780
It's his brother.

18:03.780 --> 18:04.780
Oh, okay.

18:04.780 --> 18:10.260
When later time Alex Jones is trying to look into a Bilderberg story, he pretty much always

18:10.260 --> 18:12.380
talks to big Jim Tucker.

18:12.380 --> 18:17.220
And then in second place, if Jim's not available or had died by then, Alex would talk to Daniel

18:17.220 --> 18:18.300
Estelen.

18:18.300 --> 18:22.220
Tony Gosling's not a super relevant name in the periods that I've listened to of Alex's

18:22.220 --> 18:23.340
show.

18:23.340 --> 18:28.380
Tony runs a website called Bilderberg.org and I will say that this site pretty quickly

18:28.380 --> 18:32.380
deteriorates from being about the Bilderberg group at all.

18:32.380 --> 18:36.560
If you scroll down his homepage, you'll soon find a picture of Jesus as Che Guevara, which

18:36.560 --> 18:38.020
is on a shirt that he sells.

18:38.020 --> 18:39.020
Not good.

18:39.020 --> 18:42.300
And then a reprinting of the Ten Commandments and the Lord's Prayer.

18:42.300 --> 18:43.300
Okay.

18:43.300 --> 18:44.300
Okay.

18:44.300 --> 18:46.900
It's weirdly religiously centered for what appears to be a site about the Bilderberg

18:46.900 --> 18:51.900
group, which if I'm not mistaken and based on this interview that I'm hearing on Alex's

18:51.900 --> 18:55.240
show is supposed to be a political conspiracy.

18:55.240 --> 19:00.340
Things really fall apart when you get to the section titled, quote, My Spiritual Beliefs.

19:00.340 --> 19:01.540
No.

19:01.540 --> 19:04.400
This passage.

19:04.400 --> 19:08.380
That should be on everybody's wall.

19:08.380 --> 19:12.700
Things really fall apart when I say, here are my personal beliefs.

19:12.700 --> 19:15.420
This passage stood out as not sounding great.

19:15.420 --> 19:20.060
Quote, Many problems have been caused by some of the Jewish people's refusal to acknowledge

19:20.060 --> 19:21.580
Jesus as the Messiah.

19:21.580 --> 19:24.940
That does sound like the root cause of many problems.

19:24.940 --> 19:29.120
Many Jews, for example, live in Old Testament Torah times, believing they're still God's

19:29.120 --> 19:30.540
chosen people.

19:30.540 --> 19:34.480
It seems clear to me that God cut off the Jewish hierarchy from his favor after they

19:34.480 --> 19:37.540
pleaded successfully for the unjust death of his only son.

19:37.540 --> 19:38.540
Why?

19:38.540 --> 19:39.540
Why?

19:39.540 --> 19:40.540
Where?

19:40.540 --> 19:41.540
Where?

19:41.540 --> 19:42.540
When?

19:42.540 --> 19:43.540
Why?

19:43.540 --> 19:44.540
In the Bible?

19:44.540 --> 19:47.640
Do you mean the Bible where they wrote letters, the rest of the New Testament is writing letters

19:47.640 --> 19:50.380
to Jews about Jesus being great?

19:50.380 --> 19:57.180
There's a lot of conversation about who is or is not real Jews also on that site.

19:57.180 --> 19:58.180
There we are.

19:58.180 --> 20:00.500
It's a little convoluted and not good.

20:00.500 --> 20:01.500
Okay.

20:01.500 --> 20:02.540
The website's also just weird.

20:02.540 --> 20:06.860
If you scroll down a little bit further, you find a list of Tony's 30 top movies.

20:06.860 --> 20:07.860
The Life of Brian.

20:07.860 --> 20:08.860
What did you just say to me?

20:08.860 --> 20:09.860
The Life of Brian weirdly came in at number 24.

20:09.860 --> 20:10.860
How can the Life of Brian be on there?

20:10.860 --> 20:11.860
He likes to have fun.

20:11.860 --> 20:19.380
You know this satire of every...

20:19.380 --> 20:24.860
My personal beliefs, my 24th favorite movie eviscerates how stupid they are.

20:24.860 --> 20:25.860
Great.

20:25.860 --> 20:28.660
So after that, there's a section about how great Bill Hicks was as a comedian.

20:28.660 --> 20:29.660
I'm not kidding.

20:29.660 --> 20:30.660
I'm not kidding.

20:30.660 --> 20:31.660
I don't...

20:31.660 --> 20:32.660
There's a big section about Bill Hicks.

20:32.660 --> 20:33.660
No!

20:33.660 --> 20:36.020
What is wrong with the humanity?

20:36.020 --> 20:38.700
It's a really poorly laid out and confusing website.

20:38.700 --> 20:42.960
And I don't know if it would even be helpful, even if you did assume that he had evidence

20:42.960 --> 20:43.960
of something.

20:43.960 --> 20:48.100
Listen, religion is the center of all of our problems in this life.

20:48.100 --> 20:50.660
This guy is my favorite comedian.

20:50.660 --> 20:52.820
Anyways, here are my personal beliefs.

20:52.820 --> 20:55.860
Number four or five on his list was They Live.

20:55.860 --> 20:57.500
Oh boy.

20:57.500 --> 20:58.860
Well that one actually tracks.

20:58.860 --> 21:02.620
I didn't recognize a lot of the names of the movies and I'm guessing some of them were

21:02.620 --> 21:03.620
not good.

21:03.620 --> 21:04.820
It'd be funny if they were all...

21:04.820 --> 21:09.620
It was like They Live, The Life of Brian, and then a bunch of weird 70s art.

21:09.620 --> 21:11.380
Like Harold and Maude is up there.

21:11.380 --> 21:13.340
They shoot horses, don't they?

21:13.340 --> 21:14.820
Everything Lee Remick has ever been in.

21:14.820 --> 21:15.820
Right.

21:15.820 --> 21:16.820
Like all of that stuff.

21:16.820 --> 21:19.540
Or like Lenny Riefenstahl.

21:19.540 --> 21:23.700
Sure, sure.

21:23.700 --> 21:24.700
This was...

21:24.700 --> 21:25.700
I don't know.

21:25.700 --> 21:31.060
I didn't read over everything, but it seems like this guy's a little bit unwell and he's

21:31.060 --> 21:34.900
a bit defensive about his positions vis-à-vis Judaism.

21:34.900 --> 21:39.140
He's defensive about his movies.

21:39.140 --> 21:44.180
So welcome to Bilderberg.org Top 30 Movies.

21:44.180 --> 21:49.060
Today... a lot of the stuff that he has to say about Bilderberg is all kind of the same

21:49.060 --> 21:52.620
stuff you hear from just about any of these folks.

21:52.620 --> 21:58.860
You know, just stray talk, powerful people are there, let's imagine what they're talking

21:58.860 --> 21:59.860
about.

21:59.860 --> 22:00.860
Sure.

22:00.860 --> 22:04.480
Although this guy did have a little bit of a fun twist on it, and that he seemed to be

22:04.480 --> 22:10.660
kind of like a bird watcher for Bilderberg members, because he seemed to get really excited

22:10.660 --> 22:13.380
when he was talking about how one day, one day...

22:13.380 --> 22:14.660
He saw one in the wild.

22:14.660 --> 22:15.660
No.

22:15.660 --> 22:20.340
One day during the Bilderberg conference, all the people, all the richies who were attending

22:20.340 --> 22:23.620
the conference decided that they were going to go to the Palace of Versailles, and they

22:23.620 --> 22:29.980
were going to just go tour around, and so he was like gawking at rich, powerful people.

22:29.980 --> 22:33.340
He was really excited that David Rockefeller actually answered a couple questions from

22:33.340 --> 22:35.740
people, and it didn't seem standoffish or mad.

22:35.740 --> 22:40.060
It was like, I think you just enjoy this.

22:40.060 --> 22:41.060
There's a really...

22:41.060 --> 22:47.100
I don't see a conspiracy here, I think you like following around a powerful group of

22:47.100 --> 22:48.100
people or something.

22:48.100 --> 22:55.100
No, I feel like we're in a situation where the continuum is there's something, there's

22:55.100 --> 23:00.980
a very thin line between avid hater and fanboy.

23:00.980 --> 23:05.340
There's a very thin line between oh, I hate the Bilderberg group, and I'm going to follow

23:05.340 --> 23:08.020
them everywhere they go and hope to catch a glimpse of them.

23:08.020 --> 23:09.900
He seemed like he was on that line.

23:09.900 --> 23:10.900
Yeah.

23:10.900 --> 23:14.060
He seemed to be doing it a little bit more than a lot of the other folks, like the Tuckers

23:14.060 --> 23:20.180
or Estillans, that seemed just to be either insane or full of hate.

23:20.180 --> 23:21.180
Yeah.

23:21.180 --> 23:26.380
But yeah, this guy, I don't know, here's just a clip of...

23:26.380 --> 23:28.980
In his own words, let's hear what he has to say.

23:28.980 --> 23:33.900
An interesting character, Bernhard, because he's both before and after he started the

23:33.900 --> 23:39.500
Bilderberg, had some really disastrous things happen to him, which throw a lot of doubt

23:39.500 --> 23:40.500
over his integrity.

23:40.500 --> 23:51.020
First of all, his membership before the US entered World War II of the SS, the German

23:51.020 --> 23:52.020
SS.

23:52.020 --> 23:56.580
He then left Germany afterwards and married into the Dutch royal family, but he was in

23:56.580 --> 23:58.460
Hitler's feared SS during the war.

23:58.460 --> 24:02.340
This is the guy that started the group off, and the irony is, of course, that they will

24:02.340 --> 24:08.820
tell us that one of the reasons for the group is to stop the next or to stop any other possible

24:08.820 --> 24:10.660
Hitler surfacing in the future.

24:10.660 --> 24:14.020
Now I would have thought one of the worst people to start an organization dedicated

24:14.020 --> 24:16.740
to that task was someone who'd been in Hitler's SS.

24:16.740 --> 24:21.140
It is true that for a brief time before the war, Prince Bernhard was a member of the Reiter

24:21.140 --> 24:24.100
SS, the mounted division of the SS.

24:24.100 --> 24:29.180
This is definitely not cool, and I'm not making any kind of an excuse for it, but it's usually

24:29.180 --> 24:34.300
a good idea when you're looking at a historical figure like this to judge them based on the

24:34.300 --> 24:40.920
measure of a person's actions as opposed to a tiny, not a tiny detail, but a specific

24:40.920 --> 24:42.820
individual detail.

24:42.820 --> 24:47.140
Bernhard clearly did not support the Nazis in World War II, and he actively fought against

24:47.140 --> 24:50.340
them when Hitler invaded the Netherlands in 1940.

24:50.340 --> 24:54.660
His track record is fairly clear, and he was fighting Hitler's forces before the US even

24:54.660 --> 24:55.660
was.

24:55.660 --> 24:59.100
This is an instance of something that's a true enough fact that's being used to create

24:59.100 --> 25:01.540
a dishonest image in the listener's head.

25:01.540 --> 25:06.100
The goal is to portray that Bernhard is somebody who fought alongside the Nazis in the war,

25:06.100 --> 25:09.620
and is someone who's a part of this elite division of Hitler's organization, and that's

25:09.620 --> 25:11.000
just not true.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.300
There's more complexity to this than that.

25:14.300 --> 25:20.300
Yeah, that's got Soros's dad written all over it in that, like, fine!

25:20.300 --> 25:27.140
I get what, yes, your fundamental basic fact is correct, and by leaving out literally everything

25:27.140 --> 25:31.300
else you can support your narrative, but that's not the only fact.

25:31.300 --> 25:38.180
Yeah, and probably Prince Bernhard's a little bit less of a sympathetic figure than 14-year-old

25:38.180 --> 25:47.980
George Soros, inasmuch as he was older, and he was a member of the writing SS, but still,

25:47.980 --> 25:53.540
the totality of his actions during the war speak to somebody who was not on the side

25:53.540 --> 25:54.540
of Hitler.

25:54.540 --> 26:04.060
He's not on the side of the Nazis, and I think that at that point you can say, alright, this

26:04.060 --> 26:10.120
was a blip on your, it's a stain on your history, but it's not something that should be deterministic

26:10.120 --> 26:11.540
of your character.

26:11.540 --> 26:16.460
And that's what this guy wants to present Bernhard as, because, you know, he hates the

26:16.460 --> 26:21.860
Bilderberg group, and if one of the people who co-founded it can be just portrayed as,

26:21.860 --> 26:25.140
you know, one of Hitler's higher-ups, then there you go.

26:25.140 --> 26:26.140
Right.

26:26.140 --> 26:33.220
No, it's one of the most annoying things, because you don't, like, I don't need help

26:33.220 --> 26:35.660
being prejudiced against a prince.

26:35.660 --> 26:39.900
Like I'm fine with that, I don't like royalty.

26:39.900 --> 26:44.780
But you can't make me hate him based on bullshit, that's not fair.

26:44.780 --> 26:45.780
Also I'd like to correct myself.

26:45.780 --> 26:46.780
That's not fair.

26:46.780 --> 26:48.420
His name is Bernhard, I kept saying Barnard.

26:48.420 --> 26:50.660
I did hear Barnard, and I was like, ehhh.

26:50.660 --> 26:51.660
I don't know why.

26:51.660 --> 26:57.580
Yeah, no, I mean, I don't need help, I don't need help there, and you lying about him makes

26:57.580 --> 27:00.540
me then have to defend him, which I don't want to do.

27:00.540 --> 27:01.540
No.

27:01.540 --> 27:03.780
I don't want to defend a prince, fuck royalty.

27:03.780 --> 27:10.100
No, it makes you need to, like, be like, well hold on a second, and then secondarily it

27:10.100 --> 27:15.680
makes me very wary of whatever information you're putting out.

27:15.680 --> 27:20.700
Whatever information you have about the Bilderberg group seems kind of sketchy, if this is the

27:20.700 --> 27:23.300
level of accusation you're making.

27:23.300 --> 27:29.340
If you can't get a basic detail contextually right, then why would I believe the rest of

27:29.340 --> 27:30.340
what you have to say?

27:30.340 --> 27:31.340
Yeah.

27:31.340 --> 27:35.500
Anyway, the rest of this is just, you know, standard Bilderberg conspiracy nonsense.

27:35.500 --> 27:36.500
Sure.

27:36.500 --> 27:37.500
Gossip.

27:37.500 --> 27:38.500
Sure.

27:38.500 --> 27:40.260
And bird watching of rich people.

27:40.260 --> 27:43.500
You know, can't argue with a good bird watching.

27:43.500 --> 27:49.460
So Alex gets back to calls, and this caller is sort of relevant to my interests, and that

27:49.460 --> 27:55.600
is of course whether or not Alex was fighting the literal devil in 2003.

27:55.600 --> 27:58.460
This gives us a little hint, maybe?

27:58.460 --> 27:59.460
Wyatt Maryland.

27:59.460 --> 28:00.460
Wyatt, you're on the air.

28:00.460 --> 28:01.460
Go ahead, sir.

28:01.460 --> 28:02.460
Good afternoon, Alex.

28:02.460 --> 28:03.460
How you doing?

28:03.460 --> 28:04.460
Good, good.

28:04.460 --> 28:10.700
Boy, there's so much to talk about, and there's so little time, but all I can say is the demons

28:10.700 --> 28:15.220
are loose, and they're out, and they're doing the work.

28:15.220 --> 28:19.420
I mean, Alex doesn't have a direct response to that, but they're loose.

28:19.420 --> 28:20.420
Demons are loose.

28:20.420 --> 28:21.420
Demons are loose.

28:21.420 --> 28:24.820
I don't know what happened, but demons got loose.

28:24.820 --> 28:26.500
Who let the demons out?

28:26.500 --> 28:31.640
We had, listen, we had them in a corral in northwestern Montana.

28:31.640 --> 28:33.240
We had kept all the demons there.

28:33.240 --> 28:37.920
That's how we had developed this great nation of ours, and somebody tripped, ruined the

28:37.920 --> 28:40.220
summoning circle, and now the demons are loose.

28:40.220 --> 28:41.500
There's just nothing to do.

28:41.500 --> 28:44.840
Someone's gotta get a lasso.

28:44.840 --> 28:47.220
We gotta drive in these here demons.

28:47.220 --> 28:48.900
I think we need the regulators.

28:48.900 --> 28:53.680
I think Nate Dogg and Warren G need to mount up R.I.P.

28:53.680 --> 29:00.820
I think that this is an indication of some of the conversation that is clearly just pretty

29:00.820 --> 29:05.900
organic and natural on Alex's show at this time, talking about demons being loose and

29:05.900 --> 29:11.460
what have you, but it's still kind of a nebulous picture for me.

29:11.460 --> 29:18.820
I'm leaning more towards there being a real literalist religious vibe going on.

29:18.820 --> 29:23.900
I'm leaning closer to that, but I also don't have merely the amount of information that

29:23.900 --> 29:31.420
we do from the present that Alex legit thinks the shoot devil is there and he's pulling

29:31.420 --> 29:35.580
the strings of the enemies.

29:35.580 --> 29:39.820
This guy sounds like he definitely believes that the literal demons are loose.

29:39.820 --> 29:40.820
This dude.

29:40.820 --> 29:41.820
Yeah.

29:41.820 --> 29:42.900
They're doing work.

29:42.900 --> 29:48.520
You could still see that as a metaphor, or if you're Alex and you're responding to that,

29:48.520 --> 29:55.060
you could see that as a metaphor for the demonic impulses of the elite are given free reign

29:55.060 --> 29:58.980
now, no longer having to be corralled or moderated.

29:58.980 --> 30:00.700
Yeah, who knows?

30:00.700 --> 30:06.500
So Alex gets a lot of mileage out of people pretending that he's been right about so many

30:06.500 --> 30:09.900
things, about so many things.

30:09.900 --> 30:11.220
For 27 years.

30:11.220 --> 30:13.540
He's righter than he is wrong, and he's not.

30:13.540 --> 30:16.780
But one of the things that I thought was really fun about this next clip is he makes a bunch

30:16.780 --> 30:22.900
of predictions about gun grabbing and stuff and everything he says is wrong.

30:22.900 --> 30:23.900
Okay.

30:23.900 --> 30:29.620
They're going to reauthorize Clinton's gun ban and they're going to expand it radically.

30:29.620 --> 30:33.060
So they're going to add a semiautomatic shotgun ban.

30:33.060 --> 30:37.580
That's the NRA telling you that they're going to sign S 22, which is Patriot act two in

30:37.580 --> 30:43.320
the Senate, full of gun registration, shutting down the gun shows, national ballistics databases,

30:43.320 --> 30:48.820
the most gun control, the most hardcore draconian stuff we've ever seen.

30:48.820 --> 30:53.860
And the average conservative out there has no idea because the neo cons like rush Limbaugh,

30:53.860 --> 30:58.220
Neil boards, Michael Savage, Sean Hannity will not tell them.

30:58.220 --> 30:59.220
Wow.

30:59.220 --> 31:00.220
He likes a lot of those people.

31:00.220 --> 31:01.220
Now.

31:01.220 --> 31:02.220
Yeah.

31:02.220 --> 31:03.220
Loves them.

31:03.220 --> 31:04.220
All those predictions are wrong.

31:04.220 --> 31:05.220
I was, I was trying to keep track of him.

31:05.220 --> 31:09.140
I wrote, Nope, Nope, Nope.

31:09.140 --> 31:10.140
And also Nope.

31:10.140 --> 31:11.140
Nope.

31:11.140 --> 31:12.140
None of those happened.

31:12.140 --> 31:13.140
Yes, that is true.

31:13.140 --> 31:15.860
Um, so yeah, I mean, he's right.

31:15.860 --> 31:16.860
Most of the time.

31:16.860 --> 31:17.860
Sure.

31:17.860 --> 31:23.580
Anyway, this next clip, Alex goes back to calls and this dude, I tried to trace this

31:23.580 --> 31:24.580
down.

31:24.580 --> 31:29.580
I got very little on this, but this, this was, I enjoyed this is going to be a big swing.

31:29.580 --> 31:30.580
Hmm.

31:30.580 --> 31:31.580
Yeah.

31:31.580 --> 31:32.580
Sure.

31:32.580 --> 31:33.580
Okay.

31:33.580 --> 31:34.580
Tom and Texas.

31:34.580 --> 31:35.580
You're on the air.

31:35.580 --> 31:36.580
Go ahead, sir.

31:36.580 --> 31:37.580
Yeah.

31:37.580 --> 31:38.580
You're on the air.

31:38.580 --> 31:39.580
Go ahead.

31:39.580 --> 31:40.580
Yes, sir.

31:40.580 --> 31:47.380
I, I first informed, uh, Tex Mars in, uh, 1988 about the, uh, the church, the hidden

31:47.380 --> 31:54.460
church over there on highway six, uh, about, uh, as an area and as a moment, I was in work

31:54.460 --> 31:57.700
with you all movies world, sir, I really don't understand what you're saying or have to give

31:57.700 --> 31:58.700
us some background.

31:58.700 --> 32:05.900
I do not understand this and I want to know, tell me about the hidden church on route six.

32:05.900 --> 32:09.140
Well, thankfully Alex does ask for clarification and here it comes.

32:09.140 --> 32:15.260
Okay, the background is, uh, I went to this church that we moved pews out of and the old

32:15.260 --> 32:18.220
man walked out cussing like a sailor cause we got there late.

32:18.220 --> 32:20.460
He said, you realize who's church this is?

32:20.460 --> 32:21.460
I said, no.

32:21.460 --> 32:25.900
He said, this is George Bush's church, but we walked in and had a big swatch to go hanging

32:25.900 --> 32:33.000
down and up above the pulpit and I said, well, okay, well tell me all about, he has the Christian

32:33.000 --> 32:36.980
symbol up there, you said, and it's, and he showed me all the pictures in the offices

32:36.980 --> 32:39.500
of the Bush family.

32:39.500 --> 32:45.140
So about, I guess two weeks later, I went and told Tex Mars about it at a convention

32:45.140 --> 32:46.480
at the hobby airport.

32:46.480 --> 32:50.420
So first of all, this dude worked for a moving company and he was called to show up at a

32:50.420 --> 32:54.980
backwards hidden church to remove pews, but somehow the only person there hadn't called

32:54.980 --> 32:57.580
them to move the furniture and was confused that they were there.

32:57.580 --> 32:58.580
Correct.

32:58.580 --> 32:59.580
This is a little fishy.

32:59.580 --> 33:00.580
No.

33:00.580 --> 33:02.100
My second issue is that this was in 1988.

33:02.100 --> 33:06.380
So at this point, George H.W. Bush was coming to the end of his second term as vice president

33:06.380 --> 33:09.020
and was about to win the 1988 election for president.

33:09.020 --> 33:13.820
He still flew back to Texas every Sunday to go to the hidden church on Route 6, everybody

33:13.820 --> 33:14.820
knows that.

33:14.820 --> 33:19.100
George W. Bush hadn't even become Texas governor yet and honestly, he hadn't even bought the

33:19.100 --> 33:21.100
Texas Rangers at this point.

33:21.100 --> 33:24.420
I don't see how the either, it would be in either of their interests to be running a

33:24.420 --> 33:28.180
secret Nazi church in the middle of Texas when they were spending most of their time

33:28.180 --> 33:31.780
at this point in DC and campaigning.

33:31.780 --> 33:35.500
I am the vice president of the United States.

33:35.500 --> 33:36.620
And have been for years.

33:36.620 --> 33:43.420
One of the most looked at, observed, and known where a person is at all times.

33:43.420 --> 33:44.420
People you can be.

33:44.420 --> 33:46.220
Almost like there's a schedule that's public.

33:46.220 --> 33:47.620
That's public.

33:47.620 --> 33:49.480
Every day.

33:49.480 --> 33:54.460
But on Sundays, flies back to Texas, heads to the hidden Nazi church.

33:54.460 --> 33:56.380
No one knows about it.

33:56.380 --> 34:00.740
Except for this guy, the U-Haul mover who accidentally showed up there or something.

34:00.740 --> 34:04.180
And there are hidden pictures of the, okay, okay.

34:04.180 --> 34:10.820
So you're telling me, you're telling me that this moving company shows up, the guy is cussing

34:10.820 --> 34:13.300
like a sailor, says, do you know whose church this is?

34:13.300 --> 34:14.760
This is the Bush's church.

34:14.760 --> 34:20.160
And then that aggressive attitude wipes away and he's like, come on back into the office.

34:20.160 --> 34:21.900
Let me show you George Bush and the Nazis.

34:21.900 --> 34:26.540
And no one will ever find these pictures despite the fact that this guy seems willing to show

34:26.540 --> 34:28.900
them to literally anybody who walks in.

34:28.900 --> 34:29.900
Yeah, yeah.

34:29.900 --> 34:32.420
He seems, seems to be real neighborly.

34:32.420 --> 34:38.380
Hey, hey, this is the hidden church on route six.

34:38.380 --> 34:39.380
Come on in.

34:39.380 --> 34:41.500
Let me show you the vice president's Nazi memorabilia.

34:41.500 --> 34:46.980
Well, you know, I work for George H.W. Bush and he specifically told me when he left that

34:46.980 --> 34:50.420
while I was watching over the place, I was to tell everybody.

34:50.420 --> 34:52.960
Let everybody know.

34:52.960 --> 34:55.940
Be sure you show the pictures of me and my family.

34:55.940 --> 34:59.100
Yes, I want this information getting out.

34:59.100 --> 35:01.340
That's why I go to this hidden church.

35:01.340 --> 35:02.460
Ridiculous.

35:02.460 --> 35:07.660
Also, Tex Mars is a extreme anti-Semite.

35:07.660 --> 35:11.400
So yeah, it's not good that this guy felt like, hey, first person I got to get this

35:11.400 --> 35:12.400
information to.

35:12.400 --> 35:13.400
Yeah.

35:13.400 --> 35:14.400
Yeah.

35:14.400 --> 35:15.400
Not good.

35:15.400 --> 35:16.400
No.

35:16.400 --> 35:17.400
So Alex wants to know where this church is.

35:17.400 --> 35:18.400
Yes.

35:18.400 --> 35:19.400
Because that is an important question.

35:19.400 --> 35:21.400
Now, where is this church, sir?

35:21.400 --> 35:23.260
That was the problem.

35:23.260 --> 35:28.700
Now, when I told Tex Mars, he wrote about me in his book, Hidden Days of the Rainbow.

35:28.700 --> 35:30.020
I'm the one that informed him about it.

35:30.020 --> 35:32.180
He didn't know nothing about it.

35:32.180 --> 35:34.820
And he found it to be true.

35:34.820 --> 35:35.820
Where is this church, sir?

35:35.820 --> 35:36.820
Okay.

35:36.820 --> 35:37.820
It was on Highway 6.

35:37.820 --> 35:38.820
Best I can remember.

35:38.820 --> 35:39.820
This is in 88.

35:39.820 --> 35:41.820
I'll have to do some more investigation.

35:41.820 --> 35:42.820
Outside where?

35:42.820 --> 35:43.820
Right outside.

35:43.820 --> 35:49.340
It's close to, I'd say going out past Sugar Land.

35:49.340 --> 35:50.340
Outside Houston.

35:50.340 --> 35:51.340
Right.

35:51.340 --> 35:53.340
It's on the east side of Houston.

35:53.340 --> 35:55.620
I mean, the west side of Houston.

35:55.620 --> 35:59.860
Look, man, if you find the vice president's Nazi church, you will forget.

35:59.860 --> 36:02.860
Just know where the vice president's Nazi church is.

36:02.860 --> 36:04.780
You will drive people by.

36:04.780 --> 36:05.780
It's pretty big.

36:05.780 --> 36:06.780
Yeah.

36:06.780 --> 36:07.780
It's a pretty big thing.

36:07.780 --> 36:10.460
No, I would find ways.

36:10.460 --> 36:14.440
I would be like, hey, look, the main highway has been torn down.

36:14.440 --> 36:17.820
We're going to have to take the long way through Highway 6.

36:17.820 --> 36:24.300
Oh, by the way, I met George Bush's Nazi pastor and he's got pictures of George Bush with

36:24.300 --> 36:25.300
the Nazi bullshit.

36:25.300 --> 36:29.900
I find it difficult to believe that if you did find something like this, you wouldn't

36:29.900 --> 36:31.100
go back yourself.

36:31.100 --> 36:32.100
All the time.

36:32.100 --> 36:33.100
Not all the time.

36:33.100 --> 36:34.100
Not all the time.

36:34.100 --> 36:37.100
But at least you'd go back and be like, did I really see what I thought I saw?

36:37.100 --> 36:38.100
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:38.100 --> 36:39.420
No, this is Brigadoon.

36:39.420 --> 36:40.420
It's outrageous.

36:40.420 --> 36:41.420
Yeah.

36:41.420 --> 36:47.100
So anyway, this church, I want to ask you how you're picturing this.

36:47.100 --> 36:48.180
How big is it?

36:48.180 --> 36:50.440
What are you imagining?

36:50.440 --> 36:52.740
Give me some physical attributes that you're-

36:52.740 --> 36:57.780
All right, I see it seating maybe 60 to 80 people.

36:57.780 --> 36:58.780
There are about-

36:58.780 --> 37:00.260
So it's kind of a smaller congregation.

37:00.260 --> 37:01.900
Kind of a smaller congregation.

37:01.900 --> 37:05.260
There's two rows of pews on either side with a walkway there.

37:05.260 --> 37:11.940
There's a pulpit and directly behind it hanging is a, let's call it 20 foot tall Nazi flag

37:11.940 --> 37:13.460
based on his description.

37:13.460 --> 37:17.220
Do you think that it's a place that's in good repair?

37:17.220 --> 37:19.660
Do you think it's something that's dilapidated?

37:19.660 --> 37:20.660
What are your feelings on this?

37:20.660 --> 37:26.540
I think it has to have that feel of being absurdly clean for the area that it's in.

37:26.540 --> 37:32.740
Like the walls are painted absurdly white, almost as if they're immune to the nature

37:32.740 --> 37:33.740
around them.

37:33.740 --> 37:37.380
So it's like an OR, like an operating room in the middle of a swamp.

37:37.380 --> 37:38.580
Yes, absolutely.

37:38.580 --> 37:39.580
Okay.

37:39.580 --> 37:42.740
That is an interesting picture and I think that's probably about what I thought.

37:42.740 --> 37:43.740
We're both wrong.

37:43.740 --> 37:44.740
Okay.

37:44.740 --> 37:46.340
How many people would you say the church would see?

37:46.340 --> 37:47.340
7,000.

37:47.340 --> 37:52.260
Probably at least 800 at the least.

37:52.260 --> 37:53.260
That's a lot.

37:53.260 --> 37:54.260
It's real organized.

37:54.260 --> 37:56.260
That's a lot of people who know George Bush is a Nazi.

37:56.260 --> 38:02.260
I mean, the whole family was in there, they had the Bushes, the kids, the whole nine yards

38:02.260 --> 38:03.260
in there.

38:03.260 --> 38:06.940
He says, I said, well, I can't believe this is Bushes.

38:06.940 --> 38:11.180
He said, man, this is the God, God, this is the true church of God here.

38:11.180 --> 38:13.460
And he said it was a branch from the Abyscapelian.

38:13.460 --> 38:19.780
I do remember him saying that, a branch away from the Abyscapelian.

38:19.780 --> 38:24.020
Sir, I appreciate your call, Tom, appreciate it.

38:24.020 --> 38:28.060
But look, that is not how I know the global is to operate.

38:28.060 --> 38:32.140
It's an armored fortress at the Skull and Bones tomb and that kind of stuff is in there.

38:32.140 --> 38:33.140
That's confirmed.

38:33.140 --> 38:38.180
It's guarded at Bohemian Grove and there is that type of stuff.

38:38.180 --> 38:39.420
I don't know that story, sir.

38:39.420 --> 38:45.580
I really, I don't like to speculate on, so, you know, I'm not saying you're a liar.

38:45.580 --> 38:47.020
It just, it just doesn't, doesn't fit.

38:47.020 --> 38:49.900
It fits with some stuff but not in other areas.

38:49.900 --> 38:52.620
I'm so proud of Alex.

38:52.620 --> 38:57.220
That's one of the few points that I've ever heard him be like, I can't accept this.

38:57.220 --> 38:59.140
Yeah, that is, that is intense.

38:59.140 --> 39:00.140
Yeah.

39:00.140 --> 39:03.940
How great would it be to be like, I'm on the phone with the person who found George W. Bush's

39:03.940 --> 39:04.940
Nazi church.

39:04.940 --> 39:07.980
And he's like, I can't make this fit.

39:07.980 --> 39:08.980
This is no good.

39:08.980 --> 39:09.980
No, sir.

39:09.980 --> 39:10.980
Look, this just doesn't match.

39:10.980 --> 39:11.980
Yeah.

39:11.980 --> 39:12.980
Sorry.

39:12.980 --> 39:15.060
I'm not calling you a liar, but I don't know about this.

39:15.060 --> 39:16.060
Yeah.

39:16.060 --> 39:20.380
That's, that's a, that is a level of pushback I rarely see from him.

39:20.380 --> 39:21.380
That's true.

39:21.380 --> 39:26.620
But I mean, at the same time, his pushback is not based around like, that's ridiculous

39:26.620 --> 39:32.360
so much as it is like, okay, I get you think there's a Nazi base on the moon, but it's

39:32.360 --> 39:33.360
on Mars.

39:33.360 --> 39:34.360
Duh.

39:34.360 --> 39:36.900
I can't accept this Nazi base on the moon.

39:36.900 --> 39:39.520
Whatever my Nazi base is on Mars, man.

39:39.520 --> 39:43.780
I have to actually push back on what you're saying because I think that that's not fair.

39:43.780 --> 39:47.940
I think that what Alex is saying, the reason that he's, he's pushing back on this guy is

39:47.940 --> 39:53.700
because he's saying there are little Nazi enclaves and, and, and like worship centers

39:53.700 --> 39:54.700
or whatever.

39:54.700 --> 39:55.700
Yeah, of course.

39:55.700 --> 39:56.700
But they're heavily armed.

39:56.700 --> 39:57.700
Yes.

39:57.700 --> 40:01.420
That's like, you, you can't get into the skull and bones area where there's the big Nazi

40:01.420 --> 40:02.420
flag.

40:02.420 --> 40:03.420
Right.

40:03.420 --> 40:05.860
There's not going to be one out in the middle of like at this church that you get welcomed

40:05.860 --> 40:06.860
into.

40:06.860 --> 40:11.380
And it's not, it's not that it's like, okay, it's on the moon or on Mars.

40:11.380 --> 40:14.820
It's the context surrounding this doesn't make sense.

40:14.820 --> 40:15.820
I understand.

40:15.820 --> 40:19.780
This would not be that easy to accidentally stumble into.

40:19.780 --> 40:21.760
I broke into Bohemian Grove.

40:21.760 --> 40:23.480
That's how I know their things.

40:23.480 --> 40:24.980
You didn't break into this church.

40:24.980 --> 40:31.060
No, you were welcomed in by a, and that would never happen, a surprisingly neighborly Nazi.

40:31.060 --> 40:32.060
Right.

40:32.060 --> 40:37.500
Because his narratives require that it's hard to find these secrets.

40:37.500 --> 40:38.500
True.

40:38.500 --> 40:39.500
True.

40:39.500 --> 40:40.500
And so that's why he's pushing back.

40:40.500 --> 40:44.820
But I still think that it's at least, I mean, functionally, it serves the same purpose as

40:44.820 --> 40:46.140
saying that this is ridiculous.

40:46.140 --> 40:47.140
Sure.

40:47.140 --> 40:48.360
No, that's, that's definitely true.

40:48.360 --> 40:49.360
That's definitely true.

40:49.360 --> 40:54.520
And he, I mean, I assume it would feel like a bit of a personal attack on his manhood

40:54.520 --> 40:58.840
if you just got to get secrets by walking into places.

40:58.840 --> 41:02.180
And then potentially bigger scoop than Bohemian Grove.

41:02.180 --> 41:03.180
Exactly.

41:03.180 --> 41:05.980
Just by accidentally showing up with a U-Haul truck.

41:05.980 --> 41:09.780
I think it would just be so much easier to be like, really seats 800, huh?

41:09.780 --> 41:10.780
Wow.

41:10.780 --> 41:17.100
So there's, there's a, what, 768 people who know that the entire Bush family is Nazis?

41:17.100 --> 41:18.100
No, no, no.

41:18.100 --> 41:19.100
Here's what you don't know.

41:19.100 --> 41:21.420
There's 800 Bush family members.

41:21.420 --> 41:24.300
Now that might as well be your, your angle on it.

41:24.300 --> 41:25.300
Sure.

41:25.300 --> 41:27.860
It's the only Bush church there's ever been.

41:27.860 --> 41:28.860
Yeah.

41:28.860 --> 41:32.860
So here's, here's our last clip from the 22nd.

41:32.860 --> 41:38.180
Alex is talking about the situation in Iraq, and he's saying that, about to confiscate

41:38.180 --> 41:40.660
weapons from people.

41:40.660 --> 41:43.740
Allies to begin seizing weapons from most Iraqis.

41:43.740 --> 41:47.420
Iraqi citizens will be required to turn over automatic weapons and heavy weapons under

41:47.420 --> 41:51.060
a proclamation that allied authorities plan to issue this week.

41:51.060 --> 41:54.900
Allied officials of the day, the aim of the proclamation is to help stabilize Iraq by

41:54.900 --> 41:59.180
confiscating a huge supply of AK-47 machine guns, buck repelled grenades, and other weapons

41:59.180 --> 42:02.540
that are used by criminal gangs, paramilitary groups, and remnants of the Saddam Hussein's

42:02.540 --> 42:03.540
government.

42:03.540 --> 42:08.180
Well, the remnants of Saddam Hussein's government, we've got the names, the Ba'ath Party's being

42:08.180 --> 42:09.680
put back into control.

42:09.680 --> 42:17.060
So Alex still thinks on the 22nd of May that the Ba'ath Party is being put back into power

42:17.060 --> 42:19.540
and it's all a CIA operation.

42:19.540 --> 42:23.140
Isn't he reading about how they're confiscating the Ba'ath Party's weapons?

42:23.140 --> 42:31.300
Well, I mean, I think that, I have to assume that he just thinks that that's window dressing

42:31.300 --> 42:32.300
or cover or something.

42:32.300 --> 42:33.300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:33.300 --> 42:36.860
That way people won't suspect that the Ba'ath Party is still running things.

42:36.860 --> 42:37.860
Right, right.

42:37.860 --> 42:38.860
Yeah, yeah.

42:38.860 --> 42:43.260
So I still think that we have not reached a point where this is interesting.

42:43.260 --> 42:49.300
It's still sort of rising, it's crescendoing reality, and Alex just...

42:49.300 --> 42:50.300
They're on a collision course.

42:50.300 --> 42:51.300
Head on.

42:51.300 --> 42:52.300
Head on collision.

42:52.300 --> 42:54.820
Two trains traveling directly at each other.

42:54.820 --> 43:01.700
And I'm very interested to see how that, how Alex tries to veer around that, that looming

43:01.700 --> 43:02.700
accident.

43:02.700 --> 43:07.340
It does have the feel of two trains riding straight towards each other and one train

43:07.340 --> 43:13.220
is like, ooh, I can't hit reality, so I'm going to turn off, and then it hits a bus.

43:13.220 --> 43:14.720
You're like, way to go.

43:14.720 --> 43:21.780
So a large portion of this episode on the 23rd is Alex talking to this Belgian doctor,

43:21.780 --> 43:22.780
Dr. Van Martyr.

43:22.780 --> 43:23.780
Okay.

43:23.780 --> 43:24.780
Mortyr?

43:24.780 --> 43:25.780
Martyr?

43:25.780 --> 43:26.780
I'm not entirely sure.

43:26.780 --> 43:27.780
That's a good name.

43:27.780 --> 43:32.100
He's a dude who witnessed crimes being committed by our military against Iraqi civilians, and

43:32.100 --> 43:37.860
there's talk of bringing charges against military leaders in foreign courts.

43:37.860 --> 43:38.860
Yeah.

43:38.860 --> 43:39.860
That would be nice.

43:39.860 --> 43:42.820
I have little problem with this interview as a whole.

43:42.820 --> 43:48.420
I think that this guy is bringing up some fine points, but also it's not a very good

43:48.420 --> 43:49.420
interview.

43:49.420 --> 43:55.460
I think I don't think that Alex really gets to too many of the more important issues.

43:55.460 --> 44:00.540
It seems like he's doing a bit of grandstanding and what have you, and I just think that this

44:00.540 --> 44:04.620
subject matter is covered better by almost anybody else.

44:04.620 --> 44:11.140
Even in 2003, there were much better commentators that you could find discussing human rights

44:11.140 --> 44:16.660
abuses on the part of our military in Iraq, but at the same time, I'm not going to sit

44:16.660 --> 44:23.440
and nitpick, because it's mostly this dude talking, and his perspective is like, he saw

44:23.440 --> 44:28.540
some US soldiers shooting at an ambulance, and like, yeah, that sucks.

44:28.540 --> 44:31.260
Yeah, that's a war crime.

44:31.260 --> 44:36.700
So would you say that this interview is Alex letting somebody give legitimate criticisms

44:36.700 --> 44:43.740
of the US military in order for him to be like, see, the military and the government

44:43.740 --> 44:47.740
is all evil, despite not actually giving a shit about the war crimes, and just kind of

44:47.740 --> 44:49.860
exploiting that the government is evil?

44:49.860 --> 44:54.720
Somewhat, and then also using it to translate into, like, they're going to start a police

44:54.720 --> 44:55.720
state here.

44:55.720 --> 44:56.720
Sure, sure.

44:56.720 --> 45:03.980
And so I don't think that his use of this stuff is great, but I also think, like...

45:03.980 --> 45:06.120
Yeah, the US commits war crimes.

45:06.120 --> 45:07.120
We got it.

45:07.120 --> 45:08.120
Yeah, it's...

45:08.120 --> 45:09.580
We should do something about it now, soon.

45:09.580 --> 45:10.580
It's hard to lose...

45:10.580 --> 45:12.120
In 2003.

45:12.120 --> 45:13.440
It's really weird to me.

45:13.440 --> 45:21.260
It's really weird to remember 2003 and hear that Alex was having a Belgian doctor on to

45:21.260 --> 45:23.820
reveal US war crimes and was not...

45:23.820 --> 45:28.580
Like, because I remember how bloodthirsty everybody was.

45:28.580 --> 45:31.700
Everybody was so fucking bloodthirsty.

45:31.700 --> 45:36.500
If you went on TV and said like, hey, the American government is committing war crimes,

45:36.500 --> 45:41.420
there would be another talking head being like, that's the cost of war, you know?

45:41.420 --> 45:45.820
And people would agree, yes, sometimes you have to commit war crimes.

45:45.820 --> 45:52.980
To fucking have to live in a world where unfortunately, despite his exploitative nature, Alex was

45:52.980 --> 45:59.180
one of the few people putting on an agreement fest about the US committing war crimes is

45:59.180 --> 46:00.180
wild.

46:00.180 --> 46:01.180
Yeah, yeah.

46:01.180 --> 46:02.180
It is.

46:02.180 --> 46:03.180
Yeah, it is.

46:03.180 --> 46:04.180
Sorry, I just needed to observe that.

46:04.180 --> 46:08.740
That just feels like really strange to live in both the present and the past at the same

46:08.740 --> 46:09.740
time.

46:09.740 --> 46:14.140
And it's worth pointing out, I don't think it's worth discussing this interview like

46:14.140 --> 46:20.220
actual clips of it, but it is worth bringing up that that is a reality.

46:20.220 --> 46:28.060
And again, I think you can say hooray to an extent to him for that.

46:28.060 --> 46:33.260
But there's still other voices that exist that were talking about these things, and

46:33.260 --> 46:39.060
they weren't doing things like the other things that Alex is doing.

46:39.060 --> 46:43.860
And one of those things is hanging out with fucking shitheads and talking about Bilderberg.

46:43.860 --> 46:44.860
Yeah.

46:44.860 --> 46:49.740
I mean, just in the context of that, it is kind of something that I think about a lot

46:49.740 --> 46:57.420
just because that's part of how Alex got to where he got to, is that there were shit tons

46:57.420 --> 47:04.720
of war crimes going on, and because this is correct, you are sucked into the rest of his

47:04.720 --> 47:11.160
bullshit until he just gets rid of even any pretense of giving a shit about war crimes,

47:11.160 --> 47:15.680
and then you're trapped in this place of, neither do I, you know?

47:15.680 --> 47:16.680
It's weird.

47:16.680 --> 47:18.820
Yeah, it is weird.

47:18.820 --> 47:22.160
And the things that he cares about more aren't those things.

47:22.160 --> 47:23.160
They aren't...

47:23.160 --> 47:24.160
Exactly.

47:24.160 --> 47:27.540
They aren't issues that he cares about for the sake of them.

47:27.540 --> 47:29.860
He cares about them as a means.

47:29.860 --> 47:30.860
Yeah.

47:30.860 --> 47:35.920
And it's an important thing to point out that one of the big reasons that we are here where

47:35.920 --> 47:43.300
propagandists can destroy everything is that cyclical nature between a corrupt war crime

47:43.300 --> 47:49.120
committing government and a propaganda outlet who's creating that like, yeah, you can't

47:49.120 --> 47:53.820
trust these war crime committing people for good reasons until it spirals out of control,

47:53.820 --> 47:56.980
and now you can't trust anybody or anything.

47:56.980 --> 47:58.160
Yeah, I'm sorry.

47:58.160 --> 48:00.700
I got lost on a tangent there.

48:00.700 --> 48:01.700
Apologies.

48:01.700 --> 48:02.700
Apologies.

48:02.700 --> 48:03.700
No worries.

48:03.700 --> 48:06.900
So one of the things that Alex does care more about, one of the things that's really consistent,

48:06.900 --> 48:09.140
like I said, is that Bilderberg shit.

48:09.140 --> 48:16.580
And so he had that guy, Tony Gosling, on the 22nd talk about Bilderberg, and if you go

48:16.580 --> 48:19.180
check out his website, he has some iffy opinions.

48:19.180 --> 48:22.580
I would like Alex to put his top 30 movies on the Info Wars website.

48:22.580 --> 48:23.580
I don't.

48:23.580 --> 48:24.580
Okay.

48:24.580 --> 48:25.940
I think it would all just be...

48:25.940 --> 48:28.140
Oblivion 1 through 30.

48:28.140 --> 48:29.140
Yeah.

48:29.140 --> 48:31.940
Yeah, Life's a Movie, man.

48:31.940 --> 48:35.540
So he has another expert on the 23rd, and that's big Jim Tucker, baby.

48:35.540 --> 48:42.900
Well, I spent 20 years with the establishment press, with Washington Daily News, Akron,

48:42.900 --> 48:49.820
Beacon, Journal, Richmond Times, This Statch, other newspapers, until 1975 when I was being

48:49.820 --> 48:55.300
interviewed by Willis Carter at Liberty Lobby for the position of editor of a newspaper

48:55.300 --> 48:58.180
he was getting ready to create called The Spotlight.

48:58.180 --> 49:02.220
He asked me what I thought about Bilderberg, and I said, who are they, and he gave me a

49:02.220 --> 49:03.220
brief description.

49:03.220 --> 49:04.220
I said, that's impossible.

49:04.220 --> 49:06.740
I've been with newspapers all my life.

49:06.740 --> 49:09.140
Such a group could not exist without me knowing.

49:09.140 --> 49:11.960
Willis Cardo is a Nazi and white supremacist.

49:11.960 --> 49:16.780
The Spectator was a paper whose editorial position was anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial.

49:16.780 --> 49:19.500
Jim Tucker was the editor of that paper.

49:19.500 --> 49:23.240
In case you've forgotten since we talked about him in our Endgame coverage, here's one of

49:23.240 --> 49:25.340
Willis Cardo's famous quotes.

49:25.340 --> 49:31.060
Quote, if Satan himself, with all of his superhuman genius and diabolical ingenuity at his command,

49:31.060 --> 49:35.900
had tried to create a permanent disintegration and force for the destruction of the nations,

49:35.900 --> 49:39.780
he could have done no better than invent the Jews.

49:39.780 --> 49:44.660
Describing his motivation to start The Spotlight, the ADL says in a bio of Cardo, quote, Cardo's

49:44.660 --> 49:48.640
chief aim was always to mobilize opinion against Jews.

49:48.640 --> 49:52.220
Liberty Lobby was his chief instrument to bridge right-wing constituencies.

49:52.220 --> 49:57.780
Hard-right or paramilitary libertarians, conspiratorial anti-communists, racists by inflaming their

49:57.780 --> 50:02.980
anti-government and nativist fears and identifying Jews as the country's chief threat.

50:02.980 --> 50:06.900
Willis Cardo is a bigot who wanted to sway public opinion against Jews with his media

50:06.900 --> 50:07.900
entities.

50:07.900 --> 50:12.940
And Jim Tucker worked for his big media entity from its beginning in 1975 until they folded

50:12.940 --> 50:14.720
in 2001.

50:14.720 --> 50:18.020
Fuck him and fuck whatever he has to say about Bilderberg.

50:18.020 --> 50:23.100
It's even more insulting that he didn't know about them until Willis Cardo told him about

50:23.100 --> 50:24.100
them.

50:24.100 --> 50:25.100
God damn.

50:25.100 --> 50:26.100
Yeah.

50:26.100 --> 50:27.220
One of the worst.

50:27.220 --> 50:28.220
Fuck Jim Tucker.

50:28.220 --> 50:34.140
Yeah, it makes you want to invent a bow and arrow that can shoot arrows into the past.

50:34.140 --> 50:37.460
One of the things that's really funny to me though is like, Alex is like, oh yeah, Jim

50:37.460 --> 50:40.940
Tucker, you know, you climb fences and get in there.

50:40.940 --> 50:42.220
He's a real intrepid journalist.

50:42.220 --> 50:47.460
And then like you look at the videos of Jim Tucker and he's always drunk and smoking at

50:47.460 --> 50:48.460
cigarettes.

50:48.460 --> 50:52.660
I was going to say, yeah, this is not a man, he's the guy who was wearing the hat all the

50:52.660 --> 50:53.660
time too.

50:53.660 --> 50:59.740
I was like, that is not a man who can jump a fence without severely injuring himself.

50:59.740 --> 51:04.180
He seems like he's exhausted reading a paper.

51:04.180 --> 51:06.820
Or at the very least continuing to breathe.

51:06.820 --> 51:07.820
Yeah.

51:07.820 --> 51:12.940
So anyway, Alex talks to Jim Tucker and it's all just the same shit except without the

51:12.940 --> 51:16.980
excitement at seeing David Rockefeller, the Tony Gosling guy.

51:16.980 --> 51:18.740
We don't have the fanboy moment.

51:18.740 --> 51:23.140
But one of the things that I think is worth pointing out about both of these interviews

51:23.140 --> 51:30.860
is that Jim Tucker is somebody who I don't know and I don't care what his personal positions

51:30.860 --> 51:31.860
are.

51:31.860 --> 51:39.540
He was the editor of a fucking white supremacist Holocaust denial paper for 25 years.

51:39.540 --> 51:43.780
And Tony Gosling has a lot of questions about who is or is not Jewish and thinks a lot of

51:43.780 --> 51:47.640
the problems in the world come from Jews not accepting Jesus as the Messiah.

51:47.640 --> 51:49.060
Seems like it.

51:49.060 --> 51:52.380
You wouldn't know that from listening to their interviews.

51:52.380 --> 51:53.740
You wouldn't know that.

51:53.740 --> 51:59.520
You would think that these guys are concerned about politics and really powerful people

51:59.520 --> 52:02.240
getting together and talking behind closed doors.

52:02.240 --> 52:07.980
You would think that, hey, these are just guys who have a political position that maybe

52:07.980 --> 52:12.160
is anathema with what the media wants to report.

52:12.160 --> 52:17.260
You wouldn't know that maybe a lot of antisemitism is what drives.

52:17.260 --> 52:18.260
Yeah.

52:18.260 --> 52:26.180
You know, a lot of people don't sympathize with Nazis as much.

52:26.180 --> 52:31.020
But what you got to understand is you used to be able to just tell people that you hated

52:31.020 --> 52:32.780
the Jews all the time.

52:32.780 --> 52:37.260
And now you have to hide behind all of these things, you know, like that's hard.

52:37.260 --> 52:39.520
Let's just think about the Nazis for a second.

52:39.520 --> 52:45.960
Now they can't even say openly on the radio that everyone should kill the Jews because

52:45.960 --> 52:47.060
it's their fault.

52:47.060 --> 52:48.060
It's brutal.

52:48.060 --> 52:49.060
Poor Willis.

52:49.060 --> 52:50.060
Poor Willis.

52:50.060 --> 52:54.580
Anyway, we go to the 27th because most of this show is just that interview with Jim

52:54.580 --> 52:58.060
Tucker and then the interview with the Belgian doctor.

52:58.060 --> 53:06.420
And like I said, the discussion of mistreatment of Iraqis and all that is fine and it's good.

53:06.420 --> 53:11.500
It's something that there was probably, I don't even know if probably is the right word,

53:11.500 --> 53:18.020
I would say definitely, there should have been more space for in public conversation.

53:18.020 --> 53:24.920
But one of the reasons that I find it kind of not that interesting or not that relevant

53:24.920 --> 53:31.000
to give Alex too much of a pat on the head about it is he takes these stories and he

53:31.000 --> 53:37.380
discusses or reads headlines about mistreatment of people in Iraq, the civilians, and then

53:37.380 --> 53:40.740
he just makes it about himself and the United States.

53:40.740 --> 53:41.740
Naturally.

53:41.740 --> 53:45.540
This is so horrible and it's only going to get worse.

53:45.540 --> 53:53.500
And MSNBC reported before the war plans for reeducation centers.

53:53.500 --> 54:01.380
Marine centers, movie screens, blaring propaganda, machine gun nests, everything.

54:01.380 --> 54:03.980
This is so embarrassing.

54:03.980 --> 54:08.820
But again, Europe controls America, is using us as the bad cop right now, they own our

54:08.820 --> 54:12.380
full reserve, they've ordered the dollar to be imploded.

54:12.380 --> 54:18.180
So again, none of that came to pass here as he's suggesting.

54:18.180 --> 54:23.300
He's covering here, this is on the 27th now, we've jumped to that Tuesday, and he's covering

54:23.300 --> 54:29.780
conversation about Guantanamo, about the possibility of military tribunals taking place there.

54:29.780 --> 54:36.100
And now he's saying that they had plans before the war for here in America to have these

54:36.100 --> 54:39.860
detention centers and machine gun nests.

54:39.860 --> 54:48.340
It's all the conversation about the wrongs of the war exist in order to facilitate his

54:48.340 --> 54:51.860
narratives about his fears about what's going to happen here.

54:51.860 --> 54:53.780
It's not on its own merits.

54:53.780 --> 54:59.660
The people there, their pain and what's being done isn't wrong because it's wrong.

54:59.660 --> 55:01.780
And I have a difficulty with that.

55:01.780 --> 55:02.780
Yeah.

55:02.780 --> 55:05.200
I mean, you know, it's tough.

55:05.200 --> 55:13.080
The good thing is that, if I recall correctly, in 2008, Obama fulfilled his campaign promise

55:13.080 --> 55:15.260
to close Guantanamo Bay, right?

55:15.260 --> 55:18.820
That was like one of the first things he did.

55:18.820 --> 55:21.980
But Dan, I'm...

55:21.980 --> 55:27.620
So Alex goes to calls, and one of the things that he's been pretty upset about is seat

55:27.620 --> 55:31.540
belt checks.

55:31.540 --> 55:36.060
I really, really don't know.

55:36.060 --> 55:41.940
He's not a fan of click it or tick it.

55:41.940 --> 55:50.660
The devil with all of his might is arrayed against us, and I can't stand a $70 ticket.

55:50.660 --> 55:56.700
So he's talking here, another instance of him being totally right about his predictions

55:56.700 --> 55:57.700
of what would...

55:57.700 --> 55:59.140
So the seat belt checks.

55:59.140 --> 56:00.140
Yes.

56:00.140 --> 56:01.140
It's going to get out of control.

56:01.140 --> 56:02.140
It's going to get out of control.

56:02.140 --> 56:03.140
Okay.

56:03.140 --> 56:04.140
It was, we then learned the name of it.

56:04.140 --> 56:10.160
It was the National Seat Belt Use Initiative funded by Clinton to the tune of over $4 billion

56:10.160 --> 56:12.620
a year.

56:12.620 --> 56:15.620
Started at 2.4, and then it phased in over to $4 billion a year.

56:15.620 --> 56:17.220
Bush is funding it.

56:17.220 --> 56:23.840
It's going to build internal checkpoints that will also serve as toll booths to fund it.

56:23.840 --> 56:26.140
It will be the equivalent of airport screening.

56:26.140 --> 56:27.140
You'll be harassed.

56:27.140 --> 56:28.260
You'll be searched.

56:28.260 --> 56:29.940
That's why they don't care if you refuse to fly.

56:29.940 --> 56:36.340
You're going to go through it at the checkpoints, and it says, citizens will wear gray uniforms,

56:36.340 --> 56:38.380
part three of the four-part plan.

56:38.380 --> 56:40.440
Citizens will wear gray uniforms.

56:40.440 --> 56:42.660
That will be a national draft, compulsory draft.

56:42.660 --> 56:44.900
You will have to serve in Homeland Security.

56:44.900 --> 56:47.420
It will be high school students to be able to graduate.

56:47.420 --> 56:49.660
They will be searching you at checkpoints.

56:49.660 --> 56:54.580
The Philadelphia Inquirer reported last year that the kids are training with M-16s.

56:54.580 --> 57:00.620
They're training in warrant service, checkpoints, fugitive apprehension, building clearing.

57:00.620 --> 57:07.740
It is going to be throngs of power-tripping citizens with submachine guns.

57:07.740 --> 57:08.740
It's a nightmare world, sir.

57:08.740 --> 57:09.740
How does it sound to you?

57:09.740 --> 57:10.740
I don't know.

57:10.740 --> 57:11.740
I don't think this happened.

57:11.740 --> 57:21.100
But, you know, one of the things that's wild is, like, you go back to 2003, and the world

57:21.100 --> 57:28.500
was so, like, topsy-turvy because of the aftermath of 9-11 and the Iraq war that I think a lot

57:28.500 --> 57:32.420
of people probably could hear something like that and be like, fuck, I don't know.

57:32.420 --> 57:33.420
Maybe.

57:33.420 --> 57:37.900
I don't know, I mean, the only thing that, like, the main argument I would have against

57:37.900 --> 57:42.980
that is just, like, that seems like biting off more than the government can chew, you

57:42.980 --> 57:43.980
know?

57:43.980 --> 57:47.340
Like, there's not the infrastructure in place to get everybody to wear gray uniforms.

57:47.340 --> 57:50.820
That's going to take a monumental effort of manufacturing.

57:50.820 --> 57:54.860
I think he was talking about the conscripted youths wearing gray uniforms.

57:54.860 --> 57:55.860
All right.

57:55.860 --> 57:59.980
Well, still, you've got to outfit all these kids with submachine guns.

57:59.980 --> 58:00.980
That's going to be noticed.

58:00.980 --> 58:01.980
Yeah.

58:01.980 --> 58:08.020
The gun manufacturers and the gun sellers are all used to exploiting fears about the

58:08.020 --> 58:11.700
people having too many, you know, like, I don't think it's going to happen.

58:11.700 --> 58:12.700
No.

58:12.700 --> 58:18.220
But, I mean, the kernels of some of this stuff is stuff that I remember, like, not sounding

58:18.220 --> 58:19.220
that crazy.

58:19.220 --> 58:23.660
The national draft, you could totally, yeah, the national draft, you totally, I was scared.

58:23.660 --> 58:29.220
I remember not insane people having that conversation about, like, is there a possibility that a

58:29.220 --> 58:33.580
draft may come back because of the world circumstances?

58:33.580 --> 58:34.580
Totally.

58:34.580 --> 58:40.700
And so I think you can take that level of, like, okay, that's not that nuts, and then

58:40.700 --> 58:48.100
attach all this nuts stuff on it and get someone to, I don't know, accept the nuts stuff because

58:48.100 --> 58:49.100
of the...

58:49.100 --> 58:54.140
Yeah, if I can buy something that is ostensibly nuts, which is the reinstatement of the draft,

58:54.140 --> 59:00.180
then it's not that much bigger of a step to assume that there will be gray-clad children

59:00.180 --> 59:02.660
with submachine guns patrolling my neighborhood.

59:02.660 --> 59:03.660
Yeah.

59:03.660 --> 59:04.660
All of this because of seat belts?

59:04.660 --> 59:05.660
Sure.

59:05.660 --> 59:06.660
Okay.

59:06.660 --> 59:11.060
So another thing that Alex talks about a bit is there's a mad cow situation in Canada,

59:11.060 --> 59:17.420
and the Canadian beef market is taking a hit because of, there's at least a few cases of

59:17.420 --> 59:20.100
mad cow have been discovered and there's a fear of an outbreak.

59:20.100 --> 59:21.100
Yes.

59:21.100 --> 59:28.060
And Alex is complaining a bunch about how you need to, you can't be feeding animals

59:28.060 --> 59:31.600
other animals, dead animals, especially sick animals.

59:31.600 --> 59:35.780
You can't be feeding herbivores animal products and stuff like that.

59:35.780 --> 59:38.360
And fine, I agree.

59:38.360 --> 59:40.860
But I don't know what the answer is other than regulation.

59:40.860 --> 59:44.260
Well, we can't do regulation.

59:44.260 --> 59:45.260
It's nuts.

59:45.260 --> 59:50.080
He just complains about how people can't be allowed to do these things.

59:50.080 --> 59:53.700
How do you deal with this from a functional standpoint?

59:53.700 --> 59:56.860
He never brings up a solution other than people shouldn't do it.

59:56.860 --> 59:58.820
It's the free market system.

59:58.820 --> 01:00:04.860
If everybody wakes up, if he's got a 90% wake up rate, then the free market will, I assume,

01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:09.000
account for the fact that people know that these businesses shouldn't be doing that.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.580
So all of these people won't patronize these businesses.

01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:14.020
Well, it'll be too late because they'll have mad cow.

01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:15.580
They will have mad cow by then.

01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:16.640
That is unfortunate.

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:17.640
That is unfortunate.

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:18.640
Yeah.

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:20.980
I think regulation might be the only way to really...

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:21.980
Boy, it could work.

01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:22.980
Yeah.

01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:23.980
Anyway, I thought that was really stupid.

01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:24.980
Very.

01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:28.380
Alex has a call from a guy and he says Jesus a couple times.

01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:31.500
Like just like, oh, Jesus Christ, you know, like...

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:32.500
Oh, as an epithet.

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:33.500
No.

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:34.900
Well, sort of as an exclamation.

01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:36.020
Gotcha.

01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:38.020
Alex ends the call.

01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:39.020
And this is...

01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:40.140
Because he's taken to the Lord's name in vain?

01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:44.100
Well, not because of that, but it's definitely what's on his mind.

01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:45.900
John, great to hear from you.

01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:48.100
I appreciate the call, sir.

01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:49.540
Great points from the United Kingdom.

01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:53.060
Please, though, I'm a Christian and we're on a many Christian stations.

01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:55.100
I know we have a worldly audience.

01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:59.540
Be very careful about using the Lord's name in vain because I don't want repercussions

01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:02.800
of that, not from stations, but from God.

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:07.740
So I'm not mad at you, John, but be careful about, you know, being like the rest of the

01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:08.740
world.

01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:09.740
I'm not trying to chastise you.

01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:10.740
I just...

01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:11.740
Please, folks.

01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:12.740
We have a lot of homeschoolers listening as well.

01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:13.740
No!

01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:14.740
And...

01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:15.740
What?

01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:16.740
And not...

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:18.220
What did you just say?

01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:19.900
And not use the Lord's name in vain.

01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:22.820
I don't want to divert people off, but that's an important point.

01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:24.340
That is an important point.

01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:25.340
Wow.

01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:27.340
Cut to 2021.

01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:31.780
And Jesus says, you gotta buy my products!

01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:33.060
I gotta trick Dick.

01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:34.060
Yep.

01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:35.060
Yep.

01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:36.860
Oh, boy.

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:39.860
What a fucking ridiculous thing to say.

01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:44.580
I worry about God's vengeance when a caller says Jesus Christ on my show.

01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:46.900
Yeah, I think that's performative.

01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:47.900
Maybe.

01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:48.900
Just a ten.

01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:49.900
Yeah, I think that's a little bit.

01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:50.900
Just a hair.

01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:56.580
So Alex thanks the audience here for putting his content out into the world, making copies

01:01:56.580 --> 01:02:01.420
of his videos and stuff, because those things aren't going to spread themselves, and 90%

01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:02.420
success rate.

01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:03.420
90% wake up.

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:04.420
Pretty impressive.

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:06.020
We've got to research that, because whatever he's doing...

01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:10.180
I can only commend you, thank you so much for what you've done.

01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:14.220
In fact, I never thanked the listeners enough, the people that have gotten my films, the

01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:17.420
people that have made copies and are still making copies.

01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:20.140
Those that have aired them on local community TV stations.

01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:23.340
Those that have rented out the movie theaters and shown it.

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:30.740
Those that have rented out the local gym or ample theater and shown it on a big screen

01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:31.740
TV.

01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:34.460
I want to commend everybody.

01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:35.460
God bless you.

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:39.100
It's really having an effect, because we could back the globalist off.

01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:44.300
I have no doubt that if we wouldn't have been fighting them on 9-1-1 and exposing their

01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:47.940
involvement, the globalist would have already carried out more chairs.

01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:48.940
Fuck you.

01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:49.940
Yup.

01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:50.940
Wow.

01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:55.460
I'm a fan of that kind of framing of things, you know?

01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:56.460
That's always really fun.

01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:57.980
Like, if we hadn't been doing this...

01:02:57.980 --> 01:03:03.100
You know, actually, your supporting my show and spreading my materials has actually made

01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:06.180
it so the globalists can't pull off another 9-11.

01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:07.180
Yup.

01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:08.180
Yup.

01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:09.580
It's so great.

01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:16.300
That's why Mark Wahlberg flies on every flight he can, all day every day, because he's trying

01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:21.180
to make sure that no more 9-11s will happen, and the only way to stop it is to put a Mark

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:26.380
Wahlberg on your plane and have an Alex tell you how to stop it, I guess.

01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:27.380
Right.

01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:28.380
There we go.

01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:29.380
We did it.

01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:31.380
I think we've just fixed terrorism.

01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:37.340
Can you imagine what kind of a shithead you'd have to be to act like this?

01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:41.620
We could be like, okay, hey, thanks everyone for supporting our podcast, and actually,

01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:45.300
I'm certain that there would have been another Oklahoma City bombing, there would have been

01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:50.140
another Patriot federal building bombing if you hadn't been supporting our show.

01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:51.740
What the fuck?

01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:58.420
Listen, your support for our show made it so January 6th was not as bad as it could

01:03:58.420 --> 01:03:59.420
have been.

01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:01.940
Could have been worse, but we did it.

01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:02.940
Here's the problem.

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:04.900
That is something that did happen.

01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:09.700
Alex is making up imaginary things that didn't happen because his show is finished.

01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:15.080
So what you're saying is, we successfully stopped the attack on January 7th.

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:16.780
That would be how you'd have to frame it.

01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:17.780
Okay.

01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:18.780
Then we did it.

01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:19.780
Okay.

01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:26.660
So there's some people who are saying that the war is kind of like a holy war.

01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:27.820
Yeah, that's not good.

01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:28.820
No.

01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:29.820
And Alex thinks that's bullshit.

01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:30.820
Good.

01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:31.820
However...

01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:32.820
Oh, no.

01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:38.660
And they said, this is a holy war and you're with the devil if you're against it.

01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:39.660
That was a fraud.

01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:45.140
But when they said that God has taken his protection away from America and allowed these

01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:49.300
attacks to take place because we have become a corrupt and decadent nation on average,

01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:51.380
that was true.

01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:53.140
It's a scientific fact.

01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:54.780
You read what's shown.

01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:55.780
Okay.

01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:56.780
All right.

01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:57.780
Okay.

01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:02.620
It is a scientific fact that God removed his protection over the United States.

01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:03.620
That's why 9-11 happened.

01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:06.220
In order to allow 9-11 to happen.

01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:07.220
Yep.

01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:09.180
And that is why it's not a holy war.

01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:10.180
No.

01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:12.660
Because it's divine retribution.

01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:17.500
Also, Alex does say now that people who are against him are with the devil.

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:18.760
Yes, 100%.

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:20.740
So I guess it's a holy war now.

01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:22.620
Well, now it's a holy war.

01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:23.620
Right.

01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:24.620
But back then it wasn't.

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:28.300
I'd like him to scientifically prove that God's protection was removed and that's what

01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:29.300
made 9-11 happen.

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:36.100
Yeah, what exactly is God's protection doing around the United States prior to that area?

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:39.300
Did we never have any terrorist attacks prior to that?

01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:40.300
None.

01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:41.300
None.

01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:42.300
Okay, good.

01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:45.900
So Alex takes another call from a guy and he brings up scripture in a kind of clunky

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:46.900
way.

01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:47.900
I just found this to be amusing.

01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:50.260
Bill in New Jersey, you're up next.

01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:51.260
Howard, go ahead.

01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:52.260
Yes, sir.

01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:53.260
Mr. Alex Jones.

01:05:53.260 --> 01:06:03.340
I have recently been reading in 2 Chronicles 23-11 and, you know, they anointed a son of

01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:07.780
a king, you know, they said God saved the king, you know.

01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:09.780
23-11 wasn't long.

01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:14.740
So I don't know if you're familiar with 2 Chronicles 23-11.

01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:15.740
Okay.

01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:16.740
Okay.

01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:17.740
All right.

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:18.740
Okay.

01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:20.300
Got a weird vibe going on.

01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:21.300
Yep.

01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:22.300
Don't know what's happening.

01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:23.780
Are you guys talking about kings?

01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:24.780
Well.

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:25.780
Something?

01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:29.380
The Chronicles are about the, I mean, they're literal chronicles of all the cool shit that

01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:30.740
the kings did.

01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:31.740
Sure.

01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:32.740
Sure.

01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:35.580
So, easy caller, easy.

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:36.580
What do you want to talk about?

01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:37.580
Let's hear it.

01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:42.100
But the idea of this, I've got a book here that says the true story of the seventh in

01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:47.140
line to the British crown, and of course in that book is pictures of the mother and the

01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:51.500
queen's mother, and they all kind of look like the Bush family, you know.

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:54.260
And of course I know that the Constitution was...

01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:57.780
You're talking about British Israelism.

01:06:57.780 --> 01:06:59.280
Well that's possible.

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:00.780
No he's not.

01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:03.180
But that's interesting, because that implies...

01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:05.980
That Alex knows very clearly what British Israelism is.

01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:07.380
Well at least he knows of it.

01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:08.380
Yes.

01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:09.380
It doesn't imply that.

01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:12.140
It proves that Alex is aware of it as a concept, he knows it's a thing.

01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:17.860
It's not something that he can feign complete ignorance about, which is a problem.

01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:18.860
Yeah.

01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:24.100
So the true caller, what he's talking about is a book that is about Prince Charles' brother,

01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:28.180
his younger brother, the seventh in line for the...

01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:32.140
It's not Andrew, it's the other, I think Edward is the other brother.

01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:33.140
Sure.

01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:34.140
Nah, whatever.

01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:35.140
I don't like royals.

01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:38.180
Yeah, it's just some biography about him.

01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:39.180
Sure.

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:42.260
I don't think it has anything to do with British Israelism.

01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:46.860
It sounds like where he's going is that the Bushes are related to the British royal family.

01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:50.100
Well, I don't know where he's going exactly.

01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:51.660
Well, that's fair.

01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:53.140
And I've listened to this.

01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:54.140
That's fair.

01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:55.140
That is fair.

01:07:55.140 --> 01:08:00.100
So the caller brought up the scripture, and he's talking about anointing of kings is in

01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:01.100
the Bible.

01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:02.100
Right.

01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:07.420
And he's saying he read this book about the royals, and they look like Bushes or whatever.

01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:08.420
Right.

01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:09.420
Right.

01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:13.700
And so I miked down for this, because I want you to help me out here.

01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:14.700
Okay.

01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:20.420
And I can't tell if what this caller is bringing up is a satirical suggestion, or if it's sincere.

01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:21.420
Okay.

01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:22.420
I'm not sure.

01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:23.420
All right.

01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:29.100
You know, in the Bible, it talks about how they anointed the king and gave him the testimonies.

01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:33.900
And they were the Constitution, you know how they're tearing up the Constitution and manipulating

01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:34.900
it.

01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:38.820
Maybe we should forsake the Constitution and go with the king in this country.

01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:43.780
And we should say, God save George W. Bush, you know, King George, you know.

01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:50.340
So will we say that if Hitler was in Germany, let's go ahead, the Bible says follow Hitler?

01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:52.820
A lot of people like Hitler, you know.

01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:53.820
In Germany, they did.

01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:54.820
I don't know why.

01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:55.820
He was a complete badass.

01:08:55.820 --> 01:09:01.380
I tell you what, I think that's another story about, I think Deuteronomy 23, 2, about, you

01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:06.540
know, how illegitimate children were allowed into the congregation of God for ten generations.

01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:10.300
It was a Jewish law, you know, Deuteronomy 23, 2.

01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:11.460
But that's the Old Testament.

01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:12.460
We have the New Testament.

01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:13.460
That's right.

01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:15.540
And I don't know what's going on here.

01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:20.420
I can't tell, like, I think this is a sincere suggestion that the caller is making.

01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:21.420
I agree.

01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:27.140
But I can also see a way that he's really poorly expressing sort of a point of satire,

01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:30.980
like, hey, you know, it's in the Bible that we have kings, why shouldn't we have King

01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:32.460
George?

01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:37.500
Like being, like presenting that as like an over-the-top argument.

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:39.860
But then again, I don't know what the point of that would be.

01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:42.020
Like what would be underneath that satire?

01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:43.500
Is he satirizing the Bible?

01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:44.500
Uh, no.

01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:45.500
I don't know.

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:50.300
No, I view this as him being 100% sincere.

01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:52.000
It kind of feels that way.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:59.680
And I think the main reason for that is he's been reading about how great kings have been

01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:03.980
and how a philosopher king is perhaps the best type of government that there possibly

01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:10.060
could be and has decided that democracy has failed us, the Constitution is meaningless,

01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:11.700
and we should have a king.

01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:12.700
Also...

01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:17.820
And Alex, after a little while, is going to agree with him.

01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:18.820
True.

01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:19.820
Yeah.

01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:24.020
Yes, I do think that Alex has come around on the idea of monarchy, at least a specific

01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:25.020
sort of monarchy.

01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:26.020
Seems like it.

01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:30.020
Um, yeah, weird, weird that this guy's rebuttal to Alex being like, should we all just...

01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:31.020
A lot of people liked Hitler.

01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:33.020
A lot of people liked Hitler.

01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:34.020
Ooh.

01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:35.900
A lot of people didn't.

01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:38.300
A lot of people didn't.

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:41.200
I would say probably a significantly larger number.

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:45.680
So this is something that kind of is a problem for Alex.

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:50.480
Much like the Republic of Texas callers, this is something that sticks in Alex's craw.

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.860
And so he goes to another call, and he's got to bring it up.

01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:56.140
He's got to bring up this idea of making Bush king.

01:10:56.140 --> 01:11:00.420
Hey, what do you think of these people that say it's Christian to worship your leader

01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:01.980
and not criticize your leader?

01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:04.020
Yeah, yeah, that's another important thing.

01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:07.420
You know, don't put down a king just because he's king.

01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:08.420
What?

01:11:08.420 --> 01:11:11.180
He's a good king, he's a bad king.

01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:15.180
And my family, I have two lines of royal blood dating back, I don't know how long.

01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:16.180
I'm sorry, what now?

01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:20.780
The one, I'm not going to say the name, but he was elected by the people.

01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:23.460
The people held him up, and they said, we want him king.

01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:28.020
Sir, sir, sir, this whole thing of getting rid of the Constitution and making Bush king.

01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:32.040
George Washington fought in the backyard of the house I grew up in.

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:33.940
This didn't go the way Alex wanted it to.

01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:36.640
Yeah, this is spiraled out of control pretty quickly.

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:38.900
This is spiraled out of control real quick.

01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:42.900
Hey buddy, I kind of got the sense that maybe you'd back me up on this whole making kings

01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:43.900
thing is bad.

01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:47.220
Hey, some kings are good, actually I have two royal blood lines.

01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:51.460
Yeah, yeah, that's definitely not what you would be expecting.

01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:58.260
I mean, if you're Alex, with your Alex audience, I can't imagine you would get two pro-monarchy

01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:00.860
people in a row.

01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:02.420
That would be a surprise to me as well.

01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:06.500
Yeah, I mean, at a certain point it's just like, wow, this is bad luck, it's full moon

01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:08.260
or something, I don't know.

01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:14.180
I mean, his fucking description of kings is literally, don't hate the player, hate the

01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:15.180
game.

01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:16.180
Some kings are good.

01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:17.180
Some kings are good.

01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:21.420
Some kings are good, like the two blood lines I come from.

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:22.420
I won't say which.

01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:24.100
No, no, no, no.

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:26.740
But George Washington fought in my backyard, just throwing that out there.

01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:31.660
I wouldn't want to dox my blood.

01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:34.860
I'd hate it if the Tudors heard I was bad mouthing them behind their backs.

01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:37.340
Alex has said that he's related to the Tudors.

01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:38.340
Yes.

01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:39.340
Maybe they're related.

01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:40.340
Could be.

01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:41.340
Could be.

01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:46.180
So we're coming into the end of this here, and on the 27th Alex gets into talking a little

01:12:46.180 --> 01:12:55.700
bit about some new news stories about some SSRI issues that are becoming conversations.

01:12:55.700 --> 01:13:03.820
One of them is about dangers of withdrawal for some SSRI medications, and that is a real

01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:07.660
thing, although Alex is trying to portray it as just being on these drugs will make

01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:10.900
you kill people and what have you.

01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:17.540
I thought this was bizarre, because Alex hasn't updated any of these talking points for 18

01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:18.540
years.

01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:22.260
These are all the same things that he says just word for word.

01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:28.580
By the way, when they did these studies in the early 80s of Prozac, they found a large

01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:33.100
percentage, around 14%, had suicidal tendencies.

01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:35.940
You see, it puts you into a dream state.

01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:42.820
So you're happily bumbling around kind of in a mesmerized, mind-controlled state, literally.

01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:46.580
Then you have a bad day or a bad trip.

01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:53.740
These drugs are more associated with hallucinogens than they are with other type drug families.

01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:55.260
And some people just have a snap.

01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:58.860
I've talked to psychologists and people that know what's happening, and they say that they've

01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:03.060
had patients who were on it, and they're dancing around naked with butcher knives on top of

01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:05.460
their houses, they kill their kids.

01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:10.100
Most of these women who killed their kids were on multiple drugs, almost all the shooters.

01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:13.260
In fact, we haven't found one yet who wasn't on these drugs.

01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:15.020
Yes, we have.

01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:19.220
It also makes you very open to suggestion.

01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:22.340
It puts you into a subconscious state, folks.

01:14:22.340 --> 01:14:25.460
These people are sleepwalking.

01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:29.620
This is just exactly the same sort of stuff that he says all the time.

01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:33.460
And the thing that I think is really interesting is that story about the butcher knife on top

01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:38.700
of a roof is also the specific example that he uses for years and years.

01:14:38.700 --> 01:14:46.260
This one image that he has of a case of somebody with a butcher knife on a roof, I think this

01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:47.780
is just deeply irresponsible.

01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:55.860
I think this is the definition of an unnuanced take on psychiatric meds.

01:14:55.860 --> 01:15:06.820
Yeah, I mean, there's not much to say whenever it's like, man, in 2003, I was unmedicated

01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:09.300
just coming into my own as a type one bipolar person.

01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:11.580
But you could see reality, man.

01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:20.020
And just reading about it back then, it was legitimately in the literature of bipolar

01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:26.120
type one was just straight up like one fifth of you don't make it for whatever reason.

01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:28.640
And it's related to your mental illness.

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:32.260
And like that idea of somebody being like, well, you know what?

01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:39.380
That's better than SSRIs and feeling good is just like, I just don't know how you can

01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:45.300
talk to somebody who's aware of the death toll that just being alive gives them.

01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:46.300
Yeah.

01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:47.300
Yeah.

01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:48.300
It's real shitty.

01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:54.540
In a way you could say that giving someone life is in fact giving someone death.

01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:59.980
Yeah, there's a lot of factors and variables that Alex isn't taking into account here.

01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:05.860
And obviously any medication that people take isn't without risk.

01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:11.040
Living without medications for some people is also a great risk.

01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:17.500
And it's unfair to attack medication because of the risk while not accepting that there

01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:21.780
is a great risk to not taking medication.

01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:26.460
And the fucked up part of it, the fucked up part of it is what one of the biggest contributors

01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:27.500
to that is.

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:32.280
Let's say you were on an SSRI and then you listen to a fucking radio show and suddenly

01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:34.900
decided to stop taking your medication.

01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:40.200
And then your withdrawals fucking light you up and you become part of the statistics that

01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:45.460
Alex is going to use the next year to say that people who are on SSRI should immediately

01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:48.740
stop them as part of his evidence for what's just so fucking-

01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:55.780
I have to correct you because it is that Alex does bring up that just stopping taking meds

01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:56.780
is dangerous.

01:16:56.780 --> 01:16:57.780
Well that's good.

01:16:57.780 --> 01:16:58.780
Yeah.

01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:04.500
I don't know if it's enough to dissuade his listeners who hear him say that taking meds

01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:10.340
make you have a bad trip or you're just brainwashed and sleepwalking through life.

01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:17.260
But he does actually say that you need to take a decreasing dose and it's dangerous

01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:18.420
just to stop.

01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:19.420
That's very good.

01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:20.420
Yeah.

01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:21.420
I mean credit where credit's due.

01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:22.420
Oh totally.

01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:26.140
At the very least he's doing the absolute bare minimum while fear mongering about the

01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:27.140
meds.

01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:31.420
I just couldn't let that not be said because he does actually-

01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:34.420
It's good to say, it's good to point out, yes.

01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:38.300
Now unfortunately he also says things like this.

01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:42.220
And that says, last year more than 22 million prescriptions for antidepressants were written

01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:44.140
out by British patients.

01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:45.140
Most of them for SSRIs.

01:17:45.140 --> 01:17:50.820
These drugs work by allowing the hormone serotonin to act properly in the brain controlling mood

01:17:50.820 --> 01:17:51.820
swings.

01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:53.540
Oh to act properly.

01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:54.540
How about you go for a jog?

01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:56.860
How about you splash some cold water on your face?

01:17:56.860 --> 01:18:00.220
How about you get on your knees and ask God to heal you?

01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:06.860
Because believe me folks, their vaccines, their drugs are a bunch of trash.

01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:07.860
Yeah.

01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:10.140
And apparently you should just pray.

01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:15.220
Well, you know, I feel like I'm worthless and like I'm a drain on every single human

01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:20.340
being around me and that every part of life would be improved if I were no longer here

01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:21.340
for it.

01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:23.100
But actually you know what I should have just done?

01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:24.100
Jog.

01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:25.100
Gone for a run.

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:26.100
Yeah.

01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:27.100
My bad, my bad.

01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:28.100
Just jog.

01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:32.060
While I was running I definitely wouldn't fixate on those very same repetitive thoughts

01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:33.180
that I can't get out of my way.

01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:36.020
No, you should just pray that God heals you.

01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:37.660
She's gotta pray.

01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:40.940
Man, that advice really worked for me when I was growing up.

01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:41.940
Oh me too.

01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:42.940
I got that one a lot.

01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:43.940
Yeah.

01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:44.940
Fixed everything.

01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:45.940
Yeah, it solved a lot of problems.

01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:52.420
I mean, look, I don't want to like give any credence to what Alex is saying, but you know,

01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:55.140
exercise can help people feel better.

01:18:55.140 --> 01:18:57.820
Exercise and meditation are great ways to cope.

01:18:57.820 --> 01:18:59.180
They absolutely are.

01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:00.180
Yeah.

01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:06.140
But that is not a full health regimen necessarily.

01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:13.580
And I think that this is just kind of dangerous, kind of bad, and I think, you know, obviously

01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:17.700
it's not what I'm looking for in terms of figuring out if Alex believes he's fighting

01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:19.340
the literal devil.

01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:23.920
There's a corollary here that Alex does seem to think that health can be achieved by God

01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:25.100
giving it to you.

01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:26.100
Yes.

01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:27.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:32.740
So there is at least some kind of weird religiosity here.

01:19:32.740 --> 01:19:41.780
Yeah, I mean, there's definitely an escalation from metaphorical to Jesus and God having

01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:50.140
a literal effect on curing you, which suggests that they are real, literally, and if they

01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:54.460
are real literally, then his cosmology suggests that the devil is real literally.

01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:59.980
I'm not positive that that is an assumption that you can make, because I think that a

01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:07.900
lot of people can believe in literalness of God's existence without believing literally

01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:10.500
in an antagonist Satan.

01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:12.100
Sure, sure.

01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:14.100
That's, I agree with you, that's true.

01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:19.740
I think the evidence presented so far in 2003 of Alex, though, is such that you can't be

01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:26.780
like, I'm guessing his belief in the Bible does not include Satan.

01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:31.700
But I also think that you can believe in the literalness of God and not necessarily believe

01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:35.860
in the literalness of prayer is a health care plan.

01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:36.860
True.

01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:43.980
You know, like, I think that there is a difference between those kinds of engagement with religion.

01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:44.980
Yeah, absolutely.

01:20:44.980 --> 01:20:52.140
And I think you're seeing that Alex is at least clearly in the God is better than single

01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:53.140
payer.

01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:54.140
Yes.

01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:55.140
Yes.

01:20:55.140 --> 01:20:56.900
In 2003, but I still haven't found...

01:20:56.900 --> 01:20:57.900
Single payer?

01:20:57.900 --> 01:20:58.900
More like single prayer.

01:20:58.900 --> 01:20:59.900
Boom.

01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:00.900
That's what we do.

01:21:00.900 --> 01:21:06.220
I still haven't found enough evidence of literal Satan, so we will keep looking.

01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:08.380
Although this episode was just bizarre.

01:21:08.380 --> 01:21:14.740
I mean, beyond just the boringness of it, it's very boring.

01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:16.340
Just standard ass Bilderberg shit.

01:21:16.340 --> 01:21:17.340
Yeah.

01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:22.220
But behind that, you have two guys who are, have a lot of appearances of anti-Semitism,

01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:26.500
who are the experts that Alex has on to talk about the Bilderberg stuff, which I think

01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:29.860
is a problem, and it definitely merits attention.

01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:30.860
Yeah.

01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:38.860
Next, the other thing that I'm seeing here, bizarrely, 22nd to 27th of May, 2003, Alex

01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:40.700
isn't talking about Putin.

01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:41.700
No.

01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:43.420
It was conspicuous in its absence.

01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:47.580
I don't think it means anything, but it's like he would talk about the fucking apartments

01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:51.180
and Putin constantly, and on these episodes, it doesn't come up.

01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:53.980
It might just be that he had other things to talk about, but.

01:21:53.980 --> 01:21:59.720
I mean, I would get distracted too if my guests were notorious anti-Semites and my callers

01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:01.980
were oddly pro-monarchy.

01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:04.260
I would get tossed out of my regular.

01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:08.460
And one guy found an 800 seat Nazi church in the middle of nowhere.

01:22:08.460 --> 01:22:11.100
That would toss me from my regular Putin stuff.

01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:12.100
Yeah.

01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:13.900
Got other fish to fry.

01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:17.140
Or at the very least, I'm distracted by those jangling keys.

01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:18.140
Sure.

01:22:18.140 --> 01:22:19.140
Yeah.

01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:24.540
We have a website on Friday, but until then, we have a website and we have a show on Thursday.

01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:25.540
Yes we do.

01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:30.140
Thursday, July 1st, it's at 9 p.m. at the Lincoln Lodge, there are still some tickets

01:22:30.140 --> 01:22:31.140
available.

01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:32.900
I will have buttons there.

01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:33.900
Ooh.

01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:36.460
Probably not the new buttons, but I have some holdover buttons.

01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:37.460
Nice.

01:22:37.460 --> 01:22:39.420
And if anybody wants to come out, I'll throw a button at you.

01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:40.420
We'll get buttons.

01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:41.420
Yeah.

01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:43.660
You will get, I guarantee, buttons will be tossed at you.

01:22:43.660 --> 01:22:45.220
There will be some buttons there.

01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:47.460
Yeah, it'll be a good time.

01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:52.180
So if you're in Chicago, obviously it's not going to be a live show of our show.

01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:53.180
Right.

01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:59.200
But it is something that, I think that we will have a feeling of, is there an interest

01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:05.060
for a show based on, like if no one comes to this, then I think we'll continue recording

01:23:05.060 --> 01:23:06.060
in my apartment.

01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:07.980
It does seem like that might be the way to go.

01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:11.740
I don't want that to be a threat, but.

01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:14.180
No that was a very good, that was a very good plug.

01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:15.180
Well done.

01:23:15.180 --> 01:23:16.340
Thanks, we're also on Twitter.

01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:18.820
We are on Twitter, it's that knowledge, go to bed Jordan.

01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:19.820
We're on Facebook.

01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:20.820
We are on Facebook.

01:23:20.820 --> 01:23:27.420
If you would like to download a show, go to, apologies, iTunes, iTunes, I lost my mind

01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:31.860
there for a second, iTunes and then find a local charity or bail fund in your area.

01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:37.220
We'll be back, but until then, I'm Neo, I'm Leo, I'm DZX Clark, I'm Daryl Rundis, I actually

01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:44.740
found Barack Obama's secret Baha'i church in Evanston.

01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:47.820
It's actually just the Baha'i temple in Evanston.

01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:48.820
It's not secret.

01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:50.780
I don't think Obama ever went there.

01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:53.580
I just found this really cool building.

01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:55.940
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding.

01:23:55.940 --> 01:24:00.660
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan, I love your work.

01:24:00.660 --> 01:24:15.340
I love you.
