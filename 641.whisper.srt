1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,960
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying, we are the bad guys, knowledge

2
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:30,960
fight, knowledge fight, I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys, saying, we are

3
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:42,200
the bad guys, knowledge fight, knowledge fight, need money, Andy and Kansas, Andy and Kansas,

4
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:48,240
stop it, Andy and Kansas, Andy and Kansas, it's time to pray, Andy and Kansas, you're

5
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,040
on the air, thanks for holding us, hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan, I

6
00:00:52,040 --> 00:01:00,400
love your work, knowledge fight, knowledge fight, I love you, hey everybody, welcome

7
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,720
back to knowledge fight, I'm Dan, I'm Jordan, we're couple dudes, like to sit around, worship

8
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,920
at the altar of Selene and talk a little bit about Alex, Emmerich Jones and the ongoing

9
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:16,360
adventures of drain swirling, I don't know, that's what came to mind, that wasn't great,

10
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,400
I can do better, yeah, we'll get there, it's 2022, we'll get something for it later, we'll

11
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,200
figure it out, yeah, yeah, Dan, Dan, Jordan, Dan, what's up, Dan, what's your bright spot

12
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,240
today, my bright spot today is actually a bright spot of anger, it's a bright spot of

13
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,960
anger, yes, and the anger is that no one told me about a thing existing before and I stumbled

14
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,920
across it and now it's all I want to do, I've found that on YouTube there are a bunch of

15
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:49,840
channels that are just like, they set up a camera and animals show up, you didn't know

16
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,240
that, no, it's taken the internet by storm since fat bear week like 10 years ago, I knew

17
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,560
about fat bear week but I thought that was a special event, no man, I didn't realise

18
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,280
that there were these cameras that you could just watch like live all the time, 24 7, I

19
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,600
found one that was in the Namibian desert and it's a watering hole, right, and so for

20
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,640
about 5 minutes I'm watching this ibix or ibix or however you pronounce that, drink

21
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:25,680
from this watering hole, like this is fascinating, then a second ibix showed up and I cheered,

22
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,560
sitting alone in the apartment I cheered for the appearance of another animal, I'm telling

23
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:37,040
you right now, you can get so many cameras that are just 24 7 on a nest with eggs in

24
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,640
there and it is your entire life, I don't want that, that's too much like tension, entire

25
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:49,280
life just sitting there, I don't want to be waiting for the egg to hatch, that's too high

26
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,880
stakes but watching just a watering hole, that's great, I'm going to be lost to the

27
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:01,620
world now, this is where I'm heading, I like that you are in some sense digitally retreating

28
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,960
to the wilderness, you know, like you can't go and move into the middle of the woods but

29
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,900
you can through the vision of a camera, the desire has been there, maybe this is the only

30
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,240
way that I can manifest it, also one of the ibixes walked past the camera, I'm like, look

31
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:20,960
at that guy, look at him, look at you, so what about you, what's your bright spot, my

32
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,480
bright spot dad is, no, no, no, my partner is a teacher and that means that right around

33
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:36,000
this time of year all of the girl scouts circle like vultures on weak teachers, sure, ready

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,280
to pounce, you got to do your part, right, right, so despite the fact that I'm sure it's

35
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,800
in some way some sort of evil cartel, the girl scouts, it has to be, I would assume

36
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:51,600
so, I haven't read anything about it but you're sure it is, so now we have a shit ton of boxes,

37
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:57,480
awesome, are orders still open, I'm pretty sure, I might need you to put in an order

38
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:04,000
for me, I've got some, okay, listen, buy these second hand, at this point if the cops came

39
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,840
I would be busted for intent to distribute, that's how many fucking boxes we have here,

40
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,240
I'm looking for some samoas, I've got some, I'm looking for some tagalongs, you can't

41
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,080
have any of my fucking tagalongs, dammit, you don't get a single cookie, I don't want

42
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,700
thin mints, that's, I've had my fill of those, yeah, yeah, yeah, I got some s'mores ones

43
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,500
for you, what, you have s'mores ones now, oh yeah, when did they start this, you don't

44
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:30,520
want to know, okay, anyways that's my bright spot, that is a pretty bright spot, look I

45
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:36,160
like sweets, yeah, we've got some negotiations after the show, I will say that I like sweets

46
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,360
when times are tough, when things are good I have much less of a sweet tooth, right,

47
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,860
right, right, hey looks like times have been tough, huh, so Jordan today we have an episode

48
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:52,360
to go over that has been long in the works and we've teased this a little bit but not

49
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:58,280
very specifically, things like I've mentioned that I have some side things, indeed, I'm

50
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:06,080
working on, yes, and things like when, beginning of December we had two past episodes, we had

51
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:12,020
a little break, we had a little break and nobody knew why, yes, and that all will become

52
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:18,040
clear on today's episode, but before we get down to business on that, let's take a little

53
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:23,680
moment to say thank you and hello to some new wonks, so first the Revs Lang, thank you

54
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,800
so much, you're now a policy wonk, I'm a policy wonk, thank you very much, I think that's

55
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:34,440
the Reverends Lang, the Reverends Lang, maybe, the Revs Lang, who knows, next Mother Gerald,

56
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,820
thank you so much, you're now a policy wonk, I'm a policy wonk, thank you very much, next

57
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,880
we have a technocrat in the mix, Jordan, thank you so much, you are now a policy wonk, I'm

58
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,560
a policy wonk, ha ha, I thought you could trip me up, ha ha, dammit, but we also do

59
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,800
have a couple technocrats in the mix, okay, god dammit, so first Jared and Alex's secret

60
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,280
assistant Taylor and then in parentheses, inside joke, thank you so much, you're now

61
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,720
a technocrat, and sorry Adam, Gigi made me give more money to Dan and Jordan because

62
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,320
Bear won't stop howling about globalists, thank you so much, you are now a technocrat,

63
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:12,880
I'm a policy wonk, I have risen above my enemies, I might quit tomorrow actually, I'm just gonna

64
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:22,160
take a little breaky now, a little breaky for me, and then we're going to come back

65
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,400
and I'm gonna start the show over, but I'm the devil, I gotta be taking off the hair,

66
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm getting all this, blah, blah, blah, fuck you, fuck you, I got plenty of words for you,

67
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,520
but at the end of the day, fuck you and your new world order, and fuck the horse you rode

68
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,880
in on, and all your shit, maybe today should be my last broadcast, maybe I'll just be gone

69
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,080
a month, maybe five years, maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow, and you never see me

70
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:53,360
again, that's really what I want to do, I never want to come back here again, I apologize

71
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,680
to the crew and the listeners yesterday that I was legitimately having breakdowns on air,

72
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,480
I'll be better tomorrow, he may be, so thank you all, thank you very, very much, so Jordan,

73
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,560
we have some breaking news in the world of Alex, indeed, as we're recording this here

74
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,840
on Tuesday, for instance we have learned that Alex did go for the January 6th committee,

75
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:24,240
and these are pressing issues that we will talk about on Friday, we have for you today

76
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:31,520
an episode where we will be discussing some depositions from Alex's Sandy Hook case, and

77
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,160
I felt like if we're going to be talking about this, we should probably check in and discuss

78
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:43,400
how all this came about, what the circumstances are, and high witness on the scene, the plaintiff's

79
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:52,800
attorney, so let's throw it to a conversation we pre-recorded with Mark Manxton, well joining

80
00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:01,600
us here in the virtual podcast studio, over Zoom, do we have a name for our lair, I don't

81
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,200
think we do, we should, we should come up with one, should we, like the honeycomb hideout,

82
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:11,000
I think that's a great name for it, so the Bishop Dawn Magic Wand, we're off track, yeah,

83
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,800
already, it's quick, joining us here in the honeycomb hideout, which I'm insisting is

84
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:24,840
the name, is the lead counsel for the plaintiffs in the Sandy Hook lawsuits against Alex Jones,

85
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,800
Mark Manxton, yes hello everybody, welcome back, hello, I'm not using the name by the

86
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,720
way, I'm not saying honeycomb hideout, that's fine, well you're not here, so frankly there's

87
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:44,880
a no boys allowed policy, so, I can respect the rules, so welcome, we wanted to do a little

88
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,320
preface to this episode, because it's a, I think a monumentous occasion, I think it's

89
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,440
auspicious is how I would describe it, sure, yeah, yeah, some would, some would say a narrative

90
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:03,520
twist in things, and so why don't you take it away and present, give us, give us the

91
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:08,880
lowdown of what's up here, well sure, regular view, regular listeners know that I've been

92
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,200
following the podcast for a little while now, and they've been doing some analysis of our

93
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,680
lawsuits and such, and so I actually came onto the podcast, and talked to these wacky

94
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,360
gentlemen, and I had become sort of, I guess you could say, over the course of the lawsuit,

95
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:27,520
sort of peripherally aware of the work y'all are doing, people snitch, sometimes, yeah

96
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:35,480
they do, you know mainstream media is even, I've seen profiles in fairly prestigious publications

97
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,280
describing the unparalleled knowledge, you're talking about, you're talking about the Grey

98
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:46,020
Lady, yeah the Grey Lady, and you know, you can't really, you know, you got to take that

99
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,300
with a grain of salt, because they're the same, same newspaper, it took us to Iraq based

100
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:55,600
on the wings of a lie, but I went ahead and checked it out, and it turns out, wow god

101
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,080
darn this guy really does know a lot about Alex Jones, and I was in the position of,

102
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,760
look I had to make myself an expert on Jones, me and my partner Bill actually had to do

103
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,880
that, and so we watched, oh gosh, I want to say nearly like 100 hours right off the bat

104
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:17,240
within the span of a couple weeks, and it probably flew by, yeah, time flies when your

105
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:23,640
brain is melting, I'll tell you that, and I knew, you're right, like I knew it had a

106
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:30,400
not trivial effect on my brain and perception of the world, so I could, I was so excited

107
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:36,280
to meet you who's been living in this, and it turned out Dan knew a hell of a lot about

108
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,080
Alex Jones.

109
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,160
As some of y'all know, we recently had a default judgment in our cases, but we're entering

110
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,320
sort of the final phase of discovery, which is about the plaintiff's damages, the ways

111
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,960
they were harmed by some of this conduct, and that's required to take us, we had to

112
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:55,600
take corporate deposition, deposition of Alex Jones, and in doing so, I knew that I could

113
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,680
use Dan's knowledge in this process, so that's why I reached out to Dan and asked, hey Dan,

114
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,440
would you consult on this case for me, and Dan said, you know what, I'd be happy to do

115
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,560
that, and I'd be happy to do it free of charge, completely pro bono to the families.

116
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,920
In my defense, I said no.

117
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,440
And also, the way you're saying this is you asked and I said yes, and I don't think that's

118
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:28,320
exactly accurate, I struggled with the decision because of the potential ethical implications

119
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,440
of doing this podcast and inserting myself in some way.

120
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,740
Exactly, which is why I would never want to put somebody in your position who's a commentator

121
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,800
and a person who has collected knowledge on Jones in this way in the position of testifying

122
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,920
at trial, or being a witness the jury would ever hear from, or having any stake in the

123
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,920
outcome.

124
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,920
I'll do it.

125
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,920
Come on.

126
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,440
You could testify from here just screaming.

127
00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:00,400
I knew I'd never do anything like that, and I think certainly experts who consult on cases

128
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:05,040
like this and provide consultation, some of them do charge for their services, and that

129
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,680
would have been totally above board to do, but I really, it's been a lot of people, I

130
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:17,080
mean I'm not going to, it was definitely really appreciated and I love the gesture of you

131
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,600
saying that you'll do this for pro bono, but I don't want to put you on a pedestal because

132
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,600
so many people have.

133
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,380
I have had the kind of support on this case that's unrivaled in my career where people

134
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:32,200
will step out of the woodwork and say, I'm happy to do whatever I can to assist you here.

135
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:37,160
And so yeah, Dan's come aboard and has been helping me quite a bit in terms of doing this

136
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,160
case.

137
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,960
And one of the big surprise for the listeners out there is that Dan personally accompanied

138
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:49,320
me as my consultant to the depositions of the Free Speech Corporate Representative and

139
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,640
of Mr. Alex Jones.

140
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,640
Yes.

141
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:57,520
So your humble narrator for all these years was sitting in the room, not more than four

142
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:03,600
feet across the table from Mr. Jones himself and from his corporate representative, Ms.

143
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,600
Carroba.

144
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:10,380
And I want to be clear, just in case anybody has any kind of misgivings, I did not interact

145
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,120
with them in any way.

146
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,120
Really?

147
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,760
Yeah, he didn't say a word in the entire room.

148
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:22,140
I was a silent person in the room and I had no contact with them outside of the room.

149
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:25,280
So it's not like I shook Alex's hand or like...

150
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:30,740
Part of the reason I said no initially, because I was slightly worried for your physical safety

151
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,840
to be in the same room with Alex Jones.

152
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,720
No, he's a teddy bear.

153
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,760
I mean, in O'Neill life he's a teddy bear.

154
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,360
Yeah, he's just a teddy bear.

155
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,040
A very violent teddy bear.

156
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,400
Stops people's guts in like a good old teddy bear.

157
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
Well, we'll get to that later.

158
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,400
Indeed we will.

159
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,280
It's during that deposition when we take breaks and we're, you know, already Dan had assisted

160
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,360
me in kind of helping me formulate a lot of the questions that I was going to be asking

161
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,360
in that deposition.

162
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,500
But as we're getting answers, Dan's the kind of person who can put his finger on the spot

163
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,300
of a fact and say, no, I know that that isn't true.

164
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,360
You need to ask about X or Y.

165
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,880
So your service is really, I mean, I really want to emphasize just invaluable.

166
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,880
There aren't...

167
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:15,200
Alex Jones, for as much of a phenomenon as he is and for as culturally influential as

168
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:22,520
he has become, he remains relatively understudied both in academic and in pop culture settings.

169
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:27,400
Like it's actually strange how much of his mythos is very shallow.

170
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,920
Like people don't really dig down into what InfoWars is and how it operates and what it

171
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,920
does.

172
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,440
And so that was, that was really, really valuable for me.

173
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,160
So first of all, thank you for that.

174
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,160
That's overwhelming.

175
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:44,320
And thank you for the kind words, Jordan, yell something.

176
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,420
You know, Dan, I'm surprised that when you came back, you didn't report to me how invaluable

177
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,560
your work was.

178
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,520
You kind of downplayed it, which is not like you at all.

179
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:58,440
Usually you come back boastful, like if it weren't for me, this whole thing would have

180
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,520
fallen apart.

181
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,520
That's you, right?

182
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,760
I got the flashiness out of my system before I went because I brought a new suit.

183
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,760
Yes.

184
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,760
That's true.

185
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:12,960
That was kind of my way of like, all right, this is, this is a little walk around with

186
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,560
some swagger.

187
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,800
When we got you a suit, it was an adventure for the both of us.

188
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,800
Right.

189
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,360
Let me tell you, listeners, this gentleman cleans up well.

190
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,360
Not great.

191
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,880
And I get dirty real fast, but I clean up okay.

192
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,800
You know, one of the things we had talked about before you had decided to help me and

193
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,680
consult with me on this is that if you were going to be offering me advice on this and

194
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,100
seeing some of the proceedings, you know, part of your insistence was, look, I'm a commentator

195
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,100
on Jones.

196
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,540
I critically analyze what he's doing.

197
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,440
I need to be able to continue to do that about this lawsuit.

198
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,560
And if you were an expert witness who's going to be testifying to a jury, you probably shouldn't

199
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,560
be doing that.

200
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,560
Right.

201
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,400
Because eventually your testimony is going to have to be considered.

202
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,040
But if you're just an outside consultant, and when it comes to things that are in the

203
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,320
public record now, I couldn't stop you if I wanted to like legally, you have a First

204
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,240
Amendment right that trumps anything that's going on.

205
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,920
And so it loves the First Amendment.

206
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,920
I know he loves it.

207
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,920
So yeah.

208
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,920
Yeah.

209
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,920
Take that, Mark.

210
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,120
You can't stop us even if you fucking want it to.

211
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,440
Well, I can get creative, right?

212
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,440
You know?

213
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,440
Okay.

214
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,440
We'll never know it.

215
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,360
But but no, it's it's it.

216
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,840
I knew coming into this that you were still gonna be talking about Alex Jones.

217
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,100
And I knew, for instance, that these these depositions, if they did become public record

218
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,600
would be part of that.

219
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:42,640
And what happened so that your listeners understand is that there's a protective order of confidentiality

220
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:47,520
in the case, and it provides a process by which if a party gives testimony or documents

221
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:52,040
that it believes it wants to maintain confidentiality, not have them be public, it provides them

222
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,220
an avenue for them to do that.

223
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,520
And in this particular situation, much as they have in the past info wars chose not

224
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,700
to do that.

225
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:04,560
So very recently, the deposition of Alex Jones and the deposition of Miss Karpova, the corporate

226
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:09,200
representative passed into the public domain when they became unchallenged public filings

227
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,540
in these cases.

228
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,780
And so there's been some news reporting on them and some of the documents contained within

229
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,140
those depositions already.

230
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,740
And so all that's now out in the public record.

231
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:23,620
So now, listeners, you get to hear a little bit about it, and Dan's gonna be able to talk

232
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,620
to you about it.

233
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,620
Yeah.

234
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:34,240
And I want to stress too that like, it's, it, I can't, like, one of the downsides of

235
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,620
me do, like being in the position of like, doing this episode and being there, sure,

236
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:42,360
is that, you know, obviously, I experienced things.

237
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,920
And some of those things I can't talk about, because they aren't part of what is in the

238
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,920
public record.

239
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,920
Right, right, right.

240
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:53,660
And so there will, you know, there will be a lot of things that are not really material

241
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:57,700
to the analysis of the depositions themselves.

242
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:01,860
But I, you know, I have, you know, some thoughts that I just can't share.

243
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:09,060
Yeah, I mean, if you wanted to, you, you couldn't even talk about the mutated second human being

244
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,940
coming out of his chest.

245
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,100
Kawado, I believe was his name.

246
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,420
I told you that in confidence.

247
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,340
No, no, I'm saying you can't talk about Kawado.

248
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,340
Okay.

249
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,340
That's my

250
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,340
good reference.

251
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:25,380
The deep, deep pull there, Jordan.

252
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:31,100
Oh, my gosh, yeah, no, and in fact, I think that's one of the reasons I want to come on

253
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:35,260
this kind of not not for you, because you know, though, but but so that the audience

254
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:39,340
understands how you're talking about these, there are some ground rules that that Dan

255
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,980
has to observe when talking about these things.

256
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:46,900
And one of that is that because his consulting position gives them access to things that

257
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,500
do not become public record, as he was saying, there are some things you can't talk about,

258
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:55,340
like conversations we had in between breaks and stuff like that, obviously, any of that

259
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:59,340
kind of stuff, anybody's actual that, you know, the thing is, is you go into a deposition

260
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:03,980
room, and 90% of what you do is what they call on the record, there's a there's a videotape

261
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,660
role, and there's a transcript role, and there's somebody typing it all down 10% of that downtime

262
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,660
is off the record.

263
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,180
And there are things that happen there to off the record, obviously, anything off the

264
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,220
record is not something Dan can talk about.

265
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:17,380
But now we're in a position where, and I'm glad free speech made, or I'm sorry, info

266
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:21,020
wars, I call them by their corporate name, sometimes free speech systems, which is just

267
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,620
the irony of ironies that they named themselves that.

268
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:28,200
But the fact that info wars made the choice or however they came to the conclusion to

269
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,540
not make these depositions confidential, I am very glad they did.

270
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:36,600
Because I believe that for those people who are following this case, who understand the

271
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,860
public importance of it, there is a lot of enlightening information that oh, no, like

272
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,580
yeah, these are going to be an interesting discussion.

273
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,900
Yeah, so I'm glad Dan can do that.

274
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,620
And it's it's what part of the wonderful parts of our process is that when things do get

275
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:55,300
into the public record this way, that court proceedings can be critically discussed.

276
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,020
And that's something I'm glad Dan can do.

277
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,820
But yeah, there are there are certain things that there may be gaps.

278
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,300
I'm sure Jordan will sometimes ask a question that Dan would have to be no comment to.

279
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:07,780
I'll probably if that comes up, I'll probably edit it out.

280
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:12,060
You'll never know.

281
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:18,580
But yeah, like if you ask me what Alex smelled like, I'll have to cut that out.

282
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:24,460
Like a gently lavender wind, like, like the like freshly done laundry in the spring of

283
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,460
normally.

284
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,460
Yeah.

285
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:31,640
No, none of that kind of, you know, then that's the thing is, is you, Dan got to see sort

286
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,900
of an inside baseball process of a legal proceeding that a lot of people don't normally get to

287
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:40,320
see, which is how a deposition is done, because that's like testimony, but it's not in a courtroom.

288
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,980
You know, we were we were in a friend of mine's law office in Austin.

289
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:48,700
And and, you know, you're in this very tight quarters, where you have a videographer in

290
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:52,940
the room, a court reporters, taking everything down, you've got all your pairs of lawyers

291
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:57,380
in the room, and you've got the witness, and you're all in this this room together.

292
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:01,060
And and, you know, for one of these depositions, I think when as long as like, five, six hours.

293
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:05,820
Yeah, yeah, the corporate representative one with Daria was most of a day.

294
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,140
Yeah, yeah, it was very interesting.

295
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:13,260
But I'm actually, you know, the thing is, we've talked about these depositions in the

296
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,020
course of us talking for consulting purposes.

297
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:21,000
And I'm, I was, that's all from our legal perspective of what we're doing in the case.

298
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,940
And I'm actually interested as these become a little more public to hear what people's

299
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:31,820
reaction to them in a broader sense is, yeah, because unlike, I think, Jones's first deposition

300
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,480
and the first corporate representatives and all of that, which was very shallow and very

301
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,460
guarded and very mockery, I mean, it was just a kind of a farce of a thing.

302
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:42,900
This is a farce in its own way to slightly different farce.

303
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,820
Yeah, slightly different farce is how I would describe it.

304
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,820
Comedy of errors.

305
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:51,920
We, we all let your audience know that we recently had brought a motion for sanctions

306
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,700
based on this corporate deposition.

307
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,980
One with Daria with Daria, correct.

308
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:01,740
And that was because they had been ordered four times to give a corporate deposition

309
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,980
in the course of these cases, the first two times, they just didn't show up.

310
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,880
And then the second two times they sent Rob do both times and Rob do seem to be oblivious

311
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,640
to the fact that the law required him to prepare in any way for this deposition.

312
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,780
I think what you meant to say was a fucking legend.

313
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,780
Yeah.

314
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:23,020
That's going to go down in history as making one of the greatest episodes of all time.

315
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,420
They call Rob the sharp shooter.

316
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:32,940
I'll say like this was on for those because they also tuned into the hearings that we

317
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,940
have.

318
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,420
We had a hearing on Friday and our judges straight out said it was, it was a mockery.

319
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:41,340
It was an offensive deposition.

320
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,340
The Daria one.

321
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,340
Yes, exactly.

322
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:47,140
In the wake of an already offensive depositions from Rob do.

323
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,460
And so it's like to get your act together for this, they still haven't done it.

324
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,800
I think you'll see that.

325
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,100
But we recently brought that motion.

326
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,540
We had a hearing on Friday.

327
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,240
They were sanctioned yet again.

328
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,940
And I want to say that this is now, gosh, maybe the seventh or eighth time they've been

329
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,060
fined before ever actually having the trial happen.

330
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,340
It's pretty wild.

331
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:09,140
And so we're still trying to see what the full fallout of all of that is going to be.

332
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,260
But yeah, this did, this did not go well for them.

333
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:19,080
It it felt, you know, it's a, I was disappointed when I showed up in Austin because you'd only

334
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,860
told me there was a corporate representative.

335
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,300
I didn't know who it was going to be.

336
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,780
I was really excited for the possibility that we'd get another round with do.

337
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,780
Yeah.

338
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,100
I thought that would be a lot of fun.

339
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,840
And then learning that it was going to be Daria, I was like, man, she might be competent

340
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,100
at this.

341
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,380
And then it was so interesting.

342
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:39,140
And we'll get into this, like in more minute detail in the course of the episode, but it's

343
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,940
Rob Dewish, but in a very different way.

344
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,940
It's beautiful.

345
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,940
Yeah.

346
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,940
It's very different.

347
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,940
It's shocking.

348
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,940
Yeah.

349
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,940
It's, it's really interesting.

350
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,940
And I'm yeah.

351
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,500
So like I say, that's why I'm glad it's public.

352
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:56,440
I think that this was, I want to say this, you know, for the audience's benefit, I think

353
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,740
this was one of the more difficult things that I've had to do.

354
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:04,260
First of all, to not talk about this for this.

355
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:09,440
We did this at the beginning of December was when I came down to Austin and not being able

356
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,780
to mention it or not being able to be like, but you know, all the information that I had

357
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,660
that was in those depositions, I had to not know.

358
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,020
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

359
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,120
That was hard for you, but that's easy for you.

360
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,440
I didn't say anything, which is the real fucking accomplishment.

361
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,780
That's what I want to get across here.

362
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,100
Somehow I didn't break.

363
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:34,580
Who are you going to tell your dog?

364
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:41,340
But like it was really challenging and I'm glad that, you know, we're on the other side

365
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:44,600
of it now because it is a bit of a relief.

366
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,560
And then the second, the second challenge was really like questioning prior to agreeing

367
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:59,060
to come down, whether or not this was an instance of like sort of affecting the content of the

368
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,060
thing we're covering.

369
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,060
Right, right, right, right.

370
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:04,820
And I really wrestled with that and I struggled with that question because it's been something

371
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:10,180
that we've, a policy that we've tried to maintain as it relates to Alex's show.

372
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:15,260
Yeah, we don't want people to call in to his show to fuck with him in order for us to cover

373
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,820
it on the show.

374
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:23,900
And I felt like this was important enough of a thing to do and it's a once in a lifetime

375
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,900
opportunity.

376
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,900
Of course.

377
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:30,980
Anything I can do to help the families is something that is more important than our

378
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,980
show per se.

379
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:38,580
I mean it's hard to say no to fighting evil, so there is that.

380
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:45,980
And also it wouldn't have the same actual presentation as someone prank calling him

381
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,980
or something.

382
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,780
It wasn't a prank.

383
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:55,300
This was assisting in these are questions that may be fruitful to ask, these are ideas

384
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,300
to check in on.

385
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:04,180
And I think that is materially different than the way that we've had a non-engagement

386
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,180
in the past.

387
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:09,000
I think it's close, but I think it's on the right side of it.

388
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,260
This case is so different than most forms of litigation because of its subject matter

389
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:20,900
that when you need, for instance, an expert on pipe metallurgy and a plant explosion,

390
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:26,180
there's no chance that that same person is going to be critically covering in the media.

391
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,180
That's not a thing.

392
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:31,260
But what's interesting about this case is when you're in this kind of media litigation,

393
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:36,060
the only people in this country who are genuine bonafide experts on Jones are those who have

394
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:39,920
followed his media career and engaged in the criticism to fight back against it.

395
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:44,860
And in our first depositions, one of our consultants had been Brooke Benkowski, who was the managing

396
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:50,780
editor of Snopes, now at truthoffiction.com, and she had been one of, I feel like she's

397
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:56,500
sort of a modern day Cassandra of, she was saying in 2015, 2014, here's what fake news

398
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,700
and what Infowars is doing is about to do to our country.

399
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,940
And so I knew from the get-go, and she had sat in on some of our depositions too, and

400
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:11,100
we had the same sort of discussion of there is this scientist view that says the subject

401
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:16,300
of your inquiry should be kept in isolation and you shouldn't let your interactions with

402
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,900
it affect your observations of it, right?

403
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:24,380
And then there's the idea that Brooke had, which is, no, the entire point of critically

404
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:29,260
covering him and learning more information about him is because of the danger of harm

405
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,500
that he presents to people like my clients.

406
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,700
And therefore to offer that expertise to people who are trying to vindicate that in the court

407
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,380
of law is a noble calling, is how she felt about it.

408
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:42,440
And that's why I felt that this is such a different type of litigation.

409
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,060
It's so strange that way.

410
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:47,700
And I think it makes it very difficult for people in your position to ever testify at

411
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,700
trial because of that, right?

412
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:53,780
I could be impeached as a witness so easily based on a hundred things I've said on my

413
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,780
podcast.

414
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,820
I mean, like, why should we believe anything you said, right?

415
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:00,340
Like it doesn't, there's no, exactly, but I mean, I'll stand by everything I've ever

416
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,820
said.

417
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:05,260
I think I screamed at you about alien phones getting pregnant.

418
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,260
Yes.

419
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,260
We have been there.

420
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,260
Yeah.

421
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,260
Yeah.

422
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,260
We'll end up playing on the stand.

423
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,260
It's no good.

424
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,260
Yeah.

425
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,160
No, I'm thinking about Jordan on the witness stand and I'm just thinking bad law and order

426
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,820
episodes like the witness starts shaking.

427
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,820
Let's go.

428
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,020
No, it would just be, you, you can't handle the truth.

429
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,020
You just do that.

430
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,020
That'd be...

431
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,260
No, that's not nice.

432
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,640
I would be far more clever.

433
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,980
You would do the scene from the critic.

434
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,980
Oh yeah.

435
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,500
Mustard gives me gas as does taffy.

436
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,500
All right.

437
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,500
Very obscure reference.

438
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,040
We got people to testify as experts.

439
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,200
We had to go to academia, right?

440
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,620
Like to people who were far out of it, right?

441
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:47,740
Who kind of view it from a distance and as much as they study his effects, it's legit

442
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,740
true.

443
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:52,260
Nobody in this country has studied the internal mechanics of how info wars works, how its

444
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,140
stories works, how its editorial process works.

445
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,140
Nobody's done it like you guys.

446
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:00,140
I mean, it's just, there's nobody who's in, and it's, it's weird that there was this vacuum

447
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,260
that when people saw what you were doing, the reason it was so well received is because

448
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,160
there is such a need for that.

449
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,300
Nobody has gone into that kind of depth.

450
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,900
So that's how you became what you are.

451
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,220
So I'm glad you're gonna be able to do this today.

452
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,460
And I'm going to jump out the window.

453
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:17,300
See, I thought, I thought the way it worked was if you're fighting against Godzilla, you

454
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,660
don't go to like a regular old army or whatever.

455
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,300
You have to get Mothra, right?

456
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:27,300
So if you're going to depose Alex Jones, you can't just go with some expert somewhere at

457
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:35,740
a goddamn university, you can be King Ghidorah.

458
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:40,780
This might surprise you, Jordan, but my, my litigation strategy has not been mostly informed

459
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:45,300
by 1960s RKO Tokyo pictures with monster movies.

460
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:49,060
And so we've had some different choices in there and Godzilla did not immediately spring

461
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,820
to mind when I thought of Dan.

462
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:56,620
I guess we have some differences of opinion that may not be resolved at this time.

463
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:02,060
I think, I think Mark's strategy probably speaks for itself, of not approaching this

464
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,740
like a Godzilla movie.

465
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:09,940
Well, I want to say thanks for inviting me to do this.

466
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:14,500
And also thanks for coming to do this little intro piece.

467
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:21,860
I think it's important to, you know, recognize some of the, the, the can'ts of, of what's

468
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,860
going to come up right now.

469
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,820
And laying the ground rules is important.

470
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:30,140
And I don't think I could have explained how this was made public record.

471
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:34,220
I don't know if I fully understood it.

472
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,220
Here's the best part.

473
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,420
I don't think info was fully understood it.

474
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:43,380
That's the hilarious part is it was the one they proposed.

475
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:47,260
And I don't think they understood it, but they just, it keeps happening.

476
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,140
I mean, it's the same fun for every deposition.

477
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:53,020
So, you know, if that's where they stand, they want to let it all be public.

478
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,100
And they've said that from the beginning, you know, we've had, we've have documentary

479
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,180
crews covering every court proceeding.

480
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,420
We have HBO's film and everything.

481
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,220
And they've been receptive to that.

482
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:07,060
And nobody has even asked for a gag order because gosh, look at what Jones is saying.

483
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:10,500
I mean, if you just, if you just turn on his show any day when he talks about this, wow,

484
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,920
it's out the window.

485
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:17,580
So it's, it's nice to counterbalance that with a, with a good thorough and non shallow

486
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,260
look at what actually happened in those rooms on those transcripts that day.

487
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,260
I'm glad you're going to do it.

488
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,260
Well, awesome.

489
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:26,460
I think, I think on that note, if, unless you have anything else to add, we should get

490
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:34,460
to that, uh, thorough, uh, look at these, uh, these depositions now, kick the tires,

491
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,460
get it rolling guys.

492
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,460
All right.

493
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,460
Thank you so much, Mark.

494
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:40,260
Thank you for having me.

495
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,980
So that's the, uh, that's the, the setup for this rundown.

496
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,980
Yup.

497
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,980
Uh, so I was there.

498
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,980
Yup.

499
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,980
Yup.

500
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:48,980
You were there.

501
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,980
I knew about it.

502
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,980
Uh, can't, uh, hide that or mask that.

503
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:57,580
I considered the, uh, the idea of like just going over these and not mentioning that I

504
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,580
was there.

505
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,580
Right.

506
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,580
Right.

507
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,580
Right.

508
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,580
I felt like that was very dishonest.

509
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,580
Yeah.

510
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,580
That'd be a little disingenuous there.

511
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,860
And the transcripts of these, uh, depositions are, my name is in them.

512
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:12,740
So if someone were to stumble across that, it would have the real air of impropriety

513
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,180
that I would have covered them and not brought that up.

514
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,180
Yeah.

515
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:21,620
You know, it would, it would almost necessitate a show about us with a host so dedicated as

516
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:26,540
to find the transcripts from this deposition and to discover that you were there.

517
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,540
Probably Harrison Smith.

518
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,540
Yeah.

519
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,540
It's probably who would do it.

520
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,540
Pretty sure.

521
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:36,780
So today what we're going to be doing is we're going to be going over, uh, the two depositions.

522
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:40,260
One is the corporate representative Daria Karpova, right?

523
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:51,780
The Russian Daria, Alex's assistant, uh, mysterious cake song, a very mysterious person in the

524
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,980
world of info Wars.

525
00:32:52,980 --> 00:33:00,840
And now we get to see what she has to say for about six hours is a long day.

526
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,260
And then the other deposition is of Alex himself.

527
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:09,340
And we were going to be going over Alex's first and then Daria's for sort of structural

528
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,340
reasons.

529
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:15,460
Um, and, uh, here Jordan is an out of context drop from Alex's deposition.

530
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,980
You know who that is?

531
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:18,980
No.

532
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,540
Ah, liar.

533
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:24,620
We know that to be a lie.

534
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,940
Alex saying under oath that he doesn't know who Jar Jar Binks is.

535
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,180
How dare he?

536
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,320
Alex knows that he has a Caribbean black accent.

537
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,740
Alex knows damn well who Jar Jar Binks is.

538
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:40,620
So um, we start off the deposition, Mark is bringing up, uh, some of the, uh, talking

539
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,260
about Sandy hook, uh, stuff.

540
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:46,900
And Alex gave us his response, um, to this sort of general question.

541
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,780
One of the things you just talked about is that you have since this lawsuit has started,

542
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,300
you've said some things about Sandy hook, correct?

543
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:58,220
I've said things about organizations and groups that want to get rid of the first amendment,

544
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,860
trying to use me as a case to do it.

545
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,860
Okay.

546
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,900
Well, what I'm really talking about is you've said things about Sandy hook itself, correct?

547
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:08,340
I have, I have talked about, um, I mean, I've talked about the coverage surrounding it and

548
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,820
the lawsuits and that ongoing process.

549
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,820
Yes.

550
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,380
Um, well I actually want to ask you about a little something else.

551
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,860
Um, w w hold on, back up for a second.

552
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:22,640
One thing that you have said a few times is that in terms of when you did say that Sandy

553
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:26,540
hook was completely fake, synthetic, there were actors, et cetera.

554
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:30,100
You've said that you've apologized for that, correct?

555
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,460
Well first off, I said, I could see how people see that.

556
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:38,140
And I also, um, when people said, please apologize to us.

557
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:43,960
And I'd seen some of the anomalies that I think were wrong, uh, that weren't what people

558
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,960
were questioning online.

559
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,100
Then I'm like, yeah, of course, I'm sorry for, for questioning, uh, Sandy hook, but

560
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,580
it wasn't intended, you know, in a false way.

561
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:54,160
I mean, I really thought maybe it didn't happen.

562
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:59,120
And then, and then the attacks intensified and people began falsely saying that I was

563
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:03,880
currently saying those things and then exaggerating what I'd said as a way as a political weapon

564
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:08,380
that Hillary Clinton was using to beat me over the head with it in 2016 on record and

565
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:14,700
run national political ads, uh, against me playing edited tapes of me talking about Sandy

566
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,700
hook.

567
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,700
Okay.

568
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,700
First of all, objection non-responsive.

569
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:24,140
There are a couple of moments, and this is something that does happens a bit where, um,

570
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:28,000
you know, there's an objection of non-responsive cause you're just rambling about some first

571
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,580
of all, first of all, the question is, you know, you've talked about Sandy hook itself

572
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:40,520
after you, well, well, well, well, well, now look, Hillary Clinton wanted to use me as

573
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,520
a pillory.

574
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:46,300
Now what you Hillary's yes or no question actually involves Hillary Clinton and here's

575
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,300
where we begin.

576
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,300
Yes.

577
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:53,100
And there, there are a couple of times where it it's just like, it's, uh, it's out, it's

578
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,100
outrageous.

579
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,100
Yeah.

580
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:59,160
Mark will have to ask, uh, uh, uh, between Alex and Dario sometimes like, do you know

581
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,420
what question you're answering?

582
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:05,740
And there's slight confusion, repeat words back to me.

583
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,740
Right.

584
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:12,500
And so, you know, the question then comes up of like, you're saying this is your, your

585
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:16,880
understanding of how you covered Sandy hook and then we're going to be able to play for

586
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,100
the jury.

587
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,100
The opposite.

588
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,100
Right.

589
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,100
Right.

590
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:24,500
So why should they not see you as a liar?

591
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,500
Good question.

592
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,500
Yeah.

593
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,500
And so here's, here's where Alex goes with that.

594
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,500
Okay.

595
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,500
First of all, objection, non-responsive.

596
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:35,500
Second of all, you, Mr. Jones, you understand this jury is going to watch the videos of

597
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:41,260
you saying unequivocally, not, I see how people could think this, but unequivocally saying

598
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:45,720
Sandy hook completely or no, Mr. Jones, you don't get to interrupt me.

599
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,720
You understand that, sir?

600
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,900
You're here to answer questions for this jury and I want you to listen to the questions.

601
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:56,660
You know, this jury is going to watch videos of you saying multiple times over and over

602
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:00,620
again, Sandy hook is completely fake, completely synthetic.

603
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,060
It is not real.

604
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,060
Right.

605
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:07,180
And you're going to sit here in this chair and say, Oh, actually what I said, actually

606
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:11,320
what I said is I could see how some other people could think it was fake.

607
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:15,820
You know, the jury's going to see those videos and you know, they're going to hear your words.

608
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:19,300
Do you think that they should take you seriously whatsoever when they can see you saying the

609
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,700
things you said you didn't say?

610
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:28,940
I know, I know that the jury's going to say, I always heard that people are innocent until

611
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:33,380
proven guilty, not guilty until proven how guilty they choose and that the system's actually

612
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,620
scared for me to put on evidence.

613
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:38,680
The truth is deep down, I have still have real questions about Sandy hook and a lot

614
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,680
of the anomalies.

615
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,680
Yeah.

616
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,680
Now's the time to bring that up.

617
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,980
And the CIA visiting Adam Lanza before it happened and the FBI that was in mainstream

618
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:49,860
news and just all the bizarreness that went on.

619
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:53,700
The public still has real questions, just like to do about Jussie Smollett or the Roe

620
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:59,260
V. Wade baby that never actually died or WMDs in Iraq or just the Gulf of Tonkin or operation

621
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:04,860
Northwoods or Bubba Wallace or, or, you know, so many of these things that have happened,

622
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:08,240
most of these hate crimes and type things end up being false flags.

623
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,940
So I still, when I look at events, question and say, could this, could this be staged?

624
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,340
And we look for telltale signs.

625
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,340
What does that mean?

626
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,700
Um, I, I, here's what it means.

627
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:23,520
It means that he is going to take some lettuce and cheese and put it between two big slices

628
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:29,020
of chicken and call that a sandwich because he's doubling down.

629
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:34,300
This is such a bizarre like response to this question because I understand that what he's

630
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:39,060
trying to say is that like, Hey, events sometimes are suspicious and people should ask questions

631
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,060
about them.

632
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,060
Sure.

633
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:45,100
But then his list, like the Roe V. Wade baby, that's just a situation where he doesn't understand

634
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,500
the conversation.

635
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,620
People didn't think that the Roe V. Wade baby was dead.

636
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,620
That's the whole point of the case.

637
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,620
Right.

638
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,620
Right.

639
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,620
Over this.

640
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,140
And this was one of the storylines that was kind of a big talking point for Alex in the

641
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:58,780
beginning of December, which is why it's appearing in this deposition.

642
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:01,260
But I'm pretty sure you've been talking about it on air recently.

643
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,260
Yeah.

644
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,260
We have.

645
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,260
Yeah.

646
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,580
The Roe V. Wade baby was DB Cooper though.

647
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,980
So I think he does believe that that is a false flag.

648
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,980
Everything's connected, man.

649
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:10,980
Yeah, exactly.

650
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:11,980
It has to be.

651
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:12,980
So you've got that.

652
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,820
That's just him misunderstanding things.

653
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:21,180
And then you have the Gulf of Tonkin, the WFDs in Iraq.

654
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,180
Why wouldn't you?

655
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:26,500
And that is in the same conversation as Jussie Smollett and Bubba Wallace.

656
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,500
Yeah.

657
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:33,660
Two examples of racially based antagonistic narratives that he has.

658
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:40,140
I don't know if Bubba Wallace's situation, the NASCAR garage, is on the scale of lying

659
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,420
about weapons of mass destruction.

660
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:45,300
I would say it's different.

661
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:53,140
I would also say that now, in the deposition for damages, for the case you've already lost,

662
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:57,580
not the best time to say I still have questions about whether it's not happening.

663
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,580
It's a strange move.

664
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:03,420
But more to the point, what I'm trying to say is he's giving

665
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,420
these examples.

666
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:08,820
Then he's like, all of these hate crimes end up being staged or whatever.

667
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:14,460
And then are you comparing, is Sandy Hook a hate crime to you?

668
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,140
Is this the connective tissue?

669
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,380
It makes no sense.

670
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,380
It's just-

671
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:21,380
I mean, all crimes involve hate.

672
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:25,300
So aren't all hate crimes crimes and crimes hate crimes?

673
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,700
Let me hit that blunt.

674
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,700
Yeah.

675
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:33,180
I mean, it's a strange tactic that's being deployed and I would have advised against

676
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,180
it.

677
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,180
No, I think it's great.

678
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,180
Okay.

679
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,180
I'm loving it so far.

680
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,180
We're two clips in.

681
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,180
I think he's going to win this thing.

682
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:43,700
There does seem to be a trend of, like you're describing it as doubling down, where it's

683
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,660
like, why don't we just reopen this wound?

684
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,980
Yeah, I bet, Phoenix.

685
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:47,980
Why not?

686
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,660
It's really, I mean, we've already lost.

687
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,660
Yeah.

688
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,860
So Mark kind of pushes on that angle.

689
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:56,940
All right, Mr. Johnson, here's a video of you.

690
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:01,660
Just like the New York Times lying about WMDs on purpose and all those are evil things.

691
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:07,500
No, but I questioned one of the big events they hyped up because of a lot of the anomalies

692
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,100
and I have a right to question that.

693
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:14,020
In fact, I for a while thought it didn't happen, then I thought I probably did it now, seeing

694
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:20,260
how synthetic everything is and my original instinct, maybe Alex Jones is always.

695
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:23,460
I'm pretty much right 99% of the time folks, so are you.

696
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:27,460
I mean, we all know this is easy to look at and see what's happening.

697
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:31,220
So now you're back to feeding your audience this lie about Sandy Hook, right?

698
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,220
Correct.

699
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:38,460
No, that's an that I'm proud of the video and I'm proud of my statement and it's full

700
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:43,860
context and we'll be able to show the jury and they will see what I had to say and see

701
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:48,300
that I'm speaking up for the American tradition of being able to challenge authority stories

702
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:51,460
that almost always turn out to be at least partially wrong.

703
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:54,420
Please keep that promise and play the whole October 1st video.

704
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,420
Please keep that promise.

705
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,420
Okay.

706
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:59,860
I will be vindicated.

707
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:04,420
I'm liking, I'm liking Mark's, you can hear Mark smiling.

708
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,580
You can hear the smile.

709
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:09,540
If you pay close attention, you can hear a laugh a couple of times too.

710
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:14,300
There is a, a jocular nature going on here.

711
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:20,220
And so this, this is a good, this seems to be a good line of questioning and so this

712
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,220
gets pursued.

713
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:25,520
Like you lost this case by default and so now you're back to suggesting that Sandy Hook

714
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,520
was fake.

715
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,520
Why not?

716
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,020
Because there's probably no consequences for it.

717
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:32,060
You're going to double lose.

718
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:35,060
And so this, this is a pushed on a little.

719
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:38,020
Please keep that promise and play the whole October 1st video.

720
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,020
Please keep that promise.

721
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,020
Okay.

722
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:45,320
But second, what has happened here is now that you got beat in court, now that a default's

723
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,320
been granted.

724
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,320
So I didn't get beat in court.

725
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,500
I got, I got beat by an organized crime syndicate.

726
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:56,500
Now that a default has been granted, you don't have to pretend anymore, do you?

727
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,500
That's what's going on.

728
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,500
Right?

729
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,500
Objection form.

730
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,500
No, that's not what's happened.

731
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:07,620
A death penalty sanction with all the stuff we produced, I believe is a fraud and it's

732
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:10,540
because they're scared of the real evidence coming out and want to be able to tell a jury

733
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:11,700
that this man is guilty.

734
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,700
Now you decide how guilty.

735
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:17,260
No, juries are supposed to decide if someone is guilty or not, period, not how guilty they

736
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,260
are.

737
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:21,220
So you guys can try to do all your anti-free speech stuff.

738
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:23,900
All you're doing is waking up the American people.

739
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:29,340
So there's a, there's a real trend here at the beginning of the deposition of like, like

740
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:32,100
allowing a bit of going back and forth.

741
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:35,020
Let's have a little bit of getting this out of the system.

742
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,020
Sure.

743
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,020
Yeah.

744
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:42,160
There are more, uh, actual solid questions and like pieces of evidence, uh, on the back

745
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,220
end of this.

746
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:48,460
But it almost feels like let's, let's warm up a little with, uh, with some, some sparring

747
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:51,460
because obviously Alex will want to do that the whole time.

748
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:56,740
He kind of bait him a little bit and he, he gets, he gets to throwing out stuff like,

749
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:59,380
you know, Hey, but people do have questions.

750
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:02,820
I'm proud of this statement that maybe I actually was right.

751
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:06,700
It's like when, uh, when I used to host shows, you know, it's like, get all your heckling

752
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,900
down out of the way.

753
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:08,900
I'm up top.

754
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,580
We'll get all, get it all out of your system.

755
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:13,260
Basically Mark asking Alex if he has a birthday coming up.

756
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,260
Totally.

757
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,220
100% anybody celebrating anything.

758
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,220
Yes, absolutely.

759
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,220
Yeah.

760
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:20,620
So this, this line of questioning does even continue.

761
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,940
All you're doing is waking up the American people.

762
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:23,940
All right.

763
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,580
So let's just be honest about what this is.

764
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:30,740
You got mad after you got defaulted and you lashed out by saying that Sandy hook was fake

765
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:31,740
again.

766
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:32,740
That's what happened.

767
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:38,280
No, I have privately, uh, I mean, I've told my crew and I've, I mean, I've, and I've always

768
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:44,620
said I really have real questions about this, but I can't 100% prove it was totally staged,

769
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:50,540
but the CIA was definitely involved and, and that came out and then I was, I was told again

770
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:54,420
by high level folks in the CIA that it was staged back at the time.

771
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:57,940
And so I went with them and also what Wolfgang Halbig said and others.

772
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:01,620
So I really believe that, that, that, that, that it should be looked at.

773
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:04,620
I'm going to guess the CIA person Alex is referring to might be Steve Pachanik.

774
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:05,620
Yes.

775
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,780
I don't think it's an actual real source.

776
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:11,220
No, but Alex has brought up that CIA involvement thing a couple of times.

777
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:14,420
So I want to just touch on that really quickly because I don't think, I'm not even sure if

778
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,700
that came up necessarily in episodes that we've done.

779
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,980
So it might be new to some ears.

780
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:24,020
The CIA wasn't involved in the shooting, but when the FBI released the redacted reports

781
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:29,860
of the investigation, it included interviews with people who knew Adam Lanza and his mother.

782
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,860
There's one interview that they conducted with a person whose name is redacted, which

783
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:37,300
was filed in a report that was dated December 16th, 2012.

784
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:41,660
This was a friend of Lanza's mother, Nancy, who had her over to the house periodically.

785
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:46,860
Quote, when Adam Lanza was in ninth grade, Nancy told Redacted that Adam had hacked into

786
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,780
a government computer system.

787
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:52,300
Adam had made it through the second level of security, and when he tried to breach the

788
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:57,380
third level, the screen went black and the authorities showed up at Lanza's door at 36

789
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,200
Yogananda Street.

790
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:04,380
Nancy believed that the authorities that showed up at her door were either the FBI or CIA.

791
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:08,100
Nancy had to convince the authorities that her son was just very intelligent and was

792
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:11,780
challenging himself to see if he could hack into a government system.

793
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:15,380
If you consider this on the larger picture of that full interview, it's fairly clear

794
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:18,980
that this was not a reliable assessment that Nancy was making.

795
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,860
And that's where the CIA comes from.

796
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:24,740
It's Nancy saying that these people were CIA that showed up.

797
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:28,960
One event that's described in this interview involves that friend leaving invitations to

798
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,020
a dinner party in all of the neighbors' mailboxes.

799
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:36,900
Nancy never RSVP'd, so this person asked why, and Nancy said it was, quote, because there

800
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:41,600
was no return address on the envelope, she had thought there was anthrax in it.

801
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,900
This is what Alex is using as the foundation of his assertion that the CIA was involved

802
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,460
in the Sandy Hook shooting.

803
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:50,680
He's spinning conspiracy theories about the shooting while under oath in the deposition

804
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:54,620
where he's being sued for things related to his spinning of conspiracy theories about

805
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:55,620
the shooting.

806
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:57,340
It just seems like he can't stop.

807
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:01,340
Like it's, I don't even know why you would do this.

808
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:07,420
It works in an argument setting, like if you're arguing with somebody on a podcast or Piers

809
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:12,300
Morgan or something, this is a great strategy to use, but I don't know about in court.

810
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:20,140
Yeah, I'm already at, through the deposition as so far, I'm like, okay, he has clearly

811
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:23,220
established that learning is not a possibility.

812
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,220
You know what I mean?

813
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:25,220
Like it's not going to stop.

814
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:29,040
I think probably learning is counter to his business model, like it probably would have

815
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,540
been a maladaptive strategy early on.

816
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:33,960
Right, right, right, right.

817
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,700
So why change now?

818
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:42,740
Which to me says that if I'm like, hey, here's how we punish this guy.

819
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:45,780
If you want it to stop, you have to bankrupt him.

820
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:48,580
That's the reality of it because he's not going to stop.

821
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:53,780
And if he does stop for the Sandy Hook families, it's just going to go somewhere else and he's

822
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:57,740
not going to learn from the behavior because in the depositions for the behavior, he's

823
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:58,740
already lost.

824
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:00,820
He's doing the behavior.

825
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:07,820
Yeah, it does feel a bit like the dead end in terms of trying to learn a lesson.

826
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:11,740
You got to bankrupt him otherwise there's no lesson to be learned.

827
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:12,740
That's your perspective?

828
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:14,040
That's my perspective.

829
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:20,380
So Alex is pretty mad because he has been defaulted and he's lost these cases by default

830
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:25,300
and he believes that he's complied with everything that's been requested of him.

831
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,300
Of course.

832
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,380
So this turns a little bit embarrassing.

833
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:35,020
You've repeatedly said that this, this court process, this lawsuit, what just happened

834
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:40,900
is all a sham because you turned everything over and that court still defaulted you anyway,

835
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:41,900
right?

836
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:42,900
Yes.

837
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:47,420
Owen Schroyer, you never sent him one deposition, one document request, one thing, and he was

838
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:49,380
defaulted along with me.

839
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:51,900
And if that isn't fraud, then nothing is.

840
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:52,900
Okay, hold on.

841
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,380
I may have to pull this order for you because I need you to understand this.

842
00:48:56,380 --> 00:49:00,220
Do you understand that in Ms. Neil Hessen's case, there was a court order requiring Owen

843
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:01,420
Schroyer to appear for deposition.

844
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:02,940
Do you know that?

845
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:08,140
I know he appeared for deposition yesterday after you asked for it after the default.

846
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:09,140
No, sir.

847
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:16,500
Mr. Jones, do you understand that there was an order in August 31st, 2018 asking Mr. requiring

848
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,300
Owen Schroyer to appear for deposition?

849
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,380
Did you know that?

850
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,020
I don't know what you're talking about.

851
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:23,020
Yeah.

852
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:24,020
You didn't know that.

853
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:26,500
You were doing your show without even knowing what the discovery was.

854
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,500
Yeah.

855
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:30,780
So the claims that Alex is making of like complying with all this stuff when confronted

856
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:37,140
with like, this is something from three and a half, four years ago that you just ignored.

857
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,140
Do you know that?

858
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:39,140
Uh, nope.

859
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:40,140
Don't know that.

860
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:44,660
I mean, I was waiting for him to say what I would have said, which was just like, really?

861
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:46,300
It's been going on that long, huh?

862
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:47,300
Wow.

863
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:48,300
How the time flies.

864
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,540
What a strange trip we've been on guys.

865
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:50,540
Am I right?

866
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:53,500
You know, like let's just stop and take a moment to appreciate where we've all gotten

867
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:54,500
to.

868
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,500
Look, let's just forget about this case.

869
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,500
Isn't it great that you and me have become friends?

870
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,500
We've been doing this for so long.

871
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,500
Let's just go get a drink.

872
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,500
Come on.

873
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:03,360
Look at how many lawyers I've got to meet over the course of this thing.

874
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,360
So many new friends.

875
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,360
Yeah.

876
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,360
Yeah.

877
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,360
Yeah.

878
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,360
The real default judgment was the friends we made along the way.

879
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,360
Yeah.

880
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,360
And actually I was thinking about this.

881
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:14,360
I want to, I want to make one really important clarification in terms of the preparation

882
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,360
of these clips.

883
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:20,620
I have done a little editing, but the only things that I've cut out are when there'll

884
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:25,180
be a call for an exhibit and then there is a long stretch while the exhibit is being

885
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:26,180
procured.

886
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:27,180
Yeah.

887
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:28,180
Out of a binder.

888
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:31,100
And so there are long stretches of like, just finding shit basically.

889
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:37,260
So I've cut those down for the sake of listening, but not taking out things that would provide

890
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:41,460
greater context or lead to a misrepresentation.

891
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:44,820
They're available if you want to go check Dan's work.

892
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:46,820
I just want to, but I did do that.

893
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:47,820
Whereas I usually don't.

894
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:48,820
No, I understand.

895
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:51,420
So I just wanted to be totally clear understood.

896
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:56,620
So Alex has been confronted with the fact that Owen Troyer did in fact get called for

897
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:01,820
a deposition in 2018 and they just ignored it and turns out they ignored a whole bunch

898
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:02,820
more stuff.

899
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:05,800
So you got on your show without even knowing what the discovery was.

900
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:09,940
Did you know in Mr. and Mr. Mr. Posner's case and Mrs. Dela Rosa's case, do you understand

901
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:11,740
they're suing you right?

902
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:13,060
I've never said her name.

903
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:14,060
I'm never going to say it.

904
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:15,620
I'm not asking you about what you said.

905
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:18,900
You know, they're suing you, don't you?

906
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:19,900
Correct.

907
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:20,900
Let's just start there.

908
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:21,900
You know, there's a law.

909
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:22,900
I know I didn't get a jury trial.

910
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:23,900
I know a judge said I was guilty.

911
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,220
I don't believe that I live in the Soviet union.

912
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:27,880
Mr. Jones, you're not answering the questions.

913
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:28,880
Let's just admit it right now.

914
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,060
You're not answering questions.

915
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:34,980
I'm asking you, do you know that Leonard Posner and Veronique Dela Rosa sued you?

916
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:35,980
Do you know that?

917
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:36,980
Yes.

918
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:37,980
Okay.

919
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:38,980
Do you know they served you discovery?

920
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:39,980
I believe so.

921
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:40,980
Yes.

922
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:41,980
Yeah.

923
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:43,980
You know, you didn't answer it ever.

924
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:44,980
That's not true.

925
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:45,980
It is true.

926
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:46,980
Mr. Jones.

927
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:48,860
And I bet you, when you go back and you talk to your lawyers, you're going to find out

928
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:50,860
a lot of things you don't know.

929
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:54,740
It's I'm not going to tell you, Mr. Jones, not like you got a bad grade on your homework.

930
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:56,120
Like you didn't turn it in.

931
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,940
You didn't know that.

932
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:01,020
What were the depositions we had and all the 81,000 documents?

933
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,340
That's in Mrs. Lewis' case.

934
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:03,980
That's when Mr. Barnes came in.

935
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:05,280
That's when, and we'll get to that.

936
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,280
Let's talk about that in a minute.

937
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,860
But first let's take on Mr. Posner and Mrs. Dela Rosa's case.

938
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:12,620
You don't know that you never answered discovery, do you?

939
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:15,100
You don't even know that.

940
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,100
Correct?

941
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:18,260
Again, I don't have that stuff in front of me.

942
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,260
Right.

943
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:20,260
Ooh.

944
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:21,260
Ah.

945
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:26,900
A little bit of a less gusto and bravado once the actual like factual information is.

946
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:27,900
That's not good.

947
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:30,020
No, that's going to break your heart.

948
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:31,020
Yeah.

949
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:32,020
Yeah.

950
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:40,060
And I see Mark broke out his tap dancing shoes upon which to dance on Alex's grave, I believe.

951
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:45,140
I think you can tell there's a tone of this is after the case is already decided and this

952
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:49,620
isn't the first time that Mark's been, like he's deposed Alex.

953
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:55,540
And so there is kind of a familiarity that maybe wouldn't be there in the first time

954
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:58,660
that they interacted.

955
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:04,540
And so the list just goes on of stuff in discovery that Alex claims he was on.

956
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:08,060
He did everything for, but did not.

957
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:12,340
You've got Mr. Posner and Mrs. Delarosa's case where you didn't even answer discovery.

958
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:16,140
You got Mr. Hessen's defamation case where you didn't show up for defamation, answer

959
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:17,900
any discovery or show up for deposition.

960
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,340
Neither did Mr. Schroyer, neither did the company.

961
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:23,940
You've got Mrs. Lewis' case where you wrote an affidavit saying your lawyer screwed it

962
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:28,620
up and you've got Mr. Hessen's IED case, which you just got sanctioned because you sent Rob

963
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:31,060
Dew to the deposition and he couldn't answer any questions.

964
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:35,900
And if all of those things are true, when you get onto your show and you tell your show

965
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:40,460
that this is all just a kangaroo court and you completely complied but got railroaded,

966
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,460
that's not true.

967
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:42,460
None of that's true.

968
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:43,460
No, it is true.

969
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:46,260
I mean, I remember giving you guys all sorts of stuff and you would say you hadn't been

970
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,540
given it or you weren't given, wasn't given the way you wanted it.

971
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:52,020
It's just, I mean, look, it should be on the issues of what did I say on air?

972
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,020
It should be maybe-

973
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:55,220
You don't want it to be on that either.

974
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:57,500
That's not fair, is it?

975
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:03,780
Mr. Delarosa, excuse me, Mrs. Delarosa and Mr. Posner have the right to ask you questions,

976
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:04,780
right?

977
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:07,060
Do you agree with that or not?

978
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:08,900
I mean, I've sat for these depositions.

979
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:13,420
You have not sat for a deposition for Mrs. Delarosa and Mr. Posner.

980
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,860
And they have that right, don't they?

981
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:17,740
I don't know.

982
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:19,540
You really don't, do you?

983
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:24,080
That is probably a difficult question for Alex to ask or to answer either in the affirmative

984
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:29,540
or the negative because I think either introduces more questions that he probably doesn't want

985
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:32,340
to answer.

986
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:34,540
What a bad day.

987
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:40,940
Just especially in your deposition where you're fucked up, to have the lawyer remind you you're

988
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:44,620
not even a third of the way through the number of cases-

989
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:45,620
That you've ignored.

990
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:46,620
That you have ignored.

991
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:48,900
Yeah, it would be challenging.

992
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:53,080
Listen, not only have you been getting an F in my class, I'm here to talk to you about

993
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,700
your other classes as well.

994
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:58,340
And now we should also talk about a class that you took previously, which is in this

995
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:01,100
metaphor the last deposition.

996
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:05,880
We went over that, and if you'll recall, there were a number of times where citation and

997
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:11,660
sourcing was discussed, and Alex would make a claim in a video or on his show, and Mark

998
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:14,180
would ask, where did you get that from?

999
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:19,780
And Alex, he responded on a number of these cases with, I don't know, but I could get

1000
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:20,780
it for you.

1001
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:23,300
If you give me time, I could get it for you.

1002
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:24,300
How did we do?

1003
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:25,780
Well, we get the circles back.

1004
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:32,700
Do you remember we talked in that last deposition about the Bloomberg email, where Bloomberg

1005
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:36,820
sent an email out to his people, said, get ready in the next 24 hours, there's going

1006
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:37,820
to be a big event.

1007
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:38,820
You remember that?

1008
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:40,660
That was a new story, yeah.

1009
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:43,700
Yeah, and then we talked about it for a while because you had brought that up to me.

1010
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:46,980
You were like, look, I don't have the email itself.

1011
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,580
That was something I was reporting on.

1012
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:50,820
I had, there was a story about it and I was reporting on it.

1013
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:51,820
You remember that?

1014
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:52,820
I do.

1015
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:54,860
And then you remember you told me you could find it for me, right?

1016
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:55,860
Yeah.

1017
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:56,860
I believe I said that.

1018
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:59,380
And then you never gave it to me, did you?

1019
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:00,380
I'd be honest with you, Banks.

1020
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:02,340
And you don't really inhabit much of my mind.

1021
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:07,260
You don't have much respect for any of this process, do you?

1022
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:09,660
I don't think you have respect for America or anything.

1023
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:15,220
Oh my God, what a whiny baby.

1024
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:16,220
But nailed it.

1025
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:17,220
Oh, he did.

1026
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:18,220
He did.

1027
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:19,220
That was well delivered.

1028
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:20,220
I'm going to give him that.

1029
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:22,620
You don't have respect for the proceedings that are going on here.

1030
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:25,500
You don't have respect for America.

1031
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,140
That was his, that was his, you can't handle the truth moment.

1032
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:29,140
And I get it.

1033
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:30,140
He earned it.

1034
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:35,740
But it was also delivered, like that line, you know, you couldn't handle the truth or

1035
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:36,740
whatever.

1036
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:39,740
If it was delivered like that, it would not be a classic movie moment.

1037
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:40,740
No, no, no, no.

1038
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:41,740
Absolutely not.

1039
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:42,740
If it was sort of muttered.

1040
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:43,740
If it was a whiny baby doing it.

1041
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:44,740
You can't handle the truth.

1042
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:45,740
You can't handle the truth.

1043
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:46,740
Yeah.

1044
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:47,740
Not as electric.

1045
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:48,740
No.

1046
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:49,740
Your truth is dumb.

1047
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:54,260
Yeah, that was, that was pretty interesting.

1048
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:59,420
That response I think was shocking.

1049
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:03,580
It's just outright combativeness.

1050
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:07,820
It's fun for the sake of a podcast or maybe a show, but like it's...

1051
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:09,940
For the sake of a functioning legal system.

1052
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:10,940
Terrible.

1053
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:11,940
It's awful.

1054
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:13,020
I don't think it impresses anybody.

1055
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:14,020
Really bad.

1056
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:15,020
Really, really bad.

1057
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:23,700
So now we get to a discussion about Alex's audience size, and this might've been a mistake

1058
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:24,700
on Alex's part.

1059
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:30,220
I want to play you a piece of audio from your radio show.

1060
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:33,580
So there's not going to be any video to show you, but this is going to be exhibit three.

1061
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:42,540
It was 3% that volunteered for Revolutionary War, back in 1776, but if you look at the

1062
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:50,300
Infowars audience, it's maybe 10% of the United States, another 10% or so worldwide, the 10%

1063
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:53,180
of that's a conservative estimate.

1064
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:55,080
That's true.

1065
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,080
That's a guesstimation.

1066
00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:00,960
It's probably a lot higher than that, right?

1067
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,500
I don't know.

1068
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:04,500
So you do...

1069
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:07,740
I need to find an audience and somebody tune in once a month, once a year, once a day.

1070
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:10,140
You're the one who said it, Mr. Jones, you tell me.

1071
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:11,140
It's a very short clip.

1072
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:12,140
I need to know the context.

1073
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:13,140
I need to know...

1074
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:14,700
There's nothing else said about audience in that entire clip.

1075
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:15,700
Okay.

1076
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:16,920
Well, I haven't heard the whole clip.

1077
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:20,740
It's an advertisement for some sort of pill or something.

1078
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:27,100
I'm asking you right now, is 10% of America an accurate representation of Infowars listenership?

1079
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:29,460
That's true, right?

1080
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:31,060
Major media organization.

1081
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:37,620
I mean, I would say a larger percentage than that agree with my worldview, but I mean,

1082
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:42,220
I would say 10% of the countries watch something I've done and agree with me.

1083
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:44,260
And then globally, another 10%, right?

1084
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:45,260
Because you're...

1085
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:49,780
Let me put it this way, Infowars programming is not bound by US borders.

1086
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:51,340
It's the internet's everywhere, right?

1087
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:52,340
Okay.

1088
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:57,100
And so globally, Infowars also has a very large audience, right?

1089
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,700
Maybe 10% of the globe is listening into Infowars, right?

1090
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:07,460
I would imagine 10% of the people in...

1091
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:11,260
That's more hyperbole, but the English speaking world, yeah, I would say so.

1092
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:12,260
Whoa.

1093
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:15,740
So this is a bit of a misstep, I believe, on Alex's part, because he's in a deposition

1094
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:19,900
where the goal is determining the damages he's going to be facing in this case.

1095
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:23,300
One of the relevant questions when it comes to defamation, particularly in a case like

1096
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:28,140
this, where the defamation was broadcast, is how many people were exposed to the defamatory

1097
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:29,380
material.

1098
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:33,660
And the interest of his case should make Alex downplay the size of his audience, but his

1099
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:34,960
ego won't allow it.

1100
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:40,660
So he says under oath that 10% of the English speaking world, or about 135 million people,

1101
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,420
are in his audience.

1102
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:46,100
That's a wide audience that he's essentially admitting would have been exposed to the things

1103
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:51,060
that he's being sued for, which is unclear if he even understood that in this question.

1104
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:52,060
Nope.

1105
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:53,060
It's not like...

1106
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:56,980
Mark is clearly asking these, like, you got a big show, big audience.

1107
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:57,980
No.

1108
00:59:57,980 --> 00:59:59,740
He's writing a puff piece about him.

1109
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:06,420
It's so funny to me because from, I mean, like I can see this perfectly just from Alex's

1110
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:12,860
tone of voice is just like, this is a man who knows something's up, but you're saying

1111
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:17,500
all the right things to make me say the things that I want to say.

1112
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:21,100
So these questions of like, you've got a big audience, don't you, Mr. Jones?

1113
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:25,780
Even the way that Mark has phrased it is, of course Alex is going to say, well, yes,

1114
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:26,780
my audience is huge.

1115
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:29,460
You should smell a trap.

1116
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:30,460
And he does.

1117
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,700
He does smell a trap.

1118
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:32,700
I can hear it.

1119
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:33,700
Not well enough.

1120
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:35,280
But he doesn't know what it is.

1121
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,940
It's so funny to me.

1122
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:38,040
It's so funny to me.

1123
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:41,540
He thinks the trap is coming, but the trap was already sprung, my friend.

1124
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:46,000
Do you think that this lawyer is asking you this question?

1125
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,740
So on the, like, you know, in front of the jury, you can say, Hey, this guy's really

1126
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:50,740
successful.

1127
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:51,740
This guy's so good.

1128
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:52,740
We should be proud of what he's created.

1129
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:57,880
I mean, hey, I think he's a monster, but he did, he's got 135 million regular listeners.

1130
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:58,880
What are you supposed to say?

1131
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:03,100
It's not like you take the time to ask this if it wasn't part of something, a point you're

1132
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:04,100
trying to build.

1133
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:08,640
Alex has just helped that point get built, built in a way that you couldn't possibly

1134
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:12,220
build through like just looking at web traffic or whatever.

1135
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:13,220
Nope.

1136
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:19,100
Alex has done a great favor, I would say, in terms of establishing a self-reported audience

1137
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:20,100
size.

1138
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:23,000
I can just feel how stupid he is.

1139
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
That's brutal.

1140
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,700
So this is a particular highlight for me, Mike down for this, because now that we've

1141
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:32,140
established that there's this really large audience, Mark wants to talk about, you know,

1142
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:36,180
you have a responsibility to not lie to your audience.

1143
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:37,180
This is great.

1144
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:39,300
Hyperbole is something you're very familiar with.

1145
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:40,300
Yes, that's right.

1146
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:42,700
Talk radio is a big part of that, yeah.

1147
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:43,700
Exactly.

1148
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:51,300
So when addressing that audience, your United States and global audience, would you ever

1149
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,300
intentionally lie to them?

1150
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:54,300
No.

1151
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:55,300
Okay.

1152
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:57,300
Let me play you another clip.

1153
01:01:57,300 --> 01:02:04,300
I don't want to ever see little Blitzer hurt, because, well, Blitzer's a human maggot.

1154
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:11,300
I mean, like, you really want to start a fight with us, just, he just can't help it.

1155
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:13,300
Yeah, you do, don't you?

1156
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:15,300
You're begging for it.

1157
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:19,300
You're begging, you're begging to get your guts stomped out hard.

1158
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:25,300
And I don't know if you ever had your guts stomped out, but you don't live after that

1159
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:26,300
happens.

1160
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:29,300
So you, not that I've ever stomped anybody's guts out.

1161
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:32,300
Actually, I have a couple times, it's not too nice.

1162
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:38,300
Takes people a long time to die after you stomp their guts up, but that's no threat

1163
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:39,300
to Wolf Blitzer.

1164
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:42,300
How many people have you physically killed?

1165
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:49,300
None.

1166
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:53,300
Well, I guess we could officially put it to bed.

1167
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:56,300
Alex has not technically probably killed a guy.

1168
01:02:56,300 --> 01:03:03,300
Well, Alex will say under oath that he has not killed anybody.

1169
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:08,300
That's such a great, like, little ping pong exchange of, like, you know, you got this

1170
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:12,300
large audience, it's important to, you can use hyperbole, but it's important not to directly

1171
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:13,300
lie to them, right?

1172
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:14,300
Yes.

1173
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:15,300
Here's you lying.

1174
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:21,300
Oh man, every time, every single time, I answered a question and Mark said, let me play a clip

1175
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:22,300
for you.

1176
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:23,300
I'd throw the desk away.

1177
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,300
I'd be like, fine, you win.

1178
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,300
If you've got a clip, you win.

1179
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:27,300
You get what you want.

1180
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:30,300
Well, I think, I think another response would be like, just sitting there, like, how am

1181
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:32,300
I going to say this is out of context?

1182
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:34,300
How am I going to, hmm.

1183
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:36,300
Can my lawyer yell something?

1184
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:39,300
I stepped on a nail and then run.

1185
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:44,300
So this is the point here in the, in the deposition where we start to get around to some documents

1186
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:46,300
and some exhibits being introduced.

1187
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:51,300
And this one was a bit of a curve ball.

1188
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:53,300
This was a surprise.

1189
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:58,300
It's fair to say that Leonard Posner and Free Speech Systems have had an unfriendly relationship

1190
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:01,300
over the years.

1191
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:06,300
No, I, I'm not, I mean, I don't really follow what he does, so.

1192
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:08,300
And you've done shows about him.

1193
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:11,300
So you do follow him, correct?

1194
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:14,300
I mean, I don't, I never refresh my memory.

1195
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:21,300
So, I will refresh your memory about what you know about Mr. Posner.

1196
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:37,300
Let me show you what it marks as a 10-5. Have you ever seen that before?

1197
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:39,300
No, not that I remember. What is it?

1198
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:44,300
That's the sole document you produced to me just a couple, I guess, a month or two ago

1199
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:48,300
in regard to discovery requests for any documents you had regarding Mr. Posner.

1200
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:51,300
That's the sole document that was in that folder labeled Posner.

1201
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:53,300
That's it.

1202
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:59,300
And that, you will agree with me, appears to be a very large, looks to be about a 187 page

1203
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:01,300
comprehensive background report on Mr. Posner.

1204
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:05,300
Correct.

1205
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:08,300
Oh, I never ran a background report on Posner.

1206
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:11,300
I've never even seen this.

1207
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:13,300
I understand that you probably never even saw that.

1208
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:15,300
Did someone email us this and then we opened it?

1209
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:18,300
I don't know, Mr. Jones. You gave it to me.

1210
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:20,300
What am I supposed to tell you about it? I don't know.

1211
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:22,300
You tell me. That's why I got you.

1212
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:27,300
I did not. I mean, we just go through the email, most of it even unopened, and just send you guys everything.

1213
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:29,300
This isn't an email, is it?

1214
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:32,300
I would imagine. Well, I've never run a background thing on Posner.

1215
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:41,300
All right. Well, one thing we can agree on, because if you look at the bottom of that document, it says FSSTX.085544, correct?

1216
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:42,300
Yeah.

1217
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:44,300
That's the Bates numbers you all use when you give me documents, right?

1218
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:45,300
Mm-hmm.

1219
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:48,300
So this document right here came from Infowars Corporate Files.

1220
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:50,300
I thought you said we haven't given you any documents.

1221
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:52,300
Ooh.

1222
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:53,300
Mr. Jones.

1223
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:56,300
Earlier you said we're defaulted. We gave you nothing. We didn't even respond.

1224
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:59,300
You gave me documents in the Lewis case in response to documents in the end.

1225
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:03,300
Okay. Well, I mean, listen, I'm just telling you, I've never looked at this.

1226
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:05,300
That's not what I'm asking you, Mr. Jones.

1227
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:11,300
But I remember hearing in the news about somebody in Florida doing a background thing on him, and so I figure somebody might have sent us this.

1228
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,300
I'm just guessing. I shouldn't guess. I don't know.

1229
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:15,300
Yeah. Do you think you should be guessing in this deposition?

1230
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:18,300
No, I just said, you're right. I don't know what this is.

1231
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:19,300
So let's not do that anymore.

1232
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:28,300
I think that the attempt there on Alex's part to try and evade with the, I thought we didn't give you any documents, has met with a laugh.

1233
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:32,300
And clearly this isn't going to be a road that Alex is going to be able to go down.

1234
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:38,300
And so instead, he's like, well, I heard there was a guy in Florida. That's obviously a reference to Wolfgang Halbig.

1235
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:39,300
Yeah.

1236
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:41,300
But he didn't want to say his name and evoke it.

1237
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:42,300
I'm going to say his name.

1238
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:45,300
Maybe I'm going to get through this deposition without Halbig coming up.

1239
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:52,300
I bet nobody says Halbig's name. I bet they don't even remember this whole thing. Remember, we got served in 2018. I don't even remember this guy.

1240
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:55,300
Yeah, that's a strange sort of vibe.

1241
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:56,300
Not good.

1242
01:06:56,300 --> 01:07:02,300
So this is a particularly interesting point in this exchange, because Alex seems actually confused by the presentation of this document.

1243
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:08,300
And it's a gigantic and extensive background check on Leonard Posner, one of the parents of the children killed at Sandy Hook.

1244
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:12,300
The fact that Free Speech Systems turned that over in the case is bizarre.

1245
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:17,300
The fact that that was in their files to begin with is bizarre. Like, all of it does not add up.

1246
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:22,300
I suspect, based on Alex's attempts to workshop an explanation, that one of two things is going on here.

1247
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:27,300
Either he knew about this document and is surprised to see it, so he's trying to come up with a cover story.

1248
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:34,300
Or he had no idea about its existence, but he realizes how fucked up it is that that was in their files.

1249
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:36,300
So he's trying to come up with a cover story for that.

1250
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:37,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1251
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:40,300
Either way, the result is an unconvincing mess.

1252
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:47,300
And this question is just left open for a jury to hear without any explanation or exculpatory context on Alex's part.

1253
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:50,300
And I don't think the existence of this document looks good.

1254
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:54,300
No, no, no, no. I mean, I believe that Alex has never read it.

1255
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:55,300
Sure, it's very long.

1256
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:58,300
It's 187 pages, that's fine.

1257
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:11,300
I mean, of all, they were going through the things they want to give, which obviously we know excludes so many things.

1258
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:17,300
And they were looking at the one file in letter positor's name, and they were like,

1259
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:23,300
let's put this super suspicious, massive background report that we totally didn't have ordered or asked for.

1260
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:24,300
With no explanation.

1261
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:25,300
No context.

1262
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:28,300
Everybody seems confused by its existence.

1263
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:29,300
What are you doing here?

1264
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:31,300
Yeah, it's so bizarre.

1265
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:40,300
Especially considering one of the things that's discussed about Alex and Infowars' behavior is the publishing of Posner's address.

1266
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:41,300
Personal details.

1267
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:43,300
Where he got his mail and stuff.

1268
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:52,300
So the existence of this kind of extremely thorough background report is not great.

1269
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:55,300
Yeah, one that has a lot of personal information about it.

1270
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:56,300
You bet.

1271
01:08:56,300 --> 01:09:04,300
You know, if I were somebody who had already had a default judgment against me in one case,

1272
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:11,300
and then specifically releasing a private person's information was at fault in another case,

1273
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:16,300
I would not want to have a big stack of that person's private information.

1274
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:18,300
In your corporate files?

1275
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:19,300
Yeah.

1276
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:22,300
It does seem to, at least it provides opportunity.

1277
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:25,300
You know, like, how would you have information?

1278
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:28,300
Well, here's how you would possibly have that information.

1279
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:30,300
Where did this come from?

1280
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:33,300
Listen, we walk down the streets and shit falls from the sky.

1281
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:34,300
I don't know what to tell you.

1282
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:39,300
It's very strange, and this will be revisited in the Daria deposition, so we will get back to this.

1283
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:43,300
But this is a nice little semantic game Alex tries to play about this.

1284
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:51,300
One thing we can agree on is that in the files of Free Speech Systems is a 187 page investigators comprehensive report on Leonard Posner.

1285
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:52,300
According to you?

1286
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:55,300
No, no, no, no, sir.

1287
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:57,300
According to you, I want your testimony.

1288
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:59,300
I told you I've never seen this before.

1289
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:00,300
I don't care if you've seen it before.

1290
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:01,300
Okay.

1291
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:04,300
I'm saying you put, this is your Bates number on the bottom, correct?

1292
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:05,300
Yes.

1293
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:06,300
Okay.

1294
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:07,300
This came from Infowars corporate files.

1295
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:08,300
Okay.

1296
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:12,300
I think that there is a good dynamic going on where Alex keeps trying to get around things.

1297
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:22,300
And I think that Mark's strategy is flexible enough that he can allow for Alex to say some bullshit and then run into a wall with some of these deflection tactics.

1298
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:23,300
I think it's very good.

1299
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:25,300
I think it's a lot of fun.

1300
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:32,300
Yeah, you really have to establish for a while in advance that no, Alex, you sent this to us.

1301
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:34,300
This is yours, not mine.

1302
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:36,300
I'm not making claims about it.

1303
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:38,300
This is what you sent to us.

1304
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:44,300
And when these sort of linguistic and rhetorical dodges that he uses that are just almost second nature.

1305
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:46,300
Couldn't stop himself if he wanted to.

1306
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:50,300
I would imagine not, but you do have to sort of put a pin in them.

1307
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:54,300
Because you do it enough, it does send the message that I'm not going to put up with this.

1308
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:55,300
No, nip it in the bud.

1309
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:57,300
It's going to be an ineffective and unsuccessful strategy.

1310
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:58,300
Yeah.

1311
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:01,300
And I think that may be how you have to talk to him.

1312
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:03,300
Come down fast and hard, I guess.

1313
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:04,300
A little parental, but.

1314
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:10,300
Well, if he didn't sound like he had failed a book report every time he answered a question,

1315
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:12,300
maybe you wouldn't have to talk to him like a fucking child.

1316
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:13,300
Perhaps.

1317
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:25,300
So they get into talking about the chain of events where Leonard Posner contacted Infowars with a polite complaint,

1318
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:27,300
and then it went from there.

1319
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:33,300
Now, Mr. Posner started in all of this, privately complaining to Infowars.

1320
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:34,300
You agree with that.

1321
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:36,300
He made a private complaint to you.

1322
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:39,300
Yes.

1323
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:40,300
Okay.

1324
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:42,300
And he was very polite about it, wasn't he?

1325
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:47,300
It's been a long time since I saw the email, but I think so.

1326
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:48,300
Okay.

1327
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:52,300
And when that didn't work, he complained again, but this time to YouTube.

1328
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:54,300
You know about that, right?

1329
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:56,300
I really don't remember.

1330
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:59,300
You know Mr. Posner complained to YouTube, right?

1331
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:00,300
No.

1332
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:08,300
I mean, I remember people said he was going around getting a lot of stuff taken down all over the place.

1333
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:12,300
And it made you mad, didn't it?

1334
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:13,300
No.

1335
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:17,300
No, actually I told my crew members, Sandy Hook's a tar baby, stop covering it.

1336
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:18,300
Oh boy.

1337
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,300
Let's keep that one in.

1338
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:21,300
Oh boy.

1339
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:22,300
Okay.

1340
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:26,300
I want that in the legal record for the rest of my life.

1341
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:29,300
I want the legal system to know what I said.

1342
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:30,300
That was a little disappointing.

1343
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:31,300
Yeah.

1344
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:34,300
But the way Alex answered that question is really puzzling to me.

1345
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:36,300
Like, listening to it, I was very confused.

1346
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:41,300
First, he's aware that Mr. Posner politely complained to Infowars and was ignored.

1347
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:45,300
Then, Alex is unaware that Posner went on to complain to YouTube,

1348
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:49,300
but when confronted with how absurd that statement is considering things he said publicly,

1349
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:53,300
Alex tries to explain how he could be mad at Posner about free speech issues,

1350
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:58,300
but somehow not aware that he'd complained to YouTube about Alex and gotten a strike on his channel.

1351
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:04,300
You can basically hear the gears moving here, where Alex is trying to come up with a just plausible enough explanation

1352
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:07,300
for all the details he thinks he has to account for.

1353
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:12,300
Like, oh no, the reason I did those shows was because I heard that he was getting things taken down all over the place

1354
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:13,300
and was against free speech.

1355
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:16,300
Had nothing to do with any personal interaction I had.

1356
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:17,300
No, no, no, no.

1357
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:25,300
My revenue stream being shut down eventually due to the germination of effort from this one particular man,

1358
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:27,300
I wouldn't pay attention to that at all.

1359
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:28,300
Please!

1360
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:31,300
What was I getting from YouTube? Millions?

1361
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:39,300
So, this is just confusing. This answer is bizarre.

1362
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:45,300
Long before you guys ever sued me, I would scream at people if they even talked about it, because it's Tar Baby.

1363
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:53,300
That's why I told you, I just had to compartmentalize it because it's just like constant, I'm the Sandy Hook man, I killed the kids.

1364
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:57,300
I had people in Florida just a few months ago go, you killed those kids! And I went, no I didn't.

1365
01:13:57,300 --> 01:14:01,300
And they just said, whatever. People don't know who Adam Lanzy is, they think I killed the kids, so whatever.

1366
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:07,300
I mean, I just, you know, you guys use a deep platforming, people think I killed the kids, all this stuff.

1367
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:08,300
Just do your worst.

1368
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:09,300
What was my question?

1369
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:11,300
I've answered your question.

1370
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:15,300
You don't know what it was. You were just talking. You were just, right?

1371
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:17,300
No, I didn't know what your question was.

1372
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:21,300
Right, and so you just started talking, because you didn't even know what it was.

1373
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:23,300
Because it wasn't a clear question.

1374
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:25,300
Because you don't care, correct?

1375
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:27,300
Because it wasn't a clear question.

1376
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:31,300
Yeah, you gotta talk to him like a child. You just gotta.

1377
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:35,300
What was the question? What question or do you think you're answering?

1378
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:37,300
Well, you know, I answered your question.

1379
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:39,300
Nope.

1380
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:44,300
No, I did. I did. Yeah, I said words. You said words, I said words. That's how words work.

1381
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:49,300
The question was regarding awareness of the YouTube complaint that Posner had made.

1382
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:51,300
Didn't you see? He answered that question.

1383
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:53,300
I went to Florida and someone said I killed the kids.

1384
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:57,300
Yes, he answered the question. People don't even know who Adam Lanza is. I killed the kids.

1385
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:01,300
Just do your worst to me. That's the answer to that question, Dan.

1386
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:10,300
So, this transitions from some questions about Mr. Posner to being questions about another parent,

1387
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:17,300
Neil Hesselen, who was featured in the Megan Kelly piece that Alex got so mad about.

1388
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:21,300
And we get a good establishing question here.

1389
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:26,300
When Neil Hesselen, okay, first of all, you know who Neil Hesselen is, right?

1390
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:27,300
Yes.

1391
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:31,300
Okay. So, when Neil Hesselen appeared on Megan Kelly's show in 2017, do you remember that?

1392
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:32,300
Yes.

1393
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:43,300
Okay. When he went on there and said he was upset by the things you were saying about Sandy Hook, did you believe him?

1394
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:49,300
I thought it was all done very theatrically in a very canned way, but I do think parents had pain in their children.

1395
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:54,300
But it was all done. It had an infomercial feel to it. And that's my view of it.

1396
01:15:54,300 --> 01:16:01,300
Look, I don't care really what you think about Megan Kelly or NBC News run by the largest weapons manufacturer in the world.

1397
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:06,300
You know, like, I don't care. Yes, they make incredibly edited videos.

1398
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:14,300
They – it's a complete – I mean, if you – I'm sure if you've ever seen an NBC production, lights and cameras and staging that, they set up scenes.

1399
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:18,300
They do all this stuff. I know that. I know it looks like a video. I'm not asking about NBC or Megan Kelly.

1400
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:22,300
I just want to know about Neil Hesselen. Did you believe him?

1401
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:25,300
Objection form.

1402
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:30,300
Believe him about what?

1403
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:34,300
When he said he was upset about the things you said about Sandy Hook, did you believe him?

1404
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:35,300
Yes, I believe him.

1405
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:42,300
So this is, I think, a really good approach that Mark is taking with the questioning, where he's getting out in front of Alex's criticism of the media.

1406
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:50,300
This is one of the ways that Alex can best deflect from taking responsibility for his actions is to point to other media entities and yell about the mistakes they've made or how they're corrupt.

1407
01:16:50,300 --> 01:17:01,300
By introducing that on his own, Mark is essentially taking that tool away or at least weakening its impact because if Alex tries to employ that dodge, the response he can clearly expect isn't a distracting argument,

1408
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:06,300
but something like, we're in agreement that the media isn't great, but that's not relevant to the discussion we're having.

1409
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:08,300
Yeah, he just cut off Alex's feet.

1410
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:15,300
Essentially, yeah. This is something that I think is a really good tactic you can use when you're talking to hyper-evasive people who are also full of shit.

1411
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:24,300
If there's something that's a standard rhetorical refuge that they tend to take, staking out your own claim in that space makes it so they're less comfortable retreating to it.

1412
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:34,300
And that's a good ploy. And at the same time, you've re-centered this to being like, did you believe Neil Heslin when he said this about his kid?

1413
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:37,300
Because that is kind of relevant.

1414
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:48,300
I want to take you back to the night that you first saw that Megyn Kelly interview, which probably was a surprise for you considering that it was not what she represented it to you to be, correct?

1415
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:49,300
Yes.

1416
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:58,300
Okay. And on that night when you saw that video and you saw Mr. Heslin saying those things, I want to take you back to that date, okay?

1417
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:11,300
And at that date, you understood that if InfoWorst were to make a video saying Mr. Heslin could not have held his son, that would be very upsetting to Mr. Heslin. You understood that.

1418
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:13,300
Protection form.

1419
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:15,300
No, I did not understand that.

1420
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:16,300
Okay.

1421
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:29,300
This is bizarre. Because he has said already that he understood and believed Neil Heslin on Megyn Kelly's show that he was upset by the things that InfoWorst has said.

1422
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:31,300
He said apparent has to be a fe pain.

1423
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:36,300
Sure. But somehow now he's saying that he doesn't understand that saying more stuff.

1424
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:38,300
What are human emotions?

1425
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:41,300
Yeah, that's like an inherent contradiction that he's making.

1426
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:42,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1427
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:44,300
And that is kind of bizarre.

1428
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:50,300
Alex, excuse me. Do you understand basic human empathy? Just on a...

1429
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:51,300
A little.

1430
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:52,300
Okay. Well.

1431
01:18:52,300 --> 01:19:01,300
So after the Megyn Kelly piece, Owen Schroyer did a story where he said that Neil Heslin couldn't have held his son.

1432
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:02,300
Right. Yes, I recall.

1433
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:11,300
Which is part of the lawsuit. And so, you know, we want to know why did he do that? Who gave him the idea to do that?

1434
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:25,300
How do you feel about it now? Do you know sitting here today who made the choice for Owen Schroyer to put those claims by Jim Fetzer on the air about Neil Heslin after the Megyn Kelly interview? Do you know who did that?

1435
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:33,300
It was a live show. See, it's not a video we made. It was a live show. And I believe he read a Zero Hedge article. He just read an article.

1436
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:38,300
About Jim Fetzer stuff, right? Remember that?

1437
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:40,300
I believe he was in the article.

1438
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:50,300
Right. And you understand that a video was made for that and uploaded to YouTube on June 26, 2017? Would you have any reason to dispute that?

1439
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:53,300
I'm not sure we even had our YouTube channel then.

1440
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:57,300
But you did. You did. You lost it.

1441
01:19:57,300 --> 01:20:11,300
You also know that a month after Mr. Schroyer made that video, you then took that five-minute video from the live show and played it on your show again. You understand that? You're being sued for that.

1442
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:13,300
Yes, I guess.

1443
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:23,300
Okay. So whose decision was it, if you know, for him to basically give more air to Mr. Fetzer's claims? Whose decision was that?

1444
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:24,300
It was Owen's decision.

1445
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:25,300
Okay.

1446
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:30,300
Ooh. Hey, Owen, meet my friend Buss over here. You're going to go under it.

1447
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:31,300
Oh boy.

1448
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:34,300
Yeah, that was all Owen.

1449
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:35,300
Yeah.

1450
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:39,300
Now, that still doesn't excuse Alex's re-airing of the video on his show.

1451
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:48,300
Nope. That was your choice, based on what Alex has just said, which is that Owen obviously has control over his own show.

1452
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:49,300
Sure.

1453
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:51,300
It's a live show. He chose to do that.

1454
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:55,300
That means that Alex, having the same control over his show-

1455
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:56,300
Probably more.

1456
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:57,300
You would assume-

1457
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:58,300
Yeah.

1458
01:20:58,300 --> 01:21:01,300
Chose to air the exact same information on his show.

1459
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:04,300
Ah, look, I don't have time for those kinds of little decisions.

1460
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:07,300
Okay, that's a good point. But wait, is it?

1461
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:17,300
So there's a rebuttal to this and a follow-up question that Mark may have some information that runs counter to this thing that Alex is saying.

1462
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:18,300
Uh-oh.

1463
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:27,300
The thing is, I talked to him a couple days ago and he said, no, he didn't read it at all or research it. Somebody put it in front of him and told him to do it.

1464
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:33,300
He doesn't remember who, but he doesn't do that. I mean, he doesn't research stuff himself. Somebody puts it in front of him.

1465
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:37,300
So let's try to go at it this way. If Owen's going to be doing that video that day-

1466
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:38,300
I don't agree with that statement.

1467
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:42,300
Okay. Well, I mean, again, talk to Owen because he testified a couple days ago, right?

1468
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:47,300
So this question Mark poses brings up a point that puts Alex in a really uncomfortable position.

1469
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:55,300
He needs the impression to be that InfoWars reporters are all in-depth researchers who bring their own work to the show and deliver hard news.

1470
01:21:55,300 --> 01:22:00,300
This is an important image for Alex to maintain since it looks like what journalists do, kind of.

1471
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:06,300
The problem, however, is that Owen has told Mark that when he said that Neil Hesseland couldn't have held his son after the shooting,

1472
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:12,300
that he was just reading an article someone put in front of him with no awareness of what the article was or what the sources were.

1473
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:16,300
So Alex is now in the position of having to claim that Owen lied.

1474
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:22,300
This is likely because the alternative opens a can of worms that Alex does not want to have opened to the public,

1475
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:26,300
and that's asking the question, who put the article in front of Owen?

1476
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:33,300
If Owen isn't lying, then someone in that studio has a shocking level of editorial control over what goes on on the show,

1477
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:35,300
and we have no idea who that person might be.

1478
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:40,300
You can see how this question alone could lead to some discomfort because if such a person exists,

1479
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:43,300
you have to ask yourself, how did they get this editorial authority?

1480
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:50,300
Is that part of their job description, and what kind of digging do they do into the sources that they're providing for the anchors to just say on air?

1481
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:57,300
On the flip side of this, it also opens up a question about who can and can't just tell Owen what to say on air.

1482
01:22:57,300 --> 01:23:02,300
If a person who fed him the story was someone like a boom mic operator, then that raises the question,

1483
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:06,300
can anyone just put something in front of Owen and he'll read it on air as the news?

1484
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:07,300
Yeah.

1485
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:08,300
That's troubling.

1486
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:11,300
Yeah, we're into anchorman Ron Burgundy territory.

1487
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:16,300
Yeah, so Alex is in the position now where one option he has is throwing Owen under the bus.

1488
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:22,300
The other option involves the possibility of some undisclosed editorial manager giving Owen the story to report,

1489
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:30,300
or the possibility of complete negligence and lack of oversight about everything they put on the air to the point where any person who's there can just-

1490
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:33,300
Oh my god, I just heard a bus' brake screech so loud.

1491
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:38,300
I just- I had to stop for some reason. I don't know what could have-

1492
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:42,300
It's strange. I understand the instinct that Alex has.

1493
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:43,300
Yeah.

1494
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:49,300
But yeah, this point that Mark brings up of a conversation he's had with Owen-

1495
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:50,300
Right.

1496
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:59,300
It's very counter. To give the bus metaphor, it's two buses heading for an intersection.

1497
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:02,300
Both trying to push one another under it.

1498
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:04,300
And both are being driven by Keanu Reeves and speed.

1499
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:05,300
Right.

1500
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:17,300
What I find interesting about this so far, and really what is going to do Alex in more than anything else,

1501
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:26,300
is that Alex's ability to understand questions is so shallow that he doesn't realize that by answering one of Mark's questions,

1502
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:30,300
he is then raising the possibility that more questions will be asked.

1503
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:34,300
Like, he doesn't get that. He believes that the answer is the end of the question.

1504
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:36,300
But I think that's probably because he's used to monologuing.

1505
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:37,300
That's what I'm saying.

1506
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:42,300
And then also having interviews with guests on his show who are essentially conspirators.

1507
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:43,300
Right.

1508
01:24:43,300 --> 01:24:44,300
Or co-collaborators with him.

1509
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:52,300
Right. So this is a completely new concept to him that the answer is also a consequence that leads to more questions.

1510
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:54,300
John Rappaport would never ask a follow-up.

1511
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:57,300
Exactly. This is fucking with his brain.

1512
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:59,300
Why can't I have a deposition with John Rappaport?

1513
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:04,300
Wait, wait, wait. I answered one question. Why are you asking more questions about that question?

1514
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:07,300
When I have conversations with Steve Pachenick, he usually tells me I'm a genius.

1515
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:09,300
He says I look pretty in the mornings.

1516
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:15,300
So Alex has to really put his foot down and make clear that, like, no, Owen runs his own show.

1517
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:16,300
Oh, boy.

1518
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:17,300
He is in charge.

1519
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:18,300
Here we go.

1520
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:28,300
So the only two people in the room who are probably going to have any influence on what goes in front of the anchor to say are the producer and the person who's researching, checking clips, and that sort of thing.

1521
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:29,300
Right?

1522
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:37,300
No, no. The way it works is the host is telling people what to play and what articles, and the hosts run the shows.

1523
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:43,300
So Owen should have been the one who found the Zero Hedge article? That's what you're thinking? That's how it would normally work? He would have found that article?

1524
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:51,300
Hundreds. Hundreds of articles. This is the way I do it. Other people don't do it this way.

1525
01:25:51,300 --> 01:26:03,300
I have my own, basically, producer, booker, everything. So the way I sit there and I print hundreds of articles, or I direct people to, and I just say go to these ten sites and print everything on it.

1526
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:12,300
So I'll give a physical copy. And then other people there have chosen to do it the same way, and then just constantly more information is coming out as the day goes on.

1527
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:21,300
It's kind of like a parrot's eating. It might throw away 90% of the stuff that's put in front of it, and then it sits there and decides what it wants to eat.

1528
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:35,300
But the radio host run the show. It's a radio show on TV. It's a radio show. It's not journalism. It's not in the main. It's just like Howard Stern, or it's just like Rush Limbaugh.

1529
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:39,300
And you're playing clips, you're covering articles, you're giving your opinion on things.

1530
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:41,300
Oh, so it's not journalism?

1531
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:43,300
Not even a little bit.

1532
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:45,300
Okay. I agree.

1533
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:50,300
It's a radio show on TV. Ironically, it is neither of those things.

1534
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:55,300
Sure. It's just a thing where we riff around about extremist topics.

1535
01:26:55,300 --> 01:27:10,300
So, Mark wants to establish that this information that Alex was using in the 2017 videos that he put out, it traces back to people like Jim Fetzer.

1536
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:17,300
And whether or not, at that time, he had reason to believe that Jim Fetzer was not a good source.

1537
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:30,300
Back in 2017, you had information, you had seen information that caused you to doubt whether Mr. Hessen really held his kid.

1538
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:32,300
Correct?

1539
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:34,300
Yes, I did see an article questioning it.

1540
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:42,300
Yeah, and that information was raised by Mr. Fetzer, correct?

1541
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:46,300
I don't have the article in front of me.

1542
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:59,300
Okay. In 2017, Infowars, the company itself, had an understanding that there was issues with Mr. Fetzer's credibility. Correct?

1543
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:06,300
Objection form.

1544
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:08,300
I mean, I can't really speak to Mr. Fetzer's credibility.

1545
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:10,300
So this is a trap.

1546
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:12,300
I can.

1547
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:22,300
This is obviously the question being asked. The answer is in the question of the stuff you said was traced back to Jim Fetzer.

1548
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:25,300
The article was just Jim Fetzer information.

1549
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:32,300
So the second question is also more or less a statement that, like, hey, do you have any reasons to doubt his credibility?

1550
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:33,300
Yeah.

1551
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:35,300
And, of course, there's an email.

1552
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:37,300
I mean, I can't really speak to Mr. Fetzer's credibility.

1553
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:43,300
Okay. Well, other people in your company have spoken to Mr. Fetzer's credibility to you. Correct?

1554
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:45,300
Well...

1555
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:46,300
I don't recall.

1556
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:50,300
You don't recall Paul Watson talking to you about Jim Fetzer?

1557
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:51,300
No.

1558
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:54,300
Okay.

1559
01:28:54,300 --> 01:29:04,300
If somebody, if Paul Watson in 2015, is he your chief reporter by then? Is he an editor? What is he? Do you remember?

1560
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:09,300
Yeah, he was the head editor of Infowars, the articles, the site itself.

1561
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:12,300
Okay. And he also did some hosting duties, too, right?

1562
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:13,300
Yes.

1563
01:29:13,300 --> 01:29:15,300
Okay.

1564
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:22,300
If Mr. Watson, let's just say again that Mr. Watson, somebody whose opinion you respect, I would assume, correct?

1565
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:23,300
Yes.

1566
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:27,300
Somebody you will, if he brings you something, you'll listen to it, right?

1567
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:28,300
Yes.

1568
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:30,300
You may not always agree with Mr. Watson, right?

1569
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:31,300
Yes.

1570
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:32,300
But you'll listen to him.

1571
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:33,300
Yes.

1572
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:48,300
Okay. If Mr. Watson had come to you in 2015 and told you, Alex, Jim Fetzer's bat shit crazy, would you have listened to him? Would you have taken that into consideration?

1573
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:49,300
Yes.

1574
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:50,300
Wow.

1575
01:29:50,300 --> 01:30:01,300
This is, I think this could not be more like a fork in chess. You know, like when you've got your knight in the right spot and you're, listen, I'm getting your queen or I'm getting your rook.

1576
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:06,300
So how do you want this to go? And Alex does not understand what's about to happen to him.

1577
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:11,300
Yeah, it's like there's the email of Paul saying, we can't trust these fucking people.

1578
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:12,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No.

1579
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:17,300
And it's like, it's an email that Buckley is on talking about like, oh no, we have to talk to Alex.

1580
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:25,300
I can't believe Alex is hearing this and not realizing that what's about to happen is exactly the thing that, I mean, this is amazing.

1581
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:27,300
Well, the water's getting hot.

1582
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:30,300
I want the hammer to drop, my friend. This frog is boiling.

1583
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:41,300
If you had received information that called into doubt Mr. Fetzer's credibility, you would check in and verify that before ever relying on him again, correct?

1584
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:44,300
I can't talk about the hypotheticals that you're discussing.

1585
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:51,300
I already told you that 98% of what we do is cover news in the public domain and give our opinion and commentary.

1586
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:59,300
And so I'm not a journalist at the Wall Street Journal that writes one year long investigative, you know, journalist reports.

1587
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:03,300
And so I'm a radio talk show host that puts the show on TV.

1588
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:07,300
This whole thing that he's doing with like, I'm just a talk show host kind of thing.

1589
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:11,300
It just, it feels like a, uh, you wouldn't hit a guy with glasses.

1590
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:13,300
Hey, come on, come on.

1591
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:14,300
I'm just a talk show host.

1592
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:18,300
Oh my, I'm just a little talk show host over here. I'm not causing no problems.

1593
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:26,300
It's such nonsense. I mean, like, he's like also trying to present this idea of like everything we cover is just like mainstream media stuff.

1594
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:30,300
Like he pretends that he has high level secret sources.

1595
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:35,300
He constantly is taking primary source documents and coming up with fantasy interpretations of them.

1596
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:39,300
He's regularly conducting the most softball interviews with dangerous lunatics.

1597
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:48,300
And a lot of the time he's even reporting stuff based on fake stories from his past or esoteric dreams that he came up with that he had that he thinks are prophetic.

1598
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:52,300
But we can't blame him for that until we know he's not a psychic, okay?

1599
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:54,300
And we can't prove that yet, so.

1600
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:59,300
Um, I'm going to go ahead and err on the side of where I'm at.

1601
01:31:59,300 --> 01:32:00,300
Okay, fine.

1602
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:05,300
So the hammer doesn't necessarily come down about this email from Paul, but we know that it exists.

1603
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:06,300
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1604
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:07,300
And so you don't really need to bring it up.

1605
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:08,300
No.

1606
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:10,300
Because you have Alex already saying these things.

1607
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:11,300
Saying, yeah.

1608
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:17,300
And so instead let's talk a little bit about old grump David Knight.

1609
01:32:17,300 --> 01:32:18,300
Hey!

1610
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:20,300
Who's David Knight?

1611
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:25,300
David Knight is a talk show host.

1612
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:26,300
Does he work for you right now?

1613
01:32:26,300 --> 01:32:27,300
No.

1614
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:28,300
Okay.

1615
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:29,300
He did work for you recently?

1616
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:30,300
Yes.

1617
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:32,300
When did he leave the company?

1618
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:34,300
I remember correctly about a year ago.

1619
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:36,300
And then he's not come back in any way?

1620
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:38,300
Are you all still doing videos with David Knight?

1621
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:39,300
No.

1622
01:32:39,300 --> 01:32:40,300
Okay.

1623
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:49,300
Um, David Knight did not, there was some, I don't know why I said this.

1624
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:53,300
There was some tension between David Knight and Dr. Steve Pacinek.

1625
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:56,300
Do you agree with that?

1626
01:32:56,300 --> 01:33:03,300
Um, I mean, I remember some.

1627
01:33:03,300 --> 01:33:09,300
David Knight and Steve Pacinek did not get along, right?

1628
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:11,300
I guess.

1629
01:33:11,300 --> 01:33:17,300
David Knight was incredibly critical of the thing Steve Pacinek was saying about Sandy Hook, correct?

1630
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:18,300
No, I don't remember that.

1631
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:20,300
Okay.

1632
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:24,300
Can you tell me why David Knight isn't with the company anymore?

1633
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:29,300
David was saying that he was being censored and no one was censoring him and he was just unhappy.

1634
01:33:29,300 --> 01:33:34,300
Um, and so I fired him.

1635
01:33:34,300 --> 01:33:36,300
Alright. Interesting.

1636
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:42,300
So I've made some comments about tactics and strategies Mark's using that I think are positive.

1637
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:43,300
Right.

1638
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:49,300
In the interest of total fairness, I do have to clarify that Mark has a slightly incorrect piece of information that he's putting out here.

1639
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:57,300
David Knight was totally into what Steve was saying about Sandy Hook and actually was still promoting that Sandy Hook was fake on his show until at least 2017.

1640
01:33:57,300 --> 01:34:09,300
David got sick of Steve when he said that the Las Vegas shooting was fake and that led to the deterioration of their working relationship and then David got really mad when Steve started coming back on the show around the lead up to the 2020 election.

1641
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:17,300
David was insistent that Steve was a con man and the stuff about all the ballots being watermarked with blockchain was stupid and that Steve was just lying to Alex.

1642
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:18,300
Yeah.

1643
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:21,300
This is what led to him getting fired and replaced by Harrison Smith hosting the American Journal.

1644
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:22,300
Right.

1645
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:29,300
So there's a definite truth to the tension between the two of them, but David Knight actually was totally fine with the Sandy Hook stuff.

1646
01:34:29,300 --> 01:34:30,300
Right, right, right.

1647
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:31,300
Which is, yes.

1648
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:34,300
This is only more damning for David Knight.

1649
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:35,300
Sure.

1650
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:37,300
And Alex is like, ah, he's being censored.

1651
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:39,300
It's like, is he being censored about Steve?

1652
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:40,300
Yeah.

1653
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:41,300
You were censoring him.

1654
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:42,300
Yes.

1655
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:46,300
He wanted to go and say that Steve Pacenik was a lying piece of shit and you were like, no.

1656
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:48,300
So I fired him.

1657
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:49,300
Yeah.

1658
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:56,300
So now we learn a little bit about some of David Knight's actions back in the Sandy Hook time.

1659
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:57,300
This is weird.

1660
01:34:57,300 --> 01:34:58,300
Let's hear about it.

1661
01:34:58,300 --> 01:35:01,300
I'm going to put in front of you what I marked as exhibit seven.

1662
01:35:01,300 --> 01:35:07,300
Now, one of the things you'll notice about this document is you look down in the bottom corners, there's no numbers, are there?

1663
01:35:07,300 --> 01:35:08,300
Bottom corners of the document.

1664
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:09,300
No.

1665
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:10,300
Blank page.

1666
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:11,300
All right.

1667
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:16,300
So this is, I'm going to represent to you, this is a document that was produced to me by your former lawyers that has no base number on it.

1668
01:35:16,300 --> 01:35:17,300
Okay.

1669
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:25,300
I don't have an identification number for you, but looking at this email with David Knight's name to and from, that's one of your employees at that time?

1670
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:26,300
2017?

1671
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:27,300
Yes.

1672
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:28,300
Okay.

1673
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:29,300
And I'm going to go ahead and read this for you here.

1674
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:33,300
This is the date is June 19th, 2017?

1675
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:34,300
Mm-hmm.

1676
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:37,300
Okay.

1677
01:35:37,300 --> 01:35:41,300
You remember that the Megyn Kelly interview was in the summer of 2017, right?

1678
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:42,300
Yes.

1679
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:43,300
Okay.

1680
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:49,300
And one of the videos that your company is being sued for is a June 26th video from 2017 that Owen Schroyer did.

1681
01:35:49,300 --> 01:35:51,300
We've just been talking about, right?

1682
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:52,300
Yes.

1683
01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:56,300
And then in July, you also did a video about Mr. Houston as well, correct?

1684
01:35:56,300 --> 01:35:58,300
That you're being sued for?

1685
01:35:58,300 --> 01:35:59,300
I don't, yes.

1686
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:03,300
So you do know you did make that July 20th video about Mr. Houston.

1687
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:05,300
You know that sitting here today.

1688
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:08,300
You mean I did a live radio show, yes?

1689
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:09,300
Did a show.

1690
01:36:09,300 --> 01:36:10,300
Did a show, right?

1691
01:36:10,300 --> 01:36:11,300
I didn't make a video.

1692
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:15,300
Well, I guess you didn't make the video, but somebody did.

1693
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:18,300
Somebody made a video of that and uploaded it to the YouTube channel.

1694
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:19,300
Okay.

1695
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:23,300
So I don't, what I'm trying to get, because you've brought this distinction up a couple

1696
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:25,300
of times, that no, we're just a live radio show.

1697
01:36:25,300 --> 01:36:27,300
It's not a video.

1698
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:31,300
But there are videos and they are uploaded to YouTube, correct?

1699
01:36:31,300 --> 01:36:32,300
They were, yes.

1700
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:36,300
And in fact, the listenership for the radio show could be totally different than who's

1701
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:38,300
watching the YouTube video, correct?

1702
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:39,300
They are, yeah.

1703
01:36:39,300 --> 01:36:40,300
Yeah, okay.

1704
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:45,300
So now we have this video, we have this email from David Knight and it's from David Knight

1705
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:48,300
to David Knight, right?

1706
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:51,300
So he's sending himself something, correct?

1707
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:52,300
I would guess.

1708
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:53,300
Okay.

1709
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:59,300
The subject line is it says Connecticut Carry releases the troubled past of Neil Heslin.

1710
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:05,300
And then do you see that there is a link there from AmoLand.com, correct?

1711
01:37:05,300 --> 01:37:06,300
Yes.

1712
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:07,300
Okay.

1713
01:37:07,300 --> 01:37:10,300
And then it says sent for my iPad, right?

1714
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:11,300
Yes.

1715
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:12,300
Okay.

1716
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:16,300
And then this email here was sent to himself at 6.12 PM.

1717
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:17,300
You see that?

1718
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:18,300
Yes.

1719
01:37:18,300 --> 01:37:19,300
Okay.

1720
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:20,300
Everything I've said about this email is accurate?

1721
01:37:20,300 --> 01:37:21,300
Yes.

1722
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:23,940
Do you have any reason to think that this is not a true and accurate email from Infowars

1723
01:37:23,940 --> 01:37:24,940
as far?

1724
01:37:24,940 --> 01:37:26,360
I don't know.

1725
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:27,360
I don't know either.

1726
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:30,300
You gave it to me and it doesn't even, that's why I'm asking you.

1727
01:37:30,300 --> 01:37:32,300
Do you have any reason to dispute this as a real email?

1728
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:33,300
No, I don't have any reason to dispute it.

1729
01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:34,300
Okay.

1730
01:37:34,300 --> 01:37:39,220
So we've got this established that David Knight around the time of the Sandy or the Megan

1731
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:46,020
Kelly interview at 6 PM was emailing himself an article with dirt on Neil Heslin.

1732
01:37:46,020 --> 01:37:47,020
Right.

1733
01:37:47,020 --> 01:37:48,020
Now.

1734
01:37:48,020 --> 01:37:50,620
When did the interview air?

1735
01:37:50,620 --> 01:37:51,620
But there's more.

1736
01:37:51,620 --> 01:37:52,620
Hold on.

1737
01:37:52,620 --> 01:37:53,620
Okay.

1738
01:37:53,620 --> 01:37:54,620
Let me show you this too.

1739
01:37:54,620 --> 01:37:57,580
It's a similar email, which I've marked as exhibit eight.

1740
01:37:57,580 --> 01:38:00,300
You see this is 6-18-2017?

1741
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:01,780
Yes.

1742
01:38:01,780 --> 01:38:03,140
Okay.

1743
01:38:03,140 --> 01:38:08,380
Um, just a couple of days before Owen Troyer did his video, correct?

1744
01:38:08,380 --> 01:38:09,380
Yes.

1745
01:38:09,380 --> 01:38:10,380
Okay.

1746
01:38:10,380 --> 01:38:18,180
And do you remember that Megan Kelly's interview with your profile came out in June 19th, 2017?

1747
01:38:18,180 --> 01:38:19,180
I don't know.

1748
01:38:19,180 --> 01:38:20,180
I don't remember the date.

1749
01:38:20,180 --> 01:38:21,180
Okay.

1750
01:38:21,180 --> 01:38:25,820
Um, so here we have again, David Knight sending an email to himself, David Knight, seek the

1751
01:38:25,820 --> 01:38:27,200
truth 80 at Yahoo.

1752
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:29,180
Is that another one of David Knight's email address?

1753
01:38:29,180 --> 01:38:30,180
I don't know.

1754
01:38:30,180 --> 01:38:31,180
Okay.

1755
01:38:31,180 --> 01:38:32,180
You don't know who that is?

1756
01:38:32,180 --> 01:38:33,180
Okay.

1757
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:38,500
Uh, it says subject Neil Heslin, father of Sandy hook victim faces, criminal charges

1758
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:40,220
news country times.com.

1759
01:38:40,220 --> 01:38:41,220
Right.

1760
01:38:41,220 --> 01:38:42,220
Yes.

1761
01:38:42,220 --> 01:38:43,620
And then there's a country times article link.

1762
01:38:43,620 --> 01:38:44,620
Yes.

1763
01:38:44,620 --> 01:38:45,620
Okay.

1764
01:38:45,620 --> 01:38:46,620
And then mr.

1765
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:50,260
Knight sent himself to the, sent himself this email at two 56 in the morning.

1766
01:38:50,260 --> 01:38:51,260
Um, yes.

1767
01:38:51,260 --> 01:38:52,260
Okay.

1768
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:55,940
You have any reason to think that this isn't a correct, true and copy email that came out

1769
01:38:55,940 --> 01:38:56,940
of info worst files?

1770
01:38:56,940 --> 01:38:57,940
No, I'm not.

1771
01:38:57,940 --> 01:38:58,940
Okay.

1772
01:38:58,940 --> 01:39:01,820
I think this is a good strategy that's being employed here because there's no question

1773
01:39:01,820 --> 01:39:05,900
for Alex to answer other than just like, do you have reason to believe this is inauthentic?

1774
01:39:05,900 --> 01:39:06,900
Right.

1775
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:10,780
It's essentially gives Alex no room to move or to spin anything.

1776
01:39:10,780 --> 01:39:15,980
There's almost definitely no information that Alex could give about these emails that would

1777
01:39:15,980 --> 01:39:18,720
be useful, but letting them just sit there.

1778
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:22,880
There's clear indications that senior employees at info wars were doing research into things

1779
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:29,740
that they could use to smear Heslin at two AM or two 50 something AM and 6 PM that day.

1780
01:39:29,740 --> 01:39:35,100
Like there's a stretch of time where he had, uh, it's almost like it was his job for the

1781
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:36,100
day.

1782
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:40,900
It's such a bad look almost as if somebody had directed him to find information on Neil

1783
01:39:40,900 --> 01:39:45,180
Heslin and he had been up all night and he had been working so hard on it.

1784
01:39:45,180 --> 01:39:51,140
And then later, uh, people use that information, burning the midnight oil looking for smear.

1785
01:39:51,140 --> 01:39:54,780
I think it was probably just cause he was, you know, he was just doing it on his own.

1786
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:59,700
It gives an indication of the kind of vibe maybe that was going on around info wars.

1787
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:01,260
Hey, I want this information.

1788
01:40:01,260 --> 01:40:07,060
So, um, because there's, I don't know, maybe the appearance of like looking for ways to

1789
01:40:07,060 --> 01:40:11,660
attack this person who was in the Macon Kelly interview seemed like maybe threatening to

1790
01:40:11,660 --> 01:40:12,660
Alex.

1791
01:40:12,660 --> 01:40:13,660
Come on.

1792
01:40:13,660 --> 01:40:18,100
Um, this is an important question, which is like, do you have any reason to believe that

1793
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:20,700
these people were faking their grief?

1794
01:40:20,700 --> 01:40:22,380
Does the company have any reason to contend?

1795
01:40:22,380 --> 01:40:24,100
Well, first let me ask you it this way.

1796
01:40:24,100 --> 01:40:29,300
Do you have any reason to contend that any of these parents have been faking their distress

1797
01:40:29,300 --> 01:40:35,000
over info wars actions as it regards to any hope?

1798
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:42,260
I did not kill their children and I didn't visit Adam Lanza's house, the CIA did and

1799
01:40:42,260 --> 01:40:43,340
all the rest of that.

1800
01:40:43,340 --> 01:40:47,220
And no one sued me back at the time when I was actually talking about it was once I became

1801
01:40:47,220 --> 01:40:51,660
extremely famous and Hillary Clinton made an issue about it in campaign ads and then

1802
01:40:51,660 --> 01:40:53,400
Trump won the election.

1803
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:57,460
And then I became this big supercharged political target as low hanging fruit.

1804
01:40:57,460 --> 01:41:00,600
And then, and then, and then they got, Oh, he's the Sandy Hook man.

1805
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:05,740
And then, and then the, the, the, the, the, the, the anti gun control groups, the democratic

1806
01:41:05,740 --> 01:41:10,780
party basically attached themselves to me so that every time I was in the news, they

1807
01:41:10,780 --> 01:41:15,260
could then bring back up Sandy hook for the, for the gun control advocacy that they have.

1808
01:41:15,260 --> 01:41:18,880
And that's what this long process has, has, has, has been okay.

1809
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:20,920
First of all, objection nonresponsive.

1810
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:25,500
Was any of that, was any of that meant to be a reason that you contend that the Sandy

1811
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:28,860
hook families are faking, or the same, my clients are faking their distress.

1812
01:41:28,860 --> 01:41:31,460
I do not think they're faking their distress.

1813
01:41:31,460 --> 01:41:32,460
Okay.

1814
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:34,900
So their distress over what you said is genuine.

1815
01:41:34,900 --> 01:41:36,220
You admit that objection.

1816
01:41:36,220 --> 01:41:39,140
I mean, I would call it more hatred than, than, than distress.

1817
01:41:39,140 --> 01:41:41,780
I think that, yeah, I think, I think there's some feelings of hatred.

1818
01:41:41,780 --> 01:41:42,780
I do.

1819
01:41:42,780 --> 01:41:47,460
I think, I think when, for instance, you can understand how when Neil has spent the last

1820
01:41:47,460 --> 01:41:52,620
moments with his little heroic child who saved some lives that day, looking him in the face

1821
01:41:52,620 --> 01:41:53,620
with a bullet hole in his head.

1822
01:41:53,620 --> 01:41:54,620
I didn't kill him.

1823
01:41:54,620 --> 01:41:55,620
I know you didn't kill him.

1824
01:41:55,620 --> 01:41:56,620
Please.

1825
01:41:56,620 --> 01:41:57,620
Let him just ask you.

1826
01:41:57,620 --> 01:41:58,620
Yeah.

1827
01:41:58,620 --> 01:41:59,620
Let's not interrupt me.

1828
01:41:59,620 --> 01:42:00,620
Mr. Jones.

1829
01:42:00,620 --> 01:42:01,620
I know you got my client.

1830
01:42:01,620 --> 01:42:02,620
I'm I'm handling it with my client.

1831
01:42:02,620 --> 01:42:08,940
You're not, I'm asking you, Mr. Jones, I'm not saying you killed these kids.

1832
01:42:08,940 --> 01:42:10,620
Nobody's saying that you caused that grief.

1833
01:42:10,620 --> 01:42:12,360
Let's make that really clear.

1834
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:16,580
Nobody's saying that these parents though were grieving over the deaths of their children.

1835
01:42:16,580 --> 01:42:18,980
That's a thing that they went through has nothing to do with you.

1836
01:42:18,980 --> 01:42:23,040
You get that their grief over the death of their children has nothing to do with you.

1837
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:24,040
You get that.

1838
01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:27,380
But then that through the gun control that it was projected on gun owners, blaming us

1839
01:42:27,380 --> 01:42:28,380
for their deaths.

1840
01:42:28,380 --> 01:42:30,040
And we don't accept that.

1841
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:34,140
I don't even know what that means, but gun owners have all been blamed.

1842
01:42:34,140 --> 01:42:35,540
You asked me to answer your question.

1843
01:42:35,540 --> 01:42:39,700
We get blamed every time some crazy person on Prozac goes and kills people at the CIA

1844
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:41,020
went and visited on record.

1845
01:42:41,020 --> 01:42:44,620
And then, and then we get blamed and we're tired of being blamed.

1846
01:42:44,620 --> 01:42:48,380
You can almost hear Alex starting to turn into like show mode here.

1847
01:42:48,380 --> 01:42:49,380
Yep.

1848
01:42:49,380 --> 01:42:52,980
You could almost hear that flip gets with the switch, get flipped.

1849
01:42:52,980 --> 01:42:56,100
Because there was just like, I guess I'm going to yell now, or I guess I'm going to get really

1850
01:42:56,100 --> 01:42:57,980
combative and do a performance.

1851
01:42:57,980 --> 01:43:03,940
Well, it was in reaction to him being forced to say, yes, I, that is, you know, once he

1852
01:43:03,940 --> 01:43:09,820
got that negative, the, that, that terrible head space of just having to say, yes, I know

1853
01:43:09,820 --> 01:43:10,980
what you're saying.

1854
01:43:10,980 --> 01:43:13,100
He couldn't deflect on anything.

1855
01:43:13,100 --> 01:43:17,180
So then it just turned into him being like, there's only one way for me to take control

1856
01:43:17,180 --> 01:43:18,180
of this again.

1857
01:43:18,180 --> 01:43:19,460
And that's to do my show.

1858
01:43:19,460 --> 01:43:24,780
And I think it's in response to the, like the objection non-responsive, it's like, I'm

1859
01:43:24,780 --> 01:43:28,940
not even getting engaged with this thread you're going down.

1860
01:43:28,940 --> 01:43:29,940
Totally.

1861
01:43:29,940 --> 01:43:30,940
That means nothing.

1862
01:43:30,940 --> 01:43:35,540
God, that, that moment of, listen, I'll take care of my client.

1863
01:43:35,540 --> 01:43:37,700
The fuck you are.

1864
01:43:37,700 --> 01:43:45,060
Yeah, this is, this is not Barnes.

1865
01:43:45,060 --> 01:43:52,300
So in this next clip, uh, Alex continues down this line and he, it's, it's unfortunate what

1866
01:43:52,300 --> 01:43:55,140
happens when he gets into show mode in the wrong settings.

1867
01:43:55,140 --> 01:43:57,260
Oh, so, so here's the deal.

1868
01:43:57,260 --> 01:43:58,580
Here's the deal.

1869
01:43:58,580 --> 01:44:02,960
The court of public opinion knows that people have a right to ask questions.

1870
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:06,100
Now in hindsight, I saw the families, it looked pretty legitimate.

1871
01:44:06,100 --> 01:44:08,140
Some of the anomalies turned out to not be true.

1872
01:44:08,140 --> 01:44:09,760
And then I said, I was sorry.

1873
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:10,960
And then I got sued.

1874
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:14,880
And so let's just not sit here and pretend that Alex Jones is in red pajamas, like the

1875
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:18,040
devil running around attacking all these people and that's not the case.

1876
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:19,040
Let's see if we can.

1877
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:20,040
Okay.

1878
01:44:20,040 --> 01:44:24,220
So if Neil has spent these last moments of his son has this cherished memory putting

1879
01:44:24,220 --> 01:44:31,300
his hand through his son's hair and then he sees Mr. Shroyer and then you right.

1880
01:44:31,300 --> 01:44:37,500
Get on TV and draw serious doubt about whether he even held his son, whether he's telling

1881
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:38,500
the truth.

1882
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:42,500
And he did that after he had asked you to stop.

1883
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:45,760
You can understand why that man might have some negative feelings about it.

1884
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:49,860
And you can understand how he's on TV on a national program attacking us.

1885
01:44:49,860 --> 01:44:50,860
Yeah.

1886
01:44:50,860 --> 01:44:51,860
You know why he did that?

1887
01:44:51,860 --> 01:44:52,860
Yeah.

1888
01:44:52,860 --> 01:44:53,860
Tell me why.

1889
01:44:53,860 --> 01:44:54,860
Why do you do that?

1890
01:44:54,860 --> 01:44:57,560
Because Megan Kelly went and organized the whole thing for publicity to go after the

1891
01:44:57,560 --> 01:44:58,560
second amendment.

1892
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:02,940
They stepped into this, used it for political purposes, went after the American people and

1893
01:45:02,940 --> 01:45:07,320
then get surprised when people think it might be staged, might be, or it might be synthetic.

1894
01:45:07,320 --> 01:45:15,500
You think Neil hustling went on national television to ask you to stop as part of a plot to what

1895
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:16,660
destroy the second amendment?

1896
01:45:16,660 --> 01:45:21,420
There are the interests behind it and the money and, and, and the, the, the financing.

1897
01:45:21,420 --> 01:45:22,940
I don't care about those people.

1898
01:45:22,940 --> 01:45:24,780
I don't represent any of those people.

1899
01:45:24,780 --> 01:45:26,820
I don't represent Megan Kelly.

1900
01:45:26,820 --> 01:45:30,620
I had Megan Kelly in this chair right now, believe me, I'd be talking to her some things.

1901
01:45:30,620 --> 01:45:36,700
So now Alex has gotten himself into a strange position where he's trying to claim that these

1902
01:45:36,700 --> 01:45:42,220
people were doing these, the sort of pageants to attack the second amendment.

1903
01:45:42,220 --> 01:45:46,660
And it's fun when you're on a radio show and you can just broadly say these things.

1904
01:45:46,660 --> 01:45:47,660
No one will push back.

1905
01:45:47,660 --> 01:45:50,940
But then when you're asked about specifics of like, we're talking about my client here,

1906
01:45:50,940 --> 01:45:52,940
is that what you're saying?

1907
01:45:52,940 --> 01:45:55,380
I mean, well, okay.

1908
01:45:55,380 --> 01:45:56,540
All right.

1909
01:45:56,540 --> 01:46:00,720
Having to dance around all these things and ask to like, to be specific is like kryptonite

1910
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:01,720
for Alex.

1911
01:46:01,720 --> 01:46:03,980
And you can see that.

1912
01:46:03,980 --> 01:46:11,220
And he tries to continue to justify a lot of his behavior because of a notion that the

1913
01:46:11,220 --> 01:46:16,500
Sandy Hook parents got political and that made it so he had to fight them.

1914
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:17,500
Right.

1915
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:23,140
Do you have any reason to dispute that these parents' grieving process over the past eight

1916
01:46:23,140 --> 01:46:28,940
years has been impacted by Infowars actions as it regards Sandy Hook?

1917
01:46:28,940 --> 01:46:31,620
Objection form.

1918
01:46:31,620 --> 01:46:32,660
That's a hypothetical question.

1919
01:46:32,660 --> 01:46:35,380
I can't speak to their emotions.

1920
01:46:35,380 --> 01:46:37,180
There's nothing hypothetical about it, Mr. Jones.

1921
01:46:37,180 --> 01:46:39,100
I did not kill their children.

1922
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:44,300
They became political and used that death to then for their advocacy against the right

1923
01:46:44,300 --> 01:46:45,700
to keep and bear arms.

1924
01:46:45,700 --> 01:46:51,820
And so that directly put them in opposition politically with me.

1925
01:46:51,820 --> 01:46:54,620
And so they stepped into that political arena.

1926
01:46:54,620 --> 01:46:57,060
What did Senator Posner do politically about guns?

1927
01:46:57,060 --> 01:46:59,060
What did he do?

1928
01:46:59,060 --> 01:47:05,060
Did he ever say anything about guns publicly?

1929
01:47:05,060 --> 01:47:09,500
I'm talking about the whole Sandy Hook situation in general and then some of the parents.

1930
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:10,500
Okay.

1931
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:12,980
Did Scarlet Lewis ever say anything about guns?

1932
01:47:12,980 --> 01:47:14,740
I don't have it all in front of me.

1933
01:47:14,740 --> 01:47:17,060
That's such an illustrative moment.

1934
01:47:17,060 --> 01:47:20,580
Alex is trying to come up with a justification for his actions because he's being confronted

1935
01:47:20,580 --> 01:47:23,620
with the reality that he traumatized these parents with his shit.

1936
01:47:23,620 --> 01:47:27,220
And the place he decides to land is that they use their children's deaths for political

1937
01:47:27,220 --> 01:47:29,460
gain against the Second Amendment.

1938
01:47:29,460 --> 01:47:33,700
Mark's rebuttal is so revealing because Alex can't name a single thing that these two people

1939
01:47:33,700 --> 01:47:37,280
who are suing Alex ever did in terms of gun advocacy.

1940
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:40,500
He has no idea what these people did or didn't do.

1941
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:44,660
His response was just the normal kind of dodge he'll use when he's being questioned by some

1942
01:47:44,660 --> 01:47:49,060
shithead like Rogan who will just go along with whatever Alex says.

1943
01:47:49,060 --> 01:47:51,760
Here's why this is key to understand.

1944
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:55,160
Alex didn't say or do the things he did about the particular parents who were suing him

1945
01:47:55,160 --> 01:47:58,220
because they were in opposition to the Second Amendment.

1946
01:47:58,220 --> 01:48:02,620
What happened was that Alex saw the conversation surrounding Sandy Hook and the shooting there

1947
01:48:02,620 --> 01:48:07,260
as being a threat to his guns, so he decided that the Sandy Hook parents were one uniform

1948
01:48:07,260 --> 01:48:10,780
group which he needed to attack to change the narrative.

1949
01:48:10,780 --> 01:48:15,180
Alex didn't really care about any of them or what they were doing or not doing individually.

1950
01:48:15,180 --> 01:48:19,080
He saw the collection of families as an entity he could attack and paint as coming after

1951
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:23,080
the Second Amendment, and portraying them as being actors is a really easy, convenient

1952
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:25,980
way to invalidate them to his audience.

1953
01:48:25,980 --> 01:48:30,300
Maybe some of the parents were involved in gun-related activism, so to Alex that means

1954
01:48:30,300 --> 01:48:34,140
they all were, and they were using the shooting to push their agenda.

1955
01:48:34,140 --> 01:48:39,060
To undermine what he perceived as them using the shooting for political gain, Alex attacked

1956
01:48:39,060 --> 01:48:43,600
individual parents because he felt that by doing so, he was invalidating the group as

1957
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:46,540
a whole and protecting the Second Amendment.

1958
01:48:46,540 --> 01:48:50,780
It's pretty clear based on the way he's describing his thought pattern.

1959
01:48:50,780 --> 01:48:56,820
And this is when I would go back to the earlier question about Neal Hestland when he was on

1960
01:48:56,820 --> 01:49:03,160
Megyn Kelly and Mark really forced Alex to get to this place of like, yes, I get it.

1961
01:49:03,160 --> 01:49:06,720
If he, I mean, he's a human being.

1962
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:10,060
If your son has died and you hold him, I get that that would hurt.

1963
01:49:10,060 --> 01:49:11,300
I get that.

1964
01:49:11,300 --> 01:49:16,140
And then even then he can try and justify his behavior after that, but once you've established

1965
01:49:16,140 --> 01:49:22,540
that he can look at another human being and say, yes, my actions hurt you, that is underlying

1966
01:49:22,540 --> 01:49:23,900
all of these justifications.

1967
01:49:23,900 --> 01:49:29,340
You kind of have to go back to like, just most elementary, let's get agreement about

1968
01:49:29,340 --> 01:49:30,340
air.

1969
01:49:30,340 --> 01:49:31,340
Totally.

1970
01:49:31,340 --> 01:49:32,340
Totally.

1971
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:33,340
Do we breathe?

1972
01:49:33,340 --> 01:49:34,340
Right.

1973
01:49:34,340 --> 01:49:35,500
But you know you hurt them.

1974
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:37,720
You can understand that.

1975
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:43,420
And so then whatever justification you have is still undercut by the fact that you know

1976
01:49:43,420 --> 01:49:44,660
that you hurt them.

1977
01:49:44,660 --> 01:49:45,660
Right.

1978
01:49:45,660 --> 01:49:49,980
And even in that case, even with that established, Alex could still retreat to the idea that

1979
01:49:49,980 --> 01:49:53,700
hurting them is an unfortunate byproduct of defending the Second Amendment.

1980
01:49:53,700 --> 01:49:54,700
Sure.

1981
01:49:54,700 --> 01:49:56,500
He could probably justify that in his own head.

1982
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:58,100
It still doesn't sound good.

1983
01:49:58,100 --> 01:49:59,500
That's what I guess, exactly.

1984
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:03,420
But I think we're well and far beyond anything sounding good.

1985
01:50:03,420 --> 01:50:04,420
Right.

1986
01:50:04,420 --> 01:50:05,420
Right.

1987
01:50:05,420 --> 01:50:07,720
I think that train has left the station.

1988
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:13,860
So this seems to be a bit of a pattern of behavior that Alex has.

1989
01:50:13,860 --> 01:50:15,940
This is laid out.

1990
01:50:15,940 --> 01:50:21,460
And this is where I really was like, this is where I think turned.

1991
01:50:21,460 --> 01:50:24,300
And I was really shocked that this was happening.

1992
01:50:24,300 --> 01:50:28,720
So we know in 2012, right when it happened, you got on TV and started talking about it

1993
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:29,720
being staged.

1994
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:30,720
Right.

1995
01:50:30,720 --> 01:50:31,720
We know that.

1996
01:50:31,720 --> 01:50:33,420
Soon thereafter, I had questions.

1997
01:50:33,420 --> 01:50:36,420
No, Mr. Jones, I don't understand this whole thing about questions.

1998
01:50:36,420 --> 01:50:37,420
I don't get this.

1999
01:50:37,420 --> 01:50:40,260
If you say Sandy Hook is fake, that's not a question, right?

2000
01:50:40,260 --> 01:50:41,940
That was that was years later.

2001
01:50:41,940 --> 01:50:46,340
I can see how people think it's absolutely fake.

2002
01:50:46,340 --> 01:50:49,180
There's no quote of you saying I can see how people that doesn't exist.

2003
01:50:49,180 --> 01:50:50,180
You keep repeating that.

2004
01:50:50,180 --> 01:50:51,180
It doesn't exist.

2005
01:50:51,180 --> 01:50:52,180
Okay.

2006
01:50:52,180 --> 01:50:53,180
Well, that's what I remember there.

2007
01:50:53,180 --> 01:50:56,220
We, in our last deposition, I showed you clip after clip of you saying it's totally synthetic,

2008
01:50:56,220 --> 01:50:57,740
completely made up with actors.

2009
01:50:57,740 --> 01:51:02,740
At first I thought they killed real kids, but nope, they didn't that that's that's that's

2010
01:51:02,740 --> 01:51:03,740
that's that was my thought.

2011
01:51:03,740 --> 01:51:04,740
That's what you said.

2012
01:51:04,740 --> 01:51:05,740
Yep.

2013
01:51:05,740 --> 01:51:06,740
Yep.

2014
01:51:06,740 --> 01:51:08,040
And you did that in 2014.

2015
01:51:08,040 --> 01:51:09,040
You did it.

2016
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:10,040
He did it in 2013.

2017
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:11,040
You did it in 2014.

2018
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:12,040
You did it in 2015.

2019
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:13,040
You did it in 2016.

2020
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:14,040
You did it in 2017.

2021
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:15,040
Correct?

2022
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:16,040
Projection four.

2023
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:19,780
I'd have to go back and look, but I definitely said that I had serious questions about it

2024
01:51:19,780 --> 01:51:21,460
and could see how it was.

2025
01:51:21,460 --> 01:51:23,660
It was staged with all the all the bizarreness, man.

2026
01:51:23,660 --> 01:51:24,660
I tell you.

2027
01:51:24,660 --> 01:51:25,660
No.

2028
01:51:25,660 --> 01:51:26,660
Mr. Jones, let me just make something really clear.

2029
01:51:26,660 --> 01:51:30,900
If you if you had gone on and said, man, Sandy Hook looks weird, there's a bunch of weird

2030
01:51:30,900 --> 01:51:31,900
stuff going on.

2031
01:51:31,900 --> 01:51:32,900
God, it's weird.

2032
01:51:32,900 --> 01:51:33,900
Look at this weird thing.

2033
01:51:33,900 --> 01:51:34,900
This thing's weird.

2034
01:51:34,900 --> 01:51:35,900
And I don't know what's going on.

2035
01:51:35,900 --> 01:51:37,780
And somebody needs to answer these questions.

2036
01:51:37,780 --> 01:51:40,440
You wouldn't be here today, okay?

2037
01:51:40,440 --> 01:51:44,580
The reason the statements that I want to talk to you about is you admit that over those

2038
01:51:44,580 --> 01:51:49,660
five years, you repeatedly, without equivocation, said it was fake.

2039
01:51:49,660 --> 01:51:51,340
The children didn't die.

2040
01:51:51,340 --> 01:51:55,280
There were actors playing the different parts of different people.

2041
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:56,740
You said those things.

2042
01:51:56,740 --> 01:51:59,180
Can you now just admit that for the jury that you said them?

2043
01:51:59,180 --> 01:52:00,180
They're going to see the videos.

2044
01:52:00,180 --> 01:52:01,180
Can you?

2045
01:52:01,180 --> 01:52:02,180
Sure.

2046
01:52:02,180 --> 01:52:03,180
They should investigate Sandy Hook themselves.

2047
01:52:03,180 --> 01:52:04,180
Whoa.

2048
01:52:04,180 --> 01:52:05,180
Wild.

2049
01:52:05,180 --> 01:52:06,180
At the end.

2050
01:52:06,180 --> 01:52:07,180
Fucking wild.

2051
01:52:07,180 --> 01:52:10,180
At the end there, I almost gasped when I heard that response.

2052
01:52:10,180 --> 01:52:14,360
This is getting so defensive and he's having to try and pass off so many flimsy arguments

2053
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:15,740
that it seems like something just snapped.

2054
01:52:15,740 --> 01:52:18,620
Like, yeah, they should go go investigate Sandy Hook.

2055
01:52:18,620 --> 01:52:22,180
I couldn't believe my ears, but then this goes on.

2056
01:52:22,180 --> 01:52:24,620
Can you now just admit that for the jury that you said them?

2057
01:52:24,620 --> 01:52:25,620
They're going to see the videos.

2058
01:52:25,620 --> 01:52:26,620
Can you?

2059
01:52:26,620 --> 01:52:27,620
Well, sure.

2060
01:52:27,620 --> 01:52:28,620
They should investigate Sandy Hook themselves.

2061
01:52:28,620 --> 01:52:29,620
Hold on.

2062
01:52:29,620 --> 01:52:30,620
Objection form.

2063
01:52:30,620 --> 01:52:35,680
They should look into it themselves and see why people ask questions.

2064
01:52:35,680 --> 01:52:36,680
You hope they don't.

2065
01:52:36,680 --> 01:52:38,420
No, I really hope they do.

2066
01:52:38,420 --> 01:52:39,420
Okay?

2067
01:52:39,420 --> 01:52:45,300
I feel like Alex is really deeply implying that he is right or was right about it being

2068
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:46,300
fake.

2069
01:52:46,300 --> 01:52:47,300
I think he's saying that it's still fake.

2070
01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:49,860
I think he's absolutely contending that it is still fake.

2071
01:52:49,860 --> 01:52:55,180
It's such a bizarre thing, but you can tell if you're watching this or listening to it

2072
01:52:55,180 --> 01:53:00,060
even, you can tell that it is a sort of visceral response.

2073
01:53:00,060 --> 01:53:01,860
That's a lashing out.

2074
01:53:01,860 --> 01:53:07,020
There's a bit of a anger behind, like, people should look into it.

2075
01:53:07,020 --> 01:53:12,420
And I think it's largely motivated by so many attempts at deflection and stuff just not

2076
01:53:12,420 --> 01:53:13,680
really working out.

2077
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:14,680
Still not hitting.

2078
01:53:14,680 --> 01:53:15,680
Yeah.

2079
01:53:15,680 --> 01:53:20,920
And I think that that's maybe the value in sort of cutting off exits and like, okay,

2080
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:24,140
now you've nowhere to go other than you now are going to...

2081
01:53:24,140 --> 01:53:30,180
I mean, you also have to cut off the physical exits as well as the financial exits as well

2082
01:53:30,180 --> 01:53:31,180
as...

2083
01:53:31,180 --> 01:53:35,260
We've had to cut off a lot of exits to get to a place where Alex is here.

2084
01:53:35,260 --> 01:53:36,900
It's true.

2085
01:53:36,900 --> 01:53:43,020
So after that outburst, I do enjoy that, like, you're afraid that they're going to look into

2086
01:53:43,020 --> 01:53:44,020
this.

2087
01:53:44,020 --> 01:53:46,140
I mean, bananas, man.

2088
01:53:46,140 --> 01:53:47,140
Yeah.

2089
01:53:47,140 --> 01:53:48,140
Bananas.

2090
01:53:48,140 --> 01:53:50,900
So we now get to some more emails.

2091
01:53:50,900 --> 01:53:51,900
And one of them...

2092
01:53:51,900 --> 01:53:52,900
But what about her emails?

2093
01:53:52,900 --> 01:53:53,900
Oh, hashtag.

2094
01:53:53,900 --> 01:53:54,900
Log her up.

2095
01:53:54,900 --> 01:53:55,900
Hey, come on!

2096
01:53:55,900 --> 01:53:56,900
Hey, come on!

2097
01:53:56,900 --> 01:53:57,900
Remember that?

2098
01:53:57,900 --> 01:53:58,900
Let's play it back, everybody!

2099
01:53:58,900 --> 01:53:59,900
It's 2015 again!

2100
01:53:59,900 --> 01:54:00,900
No.

2101
01:54:00,900 --> 01:54:03,340
Turns out we're going to talk about some emails that have to do with Jim Fetzer.

2102
01:54:03,340 --> 01:54:04,340
Okay.

2103
01:54:04,340 --> 01:54:12,060
So before we broke, we had talked about whether Infowars had ever promoted or directed people

2104
01:54:12,060 --> 01:54:16,420
to Jim Fetzer's book, tried to get more viewership for Jim Fetzer's book, and you weren't aware

2105
01:54:16,420 --> 01:54:18,420
of that, right?

2106
01:54:18,420 --> 01:54:19,420
Not in my memory.

2107
01:54:19,420 --> 01:54:20,420
Okay.

2108
01:54:20,420 --> 01:54:26,020
I'm going to show you what I've marked as Exhibit 9, and I'm going to go through this

2109
01:54:26,020 --> 01:54:30,560
whole thing with you to see if it reflects your memory, or if it refreshes your memory.

2110
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:32,780
So he has no memory of promoting Fetzer's book?

2111
01:54:32,780 --> 01:54:33,780
Never heard of it.

2112
01:54:33,780 --> 01:54:34,780
No.

2113
01:54:34,780 --> 01:54:40,580
I want to start at the bottom with Alan Powell's email, and he says, Rob, Jim Fetzer put together

2114
01:54:40,580 --> 01:54:44,340
a book on Sandy Hook to which I contributed two chapters.

2115
01:54:44,340 --> 01:54:47,060
Amazon have decided they won't handle it.

2116
01:54:47,060 --> 01:54:52,380
I think Jim would agree to it being distributed by Infowars free as a PDF.

2117
01:54:52,380 --> 01:54:54,420
We were both just on the phone...

2118
01:54:54,420 --> 01:55:01,140
We were both just on the Jeff Rinsch show today, and Jim gave that right of distribution

2119
01:55:01,140 --> 01:55:02,680
to Jeff.

2120
01:55:02,680 --> 01:55:08,580
And you see if Alex would have Jim and Jim Tracy on to promote the book and talk a bit

2121
01:55:08,580 --> 01:55:11,660
about the still running sore of Sandy Hook.

2122
01:55:11,660 --> 01:55:16,140
I spoke to Jim Fetzer about this today and said he will speak to you.

2123
01:55:16,140 --> 01:55:20,180
If you flip over onto the back part of the page, you just see it says, Cheers, Alan Powell.

2124
01:55:20,180 --> 01:55:22,060
So did I read that email correctly?

2125
01:55:22,060 --> 01:55:23,060
Yes.

2126
01:55:23,060 --> 01:55:24,060
Okay.

2127
01:55:24,060 --> 01:55:25,060
The next message is from Jim.

2128
01:55:25,060 --> 01:55:26,060
Okay.

2129
01:55:26,060 --> 01:55:27,860
Before we go on to Jim Fetzer's message, you know who Jeff Rinsch is?

2130
01:55:27,860 --> 01:55:28,860
Yes.

2131
01:55:28,860 --> 01:55:29,860
Okay.

2132
01:55:29,860 --> 01:55:33,500
And Paul Watson also telling you at the same time that he told you that Jim Fetzer was

2133
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:35,940
batshit crazy, that Jeff Rinsch was batshit crazy.

2134
01:55:35,940 --> 01:55:37,580
Do you remember that?

2135
01:55:37,580 --> 01:55:38,580
No.

2136
01:55:38,580 --> 01:55:39,580
Okay.

2137
01:55:39,580 --> 01:55:43,620
Going up to Jim Fetzer's email, or he identifies himself as Jim and James.

2138
01:55:43,620 --> 01:55:46,060
So it's going to be used both in this document.

2139
01:55:46,060 --> 01:55:50,820
But he says, Rob, we are making the book available to the public for free.

2140
01:55:50,820 --> 01:55:52,580
Here's the cover in PDF.

2141
01:55:52,580 --> 01:55:54,300
Several sites are now offering it.

2142
01:55:54,300 --> 01:55:56,860
I would be glad if Alex were to do the same.

2143
01:55:56,860 --> 01:56:01,560
I am sure James would be glad to come on with me if Alex wanted to interview us about this

2144
01:56:01,560 --> 01:56:02,900
stunning event.

2145
01:56:02,900 --> 01:56:05,580
I think the latest case was the Pentagon Papers.

2146
01:56:05,580 --> 01:56:07,580
Do I read that correctly?

2147
01:56:07,580 --> 01:56:08,580
Yes.

2148
01:56:08,580 --> 01:56:09,580
Okay.

2149
01:56:09,580 --> 01:56:13,580
And then Rob Dew writes back to Jim Fetzer, says, thanks for the heads up, sent the links

2150
01:56:13,580 --> 01:56:16,940
to at Dawn, and he is writing an article about it.

2151
01:56:16,940 --> 01:56:20,460
Please let us know if there is a bump in downloads, Rob.

2152
01:56:20,460 --> 01:56:22,460
Did I read that correct?

2153
01:56:22,460 --> 01:56:23,460
Yes.

2154
01:56:23,460 --> 01:56:24,460
Okay.

2155
01:56:24,460 --> 01:56:25,460
That's not great.

2156
01:56:25,460 --> 01:56:31,980
I think getting these emails that are asking for promotion, you know, like maybe you can

2157
01:56:31,980 --> 01:56:33,980
dance around.

2158
01:56:33,980 --> 01:56:35,060
We get a lot of emails.

2159
01:56:35,060 --> 01:56:41,300
But when Rob Dew is writing back, hey, I've sent this on to a Don Salazar who's writing

2160
01:56:41,300 --> 01:56:42,300
about it.

2161
01:56:42,300 --> 01:56:45,420
Please let us know if our ad campaign for you is effective.

2162
01:56:45,420 --> 01:56:46,660
That's so bad.

2163
01:56:46,660 --> 01:56:51,100
The moment you said, let us know if there's a bump in traffic, you are Rico'd.

2164
01:56:51,100 --> 01:56:53,740
Like you're in the fucking case, man.

2165
01:56:53,740 --> 01:56:56,940
If I said it to them, I would expect to be in the fucking case.

2166
01:56:56,940 --> 01:57:03,280
I mean, at very least you're admitting a, at least a curiosity based interest in how

2167
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:04,280
things go.

2168
01:57:04,280 --> 01:57:05,280
Yeah.

2169
01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:06,280
Yeah.

2170
01:57:06,280 --> 01:57:07,280
Yeah.

2171
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:08,280
That's a pretty bad look.

2172
01:57:08,280 --> 01:57:12,460
I mean, because if you're, you're not curious, just like, Ooh, I wouldn't be interesting.

2173
01:57:12,460 --> 01:57:15,780
You're curious to see if you should do it yourself or again.

2174
01:57:15,780 --> 01:57:16,780
Yeah.

2175
01:57:16,780 --> 01:57:19,340
See if this is something that people are interested in.

2176
01:57:19,340 --> 01:57:20,340
Yes.

2177
01:57:20,340 --> 01:57:21,340
Please give me market research.

2178
01:57:21,340 --> 01:57:23,340
Does this attract our audience?

2179
01:57:23,340 --> 01:57:24,340
Really?

2180
01:57:24,340 --> 01:57:29,620
So a Fetzer's information is largely what was behind the zero hedge article that Owen

2181
01:57:29,620 --> 01:57:33,460
read in the video that ended up being part of this lawsuit.

2182
01:57:33,460 --> 01:57:34,460
Yeah.

2183
01:57:34,460 --> 01:57:35,460
Yeah.

2184
01:57:35,460 --> 01:57:39,460
And so Mark has a little point about this actual zero hedge article that seems to be

2185
01:57:39,460 --> 01:57:40,460
missed.

2186
01:57:40,460 --> 01:57:42,180
Let me show you a marked as exhibit 10.

2187
01:57:42,180 --> 01:57:43,180
You recognize that?

2188
01:57:43,180 --> 01:57:44,180
Yes.

2189
01:57:44,180 --> 01:57:45,180
Okay.

2190
01:57:45,180 --> 01:57:52,180
Can you tell us what this is?

2191
01:57:52,180 --> 01:57:54,540
Zero hedge article.

2192
01:57:54,540 --> 01:57:58,140
Do you know why it might be relevant to this lawsuit?

2193
01:57:58,140 --> 01:58:03,940
This is the article Owen was reading that he's been sued for and the coverage I gave

2194
01:58:03,940 --> 01:58:05,580
him Owen was sued for.

2195
01:58:05,580 --> 01:58:06,580
Okay.

2196
01:58:06,580 --> 01:58:07,580
Good boy.

2197
01:58:07,580 --> 01:58:08,580
Second page for me.

2198
01:58:08,580 --> 01:58:09,580
I want to give him a treat.

2199
01:58:09,580 --> 01:58:13,260
You see there's a big blank space in the middle of the page.

2200
01:58:13,260 --> 01:58:15,560
Seems to be a way it printed from the internet.

2201
01:58:15,560 --> 01:58:19,740
Below that big blank space, do you see where it says, except this does not comport with

2202
01:58:19,740 --> 01:58:20,740
the official story?

2203
01:58:20,740 --> 01:58:21,740
Yes.

2204
01:58:21,740 --> 01:58:22,740
Okay.

2205
01:58:22,740 --> 01:58:27,860
And then it says, Jim Fetzer, professor emeritus at the university of Minnesota who wrote a

2206
01:58:27,860 --> 01:58:33,340
book claiming Sandy Hook was stage notes that based on the facts of the case, Hestland's

2207
01:58:33,340 --> 01:58:38,140
statement that he held his son with a bullet hole through his head could not have happened.

2208
01:58:38,140 --> 01:58:40,420
You, I read that, correct?

2209
01:58:40,420 --> 01:58:41,420
Yes.

2210
01:58:41,420 --> 01:58:42,420
Okay.

2211
01:58:42,420 --> 01:58:46,020
Now I want you to flip to the third page.

2212
01:58:46,020 --> 01:58:49,380
You see that first sentence, the first paragraph there.

2213
01:58:49,380 --> 01:58:51,860
That's just one long sentence.

2214
01:58:51,860 --> 01:58:52,860
Yes.

2215
01:58:52,860 --> 01:58:53,860
Okay.

2216
01:58:53,860 --> 01:58:57,580
And how that paragraph begins is by saying it's entirely possible that Mr. Hestland had

2217
01:58:57,580 --> 01:58:59,220
access to his son after that.

2218
01:58:59,220 --> 01:59:00,820
Do you see where it says that?

2219
01:59:00,820 --> 01:59:01,820
Yes.

2220
01:59:01,820 --> 01:59:02,820
Okay.

2221
01:59:02,820 --> 01:59:03,820
That wasn't said by Info Wars though, right?

2222
01:59:03,820 --> 01:59:05,820
I don't have the clip in front of me.

2223
01:59:05,820 --> 01:59:06,820
Okay.

2224
01:59:06,820 --> 01:59:07,820
Ooh.

2225
01:59:07,820 --> 01:59:12,220
See, here's the problem with their shoddy strategy of never reading the things that

2226
01:59:12,220 --> 01:59:13,220
they cover.

2227
01:59:13,220 --> 01:59:14,220
You should probably do that.

2228
01:59:14,220 --> 01:59:19,740
The actual article that they're getting sued over actually says in it that, hey, maybe

2229
01:59:19,740 --> 01:59:26,000
he did hold his son, but they ignored that portion of the story and used it just to justify

2230
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,060
a position of, hey, he couldn't have.

2231
01:59:28,060 --> 01:59:29,060
Okay.

2232
01:59:29,060 --> 01:59:31,260
Well, one way makes money and the other one doesn't.

2233
01:59:31,260 --> 01:59:33,940
I feel like we both know which way works.

2234
01:59:33,940 --> 01:59:35,420
Yep.

2235
01:59:35,420 --> 01:59:39,740
That's an unfortunate thing to have to see right in front of you.

2236
01:59:39,740 --> 01:59:42,060
Man, I really would.

2237
01:59:42,060 --> 01:59:44,600
And this might be the crazy thing for me, right?

2238
01:59:44,600 --> 01:59:50,060
But if I had spent my entire career not reading things and then suddenly was starting to be

2239
01:59:50,060 --> 01:59:59,020
told more and more terrifyingly that the lawsuits weren't going well, I would take maybe a whole

2240
01:59:59,020 --> 02:00:02,780
week to just really read through everything that I'm supposed to know about.

2241
02:00:02,780 --> 02:00:03,780
Yeah.

2242
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:08,060
That way I wouldn't be surprised when I was in a deposition and maybe I wouldn't get caught

2243
02:00:08,060 --> 02:00:09,460
in so many of these fucking traps.

2244
02:00:09,460 --> 02:00:15,740
You don't want to have a consistent heavy breath of grief throughout a deposition.

2245
02:00:15,740 --> 02:00:16,740
Not good.

2246
02:00:16,740 --> 02:00:17,740
Not good.

2247
02:00:17,740 --> 02:00:18,740
Oh no.

2248
02:00:18,740 --> 02:00:22,100
Deflation is not a ongoing thing you want to feel.

2249
02:00:22,100 --> 02:00:23,900
You want to be deflated and then done.

2250
02:00:23,900 --> 02:00:25,940
You don't want to constantly keep going.

2251
02:00:25,940 --> 02:00:31,340
Your response to seeing something that is really unfortunate and damning shouldn't

2252
02:00:31,340 --> 02:00:33,060
be, oh no, not again.

2253
02:00:33,060 --> 02:00:34,380
That's bad.

2254
02:00:34,380 --> 02:00:36,500
Ooh, you got me.

2255
02:00:36,500 --> 02:00:37,500
Ugh.

2256
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:38,500
Again.

2257
02:00:38,500 --> 02:00:39,500
No one else in me.

2258
02:00:39,500 --> 02:00:44,500
So the idea about Alex's relationship with Jim Fetzer is supposed to be that he didn't

2259
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:51,580
trust him as a source for, you know, even before the whole way, the 2017, getting sued

2260
02:00:51,580 --> 02:00:52,580
and stuff.

2261
02:00:52,580 --> 02:00:53,580
No, he doesn't.

2262
02:00:53,580 --> 02:00:54,580
So this is weird.

2263
02:00:54,580 --> 02:00:55,580
Okay.

2264
02:00:55,580 --> 02:01:00,600
I've shown you what I've marked as exhibit 11.

2265
02:01:00,600 --> 02:01:04,460
And I know that this has a real, like, it has a lot of stuff and it's in really tiny

2266
02:01:04,460 --> 02:01:05,460
print.

2267
02:01:05,460 --> 02:01:06,460
I may not, yeah.

2268
02:01:06,460 --> 02:01:07,460
Yeah.

2269
02:01:07,460 --> 02:01:08,460
I know.

2270
02:01:08,460 --> 02:01:11,820
It's the only thing that I'm actually, I think when we get into this document, we'll quickly

2271
02:01:11,820 --> 02:01:16,100
discover that it may not be necessary to even read all of this stuff, but if so, I may need

2272
02:01:16,100 --> 02:01:19,260
to give you some time to go read it if you want to do that.

2273
02:01:19,260 --> 02:01:25,140
But what I want to ask you about this document is up at the very top, you see that this is

2274
02:01:25,140 --> 02:01:29,420
an email on June 29th, 2018.

2275
02:01:29,420 --> 02:01:30,420
Okay.

2276
02:01:30,420 --> 02:01:32,420
That's about a month after you were sued.

2277
02:01:32,420 --> 02:01:33,900
You understand that?

2278
02:01:33,900 --> 02:01:34,900
Okay.

2279
02:01:34,900 --> 02:01:36,420
I don't know what's in this email.

2280
02:01:36,420 --> 02:01:38,340
What was Nico's job title at that time?

2281
02:01:38,340 --> 02:01:39,340
He's a radio producer.

2282
02:01:39,340 --> 02:01:40,340
Okay.

2283
02:01:40,340 --> 02:01:42,060
And then Daria, what's her title?

2284
02:01:42,060 --> 02:01:44,540
She was sound operator then.

2285
02:01:44,540 --> 02:01:45,540
Okay.

2286
02:01:45,540 --> 02:01:47,620
And today she's a producer as well, right?

2287
02:01:47,620 --> 02:01:48,620
Yes.

2288
02:01:48,620 --> 02:01:49,620
Okay.

2289
02:01:49,620 --> 02:01:53,900
And so Daria is sending this to Nico and the subject is forward vanishing blog.

2290
02:01:53,900 --> 02:01:59,280
Not only is Noah Posner a fiction, but his father Lenny is also a fake.

2291
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:00,820
Have you ever seen this email?

2292
02:02:00,820 --> 02:02:01,820
No.

2293
02:02:01,820 --> 02:02:02,820
Okay.

2294
02:02:02,820 --> 02:02:03,820
I don't think I need to ask you anything else about it then.

2295
02:02:03,820 --> 02:02:07,820
If you've never read this, I don't think we need to talk about it.

2296
02:02:07,820 --> 02:02:08,820
Okay.

2297
02:02:08,820 --> 02:02:12,060
Now, maybe I should talk about it.

2298
02:02:12,060 --> 02:02:15,820
Do you have any idea why Nico would be sending things to Daria from Jim Fetzer right after

2299
02:02:15,820 --> 02:02:19,980
you were sued?

2300
02:02:19,980 --> 02:02:22,780
I mean, no, I have no idea.

2301
02:02:22,780 --> 02:02:23,780
Okay.

2302
02:02:23,780 --> 02:02:27,540
And I can't have an idea.

2303
02:02:27,540 --> 02:02:32,380
I find this to be very surprising because-

2304
02:02:32,380 --> 02:02:33,380
Is it?

2305
02:02:33,380 --> 02:02:34,380
Well, I mean-

2306
02:02:34,380 --> 02:02:35,580
It's revelatory.

2307
02:02:35,580 --> 02:02:36,580
It is revelatory.

2308
02:02:36,580 --> 02:02:37,580
It's not surprising.

2309
02:02:37,580 --> 02:02:42,820
I think what's more surprising to me is that it appears as though he still thinks he's

2310
02:02:42,820 --> 02:02:44,540
got a chance.

2311
02:02:44,540 --> 02:02:45,540
You know?

2312
02:02:45,540 --> 02:02:50,260
It really feels like the way he's talking, he's like, okay, maybe I lost on this question.

2313
02:02:50,260 --> 02:02:54,580
Maybe I'm losing on this one, but next one, maybe there's that little glimmer of light

2314
02:02:54,580 --> 02:02:55,580
I can sneak through.

2315
02:02:55,580 --> 02:02:59,660
Well, I mean, I think how do you operate in life if that's not how you feel?

2316
02:02:59,660 --> 02:03:04,340
Man, if I was in this deposition, I would be like, literally everything I say, you're

2317
02:03:04,340 --> 02:03:05,580
going to have a clip for.

2318
02:03:05,580 --> 02:03:10,220
So fucking say whatever you want to say, here's my answers to your questions, yes or no, whatever

2319
02:03:10,220 --> 02:03:11,220
you want.

2320
02:03:11,220 --> 02:03:13,500
I will just say, I don't know over and over again, and then we'll go home.

2321
02:03:13,500 --> 02:03:15,540
And then we'll go home because you won.

2322
02:03:15,540 --> 02:03:17,660
We'll run out the clock on this thing.

2323
02:03:17,660 --> 02:03:20,580
I mean, literally we've already had the default judgment.

2324
02:03:20,580 --> 02:03:21,860
You won, man.

2325
02:03:21,860 --> 02:03:22,860
Yeah.

2326
02:03:22,860 --> 02:03:28,980
So of course there are more documents and we're shifting now over into the Wolfgang

2327
02:03:28,980 --> 02:03:32,500
Halbig section of some of these documents.

2328
02:03:32,500 --> 02:03:37,340
And Mark brings up this email and he reads it, this is a bit of a longer clip, but this

2329
02:03:37,340 --> 02:03:39,720
email is important.

2330
02:03:39,720 --> 02:03:44,940
And I believe that, you know, some of the goal of this is just to establish and make

2331
02:03:44,940 --> 02:03:48,060
Alex recognize like, this dude's a bad source.

2332
02:03:48,060 --> 02:03:49,900
We shouldn't, you shouldn't be trusting this guy.

2333
02:03:49,900 --> 02:03:50,900
Let's get down to this.

2334
02:03:50,900 --> 02:03:53,220
I want to talk a little bit about Wolfgang Halbig.

2335
02:03:53,220 --> 02:03:56,700
Do you know what I mean when I talk about the Super Bowl picture?

2336
02:03:56,700 --> 02:03:57,700
No.

2337
02:03:57,700 --> 02:03:58,700
Okay.

2338
02:03:58,700 --> 02:04:02,180
Do you know what I mean when I talk about the Super Bowl choir of fourth graders from

2339
02:04:02,180 --> 02:04:03,180
Sandy Hook?

2340
02:04:03,180 --> 02:04:04,180
Yes.

2341
02:04:04,180 --> 02:04:05,180
I've heard of that.

2342
02:04:05,180 --> 02:04:06,180
Okay.

2343
02:04:06,180 --> 02:04:07,940
And that's when I really started thinking it probably did happen because it just gets

2344
02:04:07,940 --> 02:04:08,940
too, what's this for?

2345
02:04:08,940 --> 02:04:09,940
It's crazy.

2346
02:04:09,940 --> 02:04:10,940
It's just crazy, right?

2347
02:04:10,940 --> 02:04:11,940
Sure.

2348
02:04:11,940 --> 02:04:12,940
That's what happened.

2349
02:04:12,940 --> 02:04:17,820
I've shown you what I've marked as exhibit 12.

2350
02:04:17,820 --> 02:04:22,180
You'll see again at the bottom, there's no Bates number on this one, right?

2351
02:04:22,180 --> 02:04:23,180
No.

2352
02:04:23,180 --> 02:04:24,180
Okay.

2353
02:04:24,180 --> 02:04:32,020
This one is dated 11, 19, 2016 towards the end of 2016.

2354
02:04:32,020 --> 02:04:35,380
It is from Wolfgang Halbig, right?

2355
02:04:35,380 --> 02:04:41,260
The two line, the main people it's sent to include Nico, that's an Info Wars employee,

2356
02:04:41,260 --> 02:04:42,260
right?

2357
02:04:42,260 --> 02:04:43,260
Yes.

2358
02:04:43,260 --> 02:04:48,700
Then the Trump, several, a couple addresses to the Trump organization, correct?

2359
02:04:48,700 --> 02:04:49,700
Yes.

2360
02:04:49,700 --> 02:04:52,660
Rob Dew, who is also another employee of yours, right?

2361
02:04:52,660 --> 02:04:53,660
Yes.

2362
02:04:53,660 --> 02:04:56,020
And then Jay Rince, do you think it would be a fair assumption to say that's probably

2363
02:04:56,020 --> 02:04:57,020
Jeff Rince?

2364
02:04:57,020 --> 02:04:58,020
Yes.

2365
02:04:58,020 --> 02:04:59,020
Okay.

2366
02:04:59,020 --> 02:05:01,980
And then also copied, there's a CC line and there's several other people copied who are

2367
02:05:01,980 --> 02:05:06,980
either media organizations and there's also some government addresses.

2368
02:05:06,980 --> 02:05:08,980
Do you see that?

2369
02:05:08,980 --> 02:05:09,980
Yes.

2370
02:05:09,980 --> 02:05:10,980
Okay.

2371
02:05:10,980 --> 02:05:11,980
No.

2372
02:05:11,980 --> 02:05:12,980
There are also a bunch of attachments listed.

2373
02:05:12,980 --> 02:05:13,980
Do you see that?

2374
02:05:13,980 --> 02:05:14,980
Yes.

2375
02:05:14,980 --> 02:05:15,980
Okay.

2376
02:05:15,980 --> 02:05:18,700
And those attachments appear to be PNG files.

2377
02:05:18,700 --> 02:05:20,300
Those are images, right?

2378
02:05:20,300 --> 02:05:21,300
Yes.

2379
02:05:21,300 --> 02:05:22,300
Okay.

2380
02:05:22,300 --> 02:05:26,220
And then the subject line says, trust, but always verify.

2381
02:05:26,220 --> 02:05:28,020
Please verify with your uncle.

2382
02:05:28,020 --> 02:05:29,020
Thanks.

2383
02:05:29,020 --> 02:05:30,020
Do you see that?

2384
02:05:30,020 --> 02:05:31,020
Yes.

2385
02:05:31,020 --> 02:05:32,020
Okay.

2386
02:05:32,020 --> 02:05:33,020
I'm going to go ahead and read this email to you.

2387
02:05:33,020 --> 02:05:34,020
All right.

2388
02:05:34,020 --> 02:05:35,020
Come on.

2389
02:05:35,020 --> 02:05:36,020
It says Nico and Rob.

2390
02:05:36,020 --> 02:05:40,660
Rob, please send this video to your uncle, the former FBI agent who attended my Connecticut

2391
02:05:40,660 --> 02:05:44,100
freedom of information hearings in Cartford, Connecticut.

2392
02:05:44,100 --> 02:05:49,180
He told me that I was right about what was happening, which gave me a tad more courage.

2393
02:05:49,180 --> 02:05:52,120
He has friends who can verify this video to be accurate.

2394
02:05:52,120 --> 02:05:57,220
And now we know that the children who supposedly died at Sandy Hook are at the Super Bowl on

2395
02:05:57,220 --> 02:05:59,460
February 3rd, 2013.

2396
02:05:59,460 --> 02:06:03,060
And that is why we have never, ever heard them sing again.

2397
02:06:03,060 --> 02:06:04,760
Think about it for just a second.

2398
02:06:04,760 --> 02:06:09,060
They sing before 110 million people worldwide with Jennifer Hudson.

2399
02:06:09,060 --> 02:06:13,720
They have 87,000 people in the stadium of over 3,500 news reporters.

2400
02:06:13,720 --> 02:06:18,300
And we never have one interview in the newspaper of on television from them.

2401
02:06:18,300 --> 02:06:19,300
Why?

2402
02:06:19,300 --> 02:06:24,100
Just think about how much money came flowing in after that February 3rd, 2013 Super Bowl

2403
02:06:24,100 --> 02:06:26,220
performance from across the world.

2404
02:06:26,220 --> 02:06:30,820
Why have they never performed again if they were so great to be asked to sing at the February

2405
02:06:30,820 --> 02:06:32,800
3rd, 2013 Super Bowl?

2406
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:36,440
Why no appearances on the national early morning television shows.

2407
02:06:36,440 --> 02:06:40,600
They sing before 110 million people and they simply disappear.

2408
02:06:40,600 --> 02:06:41,980
Even Beyonce met them.

2409
02:06:41,980 --> 02:06:42,980
Where are they?

2410
02:06:42,980 --> 02:06:48,380
Are they all dead, divorced and threatened by the NFL and CBS Sports and by their own

2411
02:06:48,380 --> 02:06:51,640
parents never to talk about the greatest day in their lives?

2412
02:06:51,640 --> 02:06:53,880
Are they part of child trafficking?

2413
02:06:53,880 --> 02:06:57,860
Who would do this to fourth-grade children when we all know that children need to express

2414
02:06:57,860 --> 02:07:01,840
their feelings or emotions or it can have long-term mental health issues?

2415
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:06,100
Then below that is a YouTube link and then it says, please have your uncle verify and

2416
02:07:06,100 --> 02:07:13,320
tell me that I am not crazy because I have now run out of funds chasing the truth.

2417
02:07:13,320 --> 02:07:16,980
Please help if you can afford it, Wolfgang Halhut, and then he gives his address and

2418
02:07:16,980 --> 02:07:17,980
phone number.

2419
02:07:17,980 --> 02:07:18,980
Mm-hmm.

2420
02:07:18,980 --> 02:07:19,980
Correct?

2421
02:07:19,980 --> 02:07:20,980
I've read all that correctly?

2422
02:07:20,980 --> 02:07:21,980
Yes.

2423
02:07:21,980 --> 02:07:25,820
If you can trust them to verify that he is not crazy, that's not something that could

2424
02:07:25,820 --> 02:07:26,820
be done from this email.

2425
02:07:26,820 --> 02:07:29,260
This is crazy, isn't it?

2426
02:07:29,260 --> 02:07:32,660
That is when I really started thinking that it probably did happen when things took these

2427
02:07:32,660 --> 02:07:33,900
turns, yes.

2428
02:07:33,900 --> 02:07:40,020
But then I still saw some anomalies, but I'm not the progenitor of this.

2429
02:07:40,020 --> 02:07:41,020
I'm not saying this.

2430
02:07:41,020 --> 02:07:42,020
No, I understand that.

2431
02:07:42,020 --> 02:07:46,900
But once you see this, you have to understand that Wolfgang Halhut isn't reliable anymore,

2432
02:07:46,900 --> 02:07:47,900
right?

2433
02:07:47,900 --> 02:07:48,900
Yes.

2434
02:07:48,900 --> 02:07:51,460
When he first came out, though, I'd seen him on national TV as a big top expert and

2435
02:07:51,460 --> 02:07:53,740
a couple of things, so that's why I was relying on him.

2436
02:07:53,740 --> 02:07:54,740
Yeah.

2437
02:07:54,740 --> 02:07:55,740
Okay.

2438
02:07:55,740 --> 02:07:58,940
So this is an important foundation here that's being built through this email because it

2439
02:07:58,940 --> 02:08:02,900
kind of boxes Alex in, and honestly, he did it to himself.

2440
02:08:02,900 --> 02:08:07,140
Because he's getting presented with a clearly insane email that Halbig sent Rob to trying

2441
02:08:07,140 --> 02:08:12,300
to reach Rob's uncle, Alex has to say that it's not coming from a credible person, but

2442
02:08:12,300 --> 02:08:16,460
he also has to maintain that it wasn't wrong for him to have seen Halbig as a credible

2443
02:08:16,460 --> 02:08:18,580
source prior to this.

2444
02:08:18,580 --> 02:08:22,900
That's why Alex tries to use this excuse that it was actually, this was when he decided

2445
02:08:22,900 --> 02:08:26,500
that Halbig wasn't a good source and that he shouldn't listen to him.

2446
02:08:26,500 --> 02:08:30,820
This is a really dumb piece of information to Alex's offer up, essentially unprompted

2447
02:08:30,820 --> 02:08:35,140
because what it does is it puts a hard deadline on the point where you yourself are admitting

2448
02:08:35,140 --> 02:08:38,340
you had no reason to take this person's claim seriously.

2449
02:08:38,340 --> 02:08:39,340
Yeah.

2450
02:08:39,340 --> 02:08:43,340
This is basically creating an unanswerable question for Alex if you can demonstrate that

2451
02:08:43,340 --> 02:08:48,480
he took Halbig's claim seriously at any point after this, and that's a real problem for

2452
02:08:48,480 --> 02:08:50,980
Alex's appearance of consistency.

2453
02:08:50,980 --> 02:08:54,680
This is also a double edged sword because Alex is also essentially testifying that the

2454
02:08:54,680 --> 02:08:59,300
things that Halbig did or sent Infowars prior to this were not enough to get him to think

2455
02:08:59,300 --> 02:09:02,380
that Halbig was nuts and shouldn't be trusted as a source.

2456
02:09:02,380 --> 02:09:03,660
So remember the date of this.

2457
02:09:03,660 --> 02:09:07,020
This was November 19th, 2016 was when this happened.

2458
02:09:07,020 --> 02:09:12,040
Yeah, I mean, that's one where you really, that's an own goal.

2459
02:09:12,040 --> 02:09:16,360
That should be, that's on Alex right there, because the moment you are like given the

2460
02:09:16,360 --> 02:09:23,500
opportunity to have a date stamp on something you think and you're Alex, that's not a good

2461
02:09:23,500 --> 02:09:24,500
idea.

2462
02:09:24,500 --> 02:09:27,660
Well, again, it's that, it's that thing we talk about a bit and that's the like specificity

2463
02:09:27,660 --> 02:09:33,700
is a real danger when you're giving this, whether it's that exact date of the email

2464
02:09:33,700 --> 02:09:39,600
or this time that this, this story was being pushed by Halbig, that is too specific for

2465
02:09:39,600 --> 02:09:41,700
you to be able to play games with.

2466
02:09:41,700 --> 02:09:42,700
You can't have that.

2467
02:09:42,700 --> 02:09:49,220
Which again, if I'm doing this, I would say look into when I actually started listening

2468
02:09:49,220 --> 02:09:52,340
to Halbig and when I stopped talking about Halbig.

2469
02:09:52,340 --> 02:09:53,340
You might not want to do that.

2470
02:09:53,340 --> 02:09:54,340
It would feel bad.

2471
02:09:54,340 --> 02:09:59,260
And I would not, not agree to a date prior to the end of when I started talking about

2472
02:09:59,260 --> 02:10:00,260
Halbig.

2473
02:10:00,260 --> 02:10:04,180
But what's fascinating about it too is if you listen to it, he's not agreeing to something.

2474
02:10:04,180 --> 02:10:05,540
He's saying it himself.

2475
02:10:05,540 --> 02:10:06,540
Yep.

2476
02:10:06,540 --> 02:10:09,940
That is not a question that Mark asked him at all, which is wild.

2477
02:10:09,940 --> 02:10:10,940
Amazing.

2478
02:10:10,940 --> 02:10:14,980
There's a long chunk that I skip over here because the, between the last clip and the

2479
02:10:14,980 --> 02:10:20,260
next one, and it's not because the stuff wasn't interesting, but because it's not really relevant

2480
02:10:20,260 --> 02:10:22,500
to some of the questions we have.

2481
02:10:22,500 --> 02:10:26,020
It consists of Mark and Alex discussing how the alternative media is really important

2482
02:10:26,020 --> 02:10:29,580
in the country because the corporate media isn't really something that we can trust to

2483
02:10:29,580 --> 02:10:31,180
get us out of the mess we're in.

2484
02:10:31,180 --> 02:10:35,740
Mark keeps trying to work in a recognition that it's important for the alternative media

2485
02:10:35,740 --> 02:10:38,380
to hold themselves responsible when they get things wrong.

2486
02:10:38,380 --> 02:10:41,540
And then Alex just goes off about how he's the victim and the mainstream media's out

2487
02:10:41,540 --> 02:10:43,260
to crush all alternative media.

2488
02:10:43,260 --> 02:10:44,260
Sure.

2489
02:10:44,260 --> 02:10:47,420
It's a bit of a circular thing, but it seems like the goal is to try and attempt to build

2490
02:10:47,420 --> 02:10:48,780
some rapport.

2491
02:10:48,780 --> 02:10:52,940
That has the effect of possibly confusing Alex and getting him off his set plans, and

2492
02:10:52,940 --> 02:10:57,460
it also makes it so the kinds of rebuttals can't really be used effectively.

2493
02:10:57,460 --> 02:11:01,180
Alex can't excuse his behavior by condemning the mainstream media because Mark can just

2494
02:11:01,180 --> 02:11:04,020
say, you're telling me, man, but that's not what we were here to talk about.

2495
02:11:04,020 --> 02:11:10,580
So it's, again, just sort of creating that camaraderie almost.

2496
02:11:10,580 --> 02:11:16,860
I find it interesting that Alex is such a weird dude that you can play both good cop

2497
02:11:16,860 --> 02:11:21,740
and bad cop in the same deposition.

2498
02:11:21,740 --> 02:11:29,460
He's fucking pinned Alex's ears to the wall, and Alex is still like, yeah, no, you don't

2499
02:11:29,460 --> 02:11:30,460
like the mainstream media?

2500
02:11:30,460 --> 02:11:31,460
Me neither, man.

2501
02:11:31,460 --> 02:11:34,380
I think we got a lot of common ground here.

2502
02:11:34,380 --> 02:11:38,620
It is weird to hear, like, there's a bit of guard letting down, and it's like, you have

2503
02:11:38,620 --> 02:11:41,460
to know that this isn't for your benefit.

2504
02:11:41,460 --> 02:11:45,620
You've got fucking railroad spikes through the stigmata, man.

2505
02:11:45,620 --> 02:11:46,620
You're fucked, okay?

2506
02:11:46,620 --> 02:11:47,620
Yeah.

2507
02:11:47,620 --> 02:11:52,780
So there's a bit of that, and then another email from Wolfgang Halbig is brought up.

2508
02:11:52,780 --> 02:11:55,020
I want to show you this.

2509
02:11:55,020 --> 02:11:58,460
This I've marked as exhibit 13.

2510
02:11:58,460 --> 02:12:02,940
Okay.

2511
02:12:02,940 --> 02:12:07,940
This as you see at the bottom, it says FSSTX-039550.

2512
02:12:07,940 --> 02:12:08,940
Yes.

2513
02:12:08,940 --> 02:12:09,940
Okay.

2514
02:12:09,940 --> 02:12:12,740
And this is from Wolfgang Halbig, right?

2515
02:12:12,740 --> 02:12:13,740
Yes.

2516
02:12:13,740 --> 02:12:14,740
Okay.

2517
02:12:14,740 --> 02:12:17,500
And then this is two, a couple email addresses that I bet you don't know who those people

2518
02:12:17,500 --> 02:12:18,500
are, right?

2519
02:12:18,500 --> 02:12:20,500
No, I don't.

2520
02:12:20,500 --> 02:12:21,500
Yeah.

2521
02:12:21,500 --> 02:12:23,500
The one is safensoundschools.org.

2522
02:12:23,500 --> 02:12:25,700
Have you ever heard of an organization called that?

2523
02:12:25,700 --> 02:12:26,700
Not in my memory.

2524
02:12:26,700 --> 02:12:27,700
I don't either.

2525
02:12:27,700 --> 02:12:28,700
Okay.

2526
02:12:28,700 --> 02:12:29,700
Okay.

2527
02:12:29,700 --> 02:12:33,540
I'm going to assume, though, that you see the address is written to somebody named Michelle?

2528
02:12:33,540 --> 02:12:34,540
Yes.

2529
02:12:34,540 --> 02:12:35,540
Okay.

2530
02:12:35,540 --> 02:12:41,660
And then the subject line is, I urge Michelle to stop using Josephine in making money and

2531
02:12:41,660 --> 02:12:44,940
appearing on speaking engagements.

2532
02:12:44,940 --> 02:12:45,940
You saw that?

2533
02:12:45,940 --> 02:12:46,940
Yes.

2534
02:12:46,940 --> 02:12:47,940
Okay.

2535
02:12:47,940 --> 02:12:48,940
The date of this email is December 21st, 2014?

2536
02:12:48,940 --> 02:12:49,940
Yes.

2537
02:12:49,940 --> 02:12:50,940
Okay.

2538
02:12:50,940 --> 02:12:53,740
And as we see from free speech systems at the bottom, this is a document from Infowars

2539
02:12:53,740 --> 02:12:54,740
Corporate Files.

2540
02:12:54,740 --> 02:12:55,740
Correct?

2541
02:12:55,740 --> 02:12:56,740
Okay.

2542
02:12:56,740 --> 02:12:59,740
And the attachments here, we see a bunch of PNGs, if that's correct?

2543
02:12:59,740 --> 02:13:00,740
Yes.

2544
02:13:00,740 --> 02:13:01,740
Okay.

2545
02:13:01,740 --> 02:13:03,540
I'm going to go ahead and read the email to you, all right?

2546
02:13:03,540 --> 02:13:07,600
So this is another email from Halbig, and you'll notice that this one's dated prior

2547
02:13:07,600 --> 02:13:11,180
to the one about the Super Bowl Choir, which is where Alex has claimed that he realized

2548
02:13:11,180 --> 02:13:12,500
Halbig is no good.

2549
02:13:12,500 --> 02:13:13,500
Right.

2550
02:13:13,500 --> 02:13:17,380
So this email was in Infowars Corporate Files, which itself is weird, because no one at Infowars

2551
02:13:17,380 --> 02:13:20,140
seems to be copied on this email itself.

2552
02:13:20,140 --> 02:13:21,220
It's very weird.

2553
02:13:21,220 --> 02:13:26,100
Its existence in the files implies an awareness of its contents, since it wasn't emailed to

2554
02:13:26,100 --> 02:13:27,100
him.

2555
02:13:27,100 --> 02:13:28,100
Yeah.

2556
02:13:28,100 --> 02:13:31,340
So this wasn't good enough to get Halbig blacklisted, and this is a mess.

2557
02:13:31,340 --> 02:13:35,860
I'm going to go ahead and read the email to you, all right?

2558
02:13:35,860 --> 02:13:40,260
Michelle, how could you and your husband as responsible parents even allow your precious

2559
02:13:40,260 --> 02:13:45,540
child Josephine to attend that filthy and deplorable looking school on December 14th,

2560
02:13:45,540 --> 02:13:46,540
2012?

2561
02:13:46,540 --> 02:13:52,660
This school, as you must have known, is and was a toxic waste dump as reported by environmental

2562
02:13:52,660 --> 02:13:57,060
consultants who requested more money from City of Newtown leaders before demolishing

2563
02:13:57,060 --> 02:14:02,340
the school and transported all of the high levels of lead paint, high levels of asbestos,

2564
02:14:02,340 --> 02:14:07,380
and especially the high levels of PCPs in the groundwater at Sandy Hook out of state.

2565
02:14:07,380 --> 02:14:11,220
Josephine, your child should have expected more from you before that tragic day as a

2566
02:14:11,220 --> 02:14:12,220
parent.

2567
02:14:12,220 --> 02:14:15,840
You are supposed to protect her from serious lifelong health risk when you send her to

2568
02:14:15,840 --> 02:14:17,480
that school every day.

2569
02:14:17,480 --> 02:14:21,460
Why would you, as a parent, and all those other parents who supposedly lost a child

2570
02:14:21,460 --> 02:14:26,660
to gunfire, allow their children, as you did, to serious toxic waste?

2571
02:14:26,660 --> 02:14:30,980
This all unfolded before the first shot at that school even occurred.

2572
02:14:30,980 --> 02:14:36,300
Did you not see the filth and deplorable conditions when you went to that school, or are you blind?

2573
02:14:36,300 --> 02:14:41,260
I do not understand unless you explain it to me and the world why you and your husband

2574
02:14:41,260 --> 02:14:45,700
failed Josephine, who is a nonverbal child, as you stated and depended on her safety.

2575
02:14:45,700 --> 02:14:46,700
Oh, that was a big sigh.

2576
02:14:46,700 --> 02:14:47,700
That was a big sigh.

2577
02:14:47,700 --> 02:14:51,620
You could protect her from all the serious health risks that you sentenced her to on

2578
02:14:51,620 --> 02:14:53,160
a daily basis.

2579
02:14:53,160 --> 02:14:55,060
Now you talk about school security.

2580
02:14:55,060 --> 02:14:56,780
You have got to be joking.

2581
02:14:56,780 --> 02:15:00,740
You have all these experts on your staff who are now part of your conspiracy.

2582
02:15:00,740 --> 02:15:03,500
They should be ashamed of their actions in supporting you.

2583
02:15:03,500 --> 02:15:09,100
A mom puts her own child at risk on a daily basis and is now the expert on school security?

2584
02:15:09,100 --> 02:15:14,420
I look forward to meeting you one day when I can take your deposition about not about

2585
02:15:14,420 --> 02:15:19,260
the shooting, but why you and your husband failed Josephine by sending her to that filthy

2586
02:15:19,260 --> 02:15:22,420
and deplorable school with all that toxic waste.

2587
02:15:22,420 --> 02:15:26,980
We call this child endangerment when you know of the danger that exposes your child to serious

2588
02:15:26,980 --> 02:15:28,820
lifelong health risk.

2589
02:15:28,820 --> 02:15:33,060
You must have known without a doubt because pictures do not, and it says ally, but I believe

2590
02:15:33,060 --> 02:15:35,460
that means lie.

2591
02:15:35,460 --> 02:15:40,860
You put her life in serious risk every day knowing how filthy and deplorable that school

2592
02:15:40,860 --> 02:15:41,860
is.

2593
02:15:41,860 --> 02:15:46,100
You are enclosing photos that you must recognize since you took your child to school and having

2594
02:15:46,100 --> 02:15:50,520
a child in special needs, you would expect a school environment and school climate that

2595
02:15:50,520 --> 02:15:53,900
allows children to learn and teachers to teach, right?

2596
02:15:53,900 --> 02:15:58,660
Please explain to me if you can why a school principal Dawn Hopspring would allow her school

2597
02:15:58,660 --> 02:16:01,060
to be so filthy and deplorable looking.

2598
02:16:01,060 --> 02:16:05,060
There is not one female elementary school principal in this country who would allow

2599
02:16:05,060 --> 02:16:09,780
her school to be that filthy and deplorable both inside and outside and most of all allow

2600
02:16:09,780 --> 02:16:15,420
her to become a toxic waste dump placing every child in her needs to work on brevity, lifelong

2601
02:16:15,420 --> 02:16:17,220
health risk, right?

2602
02:16:17,220 --> 02:16:21,540
All the pictures are taken by the major crime squad from the Connecticut State Police.

2603
02:16:21,540 --> 02:16:24,940
Please respond since you are now the expert on school security.

2604
02:16:24,940 --> 02:16:30,660
Wolfgang W. How big www.sandyjustice, sandyhookjustice.com I read that correctly.

2605
02:16:30,660 --> 02:16:31,660
Yes.

2606
02:16:31,660 --> 02:16:33,660
How you feel about that anymore?

2607
02:16:33,660 --> 02:16:34,940
It's horrible.

2608
02:16:34,940 --> 02:16:36,420
I've never seen this before.

2609
02:16:36,420 --> 02:16:39,900
I mean, I guess he sent it to us too.

2610
02:16:39,900 --> 02:16:41,820
Oh, it's in, in what was corporate files, right?

2611
02:16:41,820 --> 02:16:44,460
Yeah, I just don't, I don't even see him for words on here though.

2612
02:16:44,460 --> 02:16:45,460
I'm wondering why we had it.

2613
02:16:45,460 --> 02:16:46,460
That's all right.

2614
02:16:46,460 --> 02:16:47,460
That was going to be my next question.

2615
02:16:47,460 --> 02:16:48,460
Do you know?

2616
02:16:48,460 --> 02:16:49,460
I don't.

2617
02:16:49,460 --> 02:16:50,460
Okay.

2618
02:16:50,460 --> 02:16:54,660
So this is an email where how big is harassing and terrorizing the Sandy Hook family.

2619
02:16:54,660 --> 02:16:59,100
Uh, this was before the point where Alex said he'd realized that how big was bad news and

2620
02:16:59,100 --> 02:17:00,100
this looks bad.

2621
02:17:00,100 --> 02:17:01,100
Yeah.

2622
02:17:01,100 --> 02:17:04,180
And see, some of these clips are a little bit longer where Mark's reading these emails.

2623
02:17:04,180 --> 02:17:09,460
I think that it's important because it honestly was kind of a revelation for me too, because

2624
02:17:09,460 --> 02:17:15,100
I understood that, you know, how big's behavior was characterized this way, but I hadn't heard

2625
02:17:15,100 --> 02:17:20,900
the contents of these emails and it really, it really did make me, uh, and not like take

2626
02:17:20,900 --> 02:17:25,340
it more seriously or anything cause I already, already felt this was a pretty serious, serious

2627
02:17:25,340 --> 02:17:27,660
case, but it, it's personal.

2628
02:17:27,660 --> 02:17:34,160
It made it more visceral and knowing the actual behavior and the, the ways that he's contacted

2629
02:17:34,160 --> 02:17:38,780
these family members and that the things that he's doing simultaneously to the time when

2630
02:17:38,780 --> 02:17:45,940
Alex is promoting him and such, it really just gets pretty inexcusable, pretty disgusting.

2631
02:17:45,940 --> 02:17:52,340
I've got a new rule for my life, which is that I don't want to be around people who

2632
02:17:52,340 --> 02:17:58,720
if I were to have their emails read to me in a deposition are both so awful I would

2633
02:17:58,720 --> 02:18:05,180
have to sigh and put my head in my hands, but also so long that I have to do it multiple

2634
02:18:05,180 --> 02:18:06,180
times.

2635
02:18:06,180 --> 02:18:07,180
Yeah, there were a bunch of sighs in there.

2636
02:18:07,180 --> 02:18:13,140
That is, that was the most like, oh fuck, like you could not get more opportunities

2637
02:18:13,140 --> 02:18:20,500
for one man to say, oh fuck, oh that was a bad one, oh Jesus, is there more?

2638
02:18:20,500 --> 02:18:21,500
There's more.

2639
02:18:21,500 --> 02:18:22,500
There is more.

2640
02:18:22,500 --> 02:18:23,500
Holy fuck.

2641
02:18:23,500 --> 02:18:24,500
And guess what?

2642
02:18:24,500 --> 02:18:25,500
There's another email.

2643
02:18:25,500 --> 02:18:26,500
No!

2644
02:18:26,500 --> 02:18:27,500
Yes!

2645
02:18:27,500 --> 02:18:28,500
Jesus!

2646
02:18:28,500 --> 02:18:29,500
Yes!

2647
02:18:29,500 --> 02:18:30,500
Yes!

2648
02:18:30,500 --> 02:18:31,500
Is it 14?

2649
02:18:31,500 --> 02:18:34,180
You see at the top there's another email from Wolfgang Halbig.

2650
02:18:34,180 --> 02:18:35,180
Yes.

2651
02:18:35,180 --> 02:18:36,180
Right?

2652
02:18:36,180 --> 02:18:40,580
And then this one, let me see here.

2653
02:18:40,580 --> 02:18:41,580
You see about right here?

2654
02:18:41,580 --> 02:18:42,580
Yep.

2655
02:18:42,580 --> 02:18:43,580
See how blue the line is?

2656
02:18:43,580 --> 02:18:44,580
Oh.

2657
02:18:44,580 --> 02:18:45,580
So you're good.

2658
02:18:45,580 --> 02:18:46,580
You see that?

2659
02:18:46,580 --> 02:18:47,580
And so you see on your document too?

2660
02:18:47,580 --> 02:18:48,580
Yes.

2661
02:18:48,580 --> 02:18:49,820
You've got some Infowars email addresses there?

2662
02:18:49,820 --> 02:18:50,820
Yes.

2663
02:18:50,820 --> 02:18:51,820
Okay.

2664
02:18:51,820 --> 02:18:53,540
And that would be Rob Dew and Nico who got this email?

2665
02:18:53,540 --> 02:18:54,540
Yes.

2666
02:18:54,540 --> 02:18:55,540
Okay.

2667
02:18:55,540 --> 02:18:57,540
This was March 21st, 2017?

2668
02:18:57,540 --> 02:18:58,540
Yes.

2669
02:18:58,540 --> 02:18:59,540
Okay.

2670
02:18:59,540 --> 02:19:04,860
The subject was, anyone needing the address for a visit to welcome them to Florida, please

2671
02:19:04,860 --> 02:19:07,420
call and this was a great day for me.

2672
02:19:07,420 --> 02:19:10,340
Who says that you cannot catch a big fish in Florida?

2673
02:19:10,340 --> 02:19:12,660
That's what the subject line says?

2674
02:19:12,660 --> 02:19:13,660
Yes.

2675
02:19:13,660 --> 02:19:14,660
Okay.

2676
02:19:14,660 --> 02:19:17,260
And then there's a PNG attached, an image file?

2677
02:19:17,260 --> 02:19:18,900
Is that correct?

2678
02:19:18,900 --> 02:19:19,900
Yes.

2679
02:19:19,900 --> 02:19:20,900
Okay.

2680
02:19:20,900 --> 02:19:22,020
And then I'm going to go ahead and read this email to you.

2681
02:19:22,020 --> 02:19:26,980
So here we have another email from Halbig and the date on this one is March 21st, 2017.

2682
02:19:26,980 --> 02:19:30,260
So as we can tell from Alex's telling of the timeline, this is supposed to be after he'd

2683
02:19:30,260 --> 02:19:33,700
realized that Halbig was not a good source.

2684
02:19:33,700 --> 02:19:36,100
Possibly a content warning, this email is very disturbing.

2685
02:19:36,100 --> 02:19:39,660
I found it a bit chilling to hear and I don't want to just spring this on people without

2686
02:19:39,660 --> 02:19:40,740
a little bit of a heads up.

2687
02:19:40,740 --> 02:19:44,300
It's not like explicit or anything but it's fucked up.

2688
02:19:44,300 --> 02:19:46,300
Real messed up.

2689
02:19:46,300 --> 02:19:49,580
And then I'm going to go ahead and read this email to you.

2690
02:19:49,580 --> 02:19:55,500
It says Nick and Laura Phelps did a great job acting in Newtown, Connecticut on December

2691
02:19:55,500 --> 02:19:57,140
14th, 2012.

2692
02:19:57,140 --> 02:20:05,220
I visited their home today at 1924 Westover Reserve Boulevard, Windmere, Florida, 34786.

2693
02:20:05,220 --> 02:20:09,740
And thanks to Lieutenant Vangaly telling me during my wellness check of Nick and Laura

2694
02:20:09,740 --> 02:20:14,620
Phelps that they no longer live in Newtown, Connecticut and that they are now, and they

2695
02:20:14,620 --> 02:20:17,620
are now Richard and Jennifer Sexton.

2696
02:20:17,620 --> 02:20:18,620
Guess what?

2697
02:20:18,620 --> 02:20:19,700
He is totally right.

2698
02:20:19,700 --> 02:20:24,420
And can you believe it that my Newtown police department guided me in the right direction?

2699
02:20:24,420 --> 02:20:28,100
They have a beautiful home with a three car garage.

2700
02:20:28,100 --> 02:20:33,080
They were not home today, but the good news was that the three adult female moms with

2701
02:20:33,080 --> 02:20:37,140
their children standing outside their homes observed me and wanted to know what I was

2702
02:20:37,140 --> 02:20:38,520
doing.

2703
02:20:38,520 --> 02:20:39,600
It was spring break.

2704
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:42,660
It is spring break for Orange County, Florida school children.

2705
02:20:42,660 --> 02:20:46,180
I showed them this picture and I told them that I did not want to go to the wrong house

2706
02:20:46,180 --> 02:20:52,460
to surprise Nick and Laura from Newtown, Connecticut, aka Richard and Jennifer Sexton today.

2707
02:20:52,460 --> 02:20:56,100
It took a few minutes for them to look at the pictures and then when they asked why

2708
02:20:56,100 --> 02:21:00,420
I wanted to speak to them, I told them that I had been in Newtown and wanted to surprise

2709
02:21:00,420 --> 02:21:02,660
them since they now live in Florida.

2710
02:21:02,660 --> 02:21:06,040
They asked for my name, which I gave them as Wolfgang Halbig.

2711
02:21:06,040 --> 02:21:09,660
They told me how I would know them, knew them, and I told them that they have, they have

2712
02:21:09,660 --> 02:21:13,780
been on the national news, so I wanted to meet them again.

2713
02:21:13,780 --> 02:21:16,460
Our conversation was all about Newtown, Connecticut.

2714
02:21:16,460 --> 02:21:18,560
So she said, do you mind if I text her?

2715
02:21:18,560 --> 02:21:20,560
I said, absolutely not.

2716
02:21:20,560 --> 02:21:25,460
Waited about 10 minutes only to learn that they did not know me, which surprised me.

2717
02:21:25,460 --> 02:21:29,900
They verified the pictures and why would she text them about Newtown, Connecticut and that

2718
02:21:29,900 --> 02:21:34,780
someone from there wanted to visit if they had, if they were not Nick and Laura Phelps

2719
02:21:34,780 --> 02:21:37,500
now, Richard and Jennifer Sexton.

2720
02:21:37,500 --> 02:21:41,860
At first I did not want to enter since it is a gated community, but several people told

2721
02:21:41,860 --> 02:21:43,100
me just go on in there.

2722
02:21:43,100 --> 02:21:45,460
There is no security guard at the gates.

2723
02:21:45,460 --> 02:21:50,220
If there is CCTV, they will see me being told to go in and that is the only reason or I

2724
02:21:50,220 --> 02:21:51,900
would not have entered.

2725
02:21:51,900 --> 02:21:54,900
Now who says law enforcement does not know what they are doing?

2726
02:21:54,900 --> 02:21:57,540
Thank you, Newtown, Connecticut police department.

2727
02:21:57,540 --> 02:22:01,660
Can you turn the document over?

2728
02:22:01,660 --> 02:22:03,220
First of all, read that email correctly?

2729
02:22:03,220 --> 02:22:04,220
Yes.

2730
02:22:04,220 --> 02:22:05,220
Okay.

2731
02:22:05,220 --> 02:22:06,220
And then on the back you see there's a picture here, right?

2732
02:22:06,220 --> 02:22:07,220
Yes.

2733
02:22:07,220 --> 02:22:10,220
And at the top it says Sandy Hook hoax actors, correct?

2734
02:22:10,220 --> 02:22:11,220
Yes.

2735
02:22:11,220 --> 02:22:13,220
And it has arrows pointing to the Phelps, right?

2736
02:22:13,220 --> 02:22:14,220
Yes.

2737
02:22:14,220 --> 02:22:17,220
And then at the bottom it says playing the part of grief stricken parents, correct?

2738
02:22:17,220 --> 02:22:18,220
Yes.

2739
02:22:18,220 --> 02:22:21,140
This is a horrible email, isn't it?

2740
02:22:21,140 --> 02:22:26,580
I've never seen this email and it's, yes, I don't like this email.

2741
02:22:26,580 --> 02:22:30,300
And again, this is someone else, Wolfgang Halbig after I'd already clearly knew that

2742
02:22:30,300 --> 02:22:31,380
he cracked up.

2743
02:22:31,380 --> 02:22:33,620
And so that's, that's, that's not my work.

2744
02:22:33,620 --> 02:22:34,620
So that sucks.

2745
02:22:34,620 --> 02:22:37,380
Uh, just a dude bragging about stalking grieving families.

2746
02:22:37,380 --> 02:22:43,060
I mean, that's unbelievable psychopathic in a fucking serial killer.

2747
02:22:43,060 --> 02:22:44,060
That's a serial killer.

2748
02:22:44,060 --> 02:22:45,060
Yeah.

2749
02:22:45,060 --> 02:22:48,180
That should be treated with the same level of true crime terror as a serial killer.

2750
02:22:48,180 --> 02:22:49,180
Yeah.

2751
02:22:49,180 --> 02:22:50,180
Yeah.

2752
02:22:50,180 --> 02:22:52,940
It's, it's, uh, Holy fuck.

2753
02:22:52,940 --> 02:22:58,040
It's hard to imagine something more unsettling in the context of like what Wolfgang could

2754
02:22:58,040 --> 02:22:59,040
have been doing.

2755
02:22:59,040 --> 02:23:00,040
Yeah.

2756
02:23:00,040 --> 02:23:04,820
And in like, and like most true crime documentaries, the cops are the bad guys as all allegedly,

2757
02:23:04,820 --> 02:23:05,820
I don't know how much you take.

2758
02:23:05,820 --> 02:23:09,500
No, I'm not saying that he necessarily really accurate.

2759
02:23:09,500 --> 02:23:14,420
So at the end there you can see Alex essentially taking the bait that he set for himself.

2760
02:23:14,420 --> 02:23:18,700
He's established that he knew how big was no good after the super bowl thing in 2016.

2761
02:23:18,700 --> 02:23:22,140
And then after that, uh, this is this email, it comes from after that.

2762
02:23:22,140 --> 02:23:24,700
So, so he gets to absolve himself of any responsibility.

2763
02:23:24,700 --> 02:23:26,820
He gets to use this trick that he pulled out.

2764
02:23:26,820 --> 02:23:31,300
He would, but like I said, this is a trap that Alex set by giving a pretty specific

2765
02:23:31,300 --> 02:23:37,820
time period when he has no excuse to not know that how big isn't reliable and this immediately

2766
02:23:37,820 --> 02:23:38,820
becomes a problem.

2767
02:23:38,820 --> 02:23:39,820
Yeah.

2768
02:23:39,820 --> 02:23:40,820
Yes.

2769
02:23:40,820 --> 02:23:41,820
I don't like this email.

2770
02:23:41,820 --> 02:23:45,740
There's nothing else, Wolfgang Halbig after I'd already clearly knew that he cracked up.

2771
02:23:45,740 --> 02:23:47,980
And so that's, that's, that's not my work.

2772
02:23:47,980 --> 02:23:53,540
Next month you did a video called Sandy Hook vampires exposed, right?

2773
02:23:53,540 --> 02:23:55,580
Someone edited a video, put that name on it.

2774
02:23:55,580 --> 02:23:56,580
I've seen that.

2775
02:23:56,580 --> 02:23:57,580
Okay.

2776
02:23:57,580 --> 02:24:00,260
And during that video you repeated all of Wolfgang Halbig claims, right?

2777
02:24:00,260 --> 02:24:02,460
His 16 questions thing.

2778
02:24:02,460 --> 02:24:08,480
I don't remember, uh, that I'd have to see that video, but I believe it was about people

2779
02:24:08,480 --> 02:24:12,020
using it to continue to try to get gun control and money.

2780
02:24:12,020 --> 02:24:13,020
Nope.

2781
02:24:13,020 --> 02:24:20,260
Uh, so yeah, we have, we have a, uh, a demonstration and a point made that after this, even all,

2782
02:24:20,260 --> 02:24:24,620
all this, your timeline doesn't make sense, you know, after all this bullshit, the stocking

2783
02:24:24,620 --> 02:24:32,540
of families, uh, email, the horrifying emails being sent to Nico and Rob, like, and, uh,

2784
02:24:32,540 --> 02:24:38,420
after the 2016 point, when you had every reason to doubt his credibility as an expert, you're

2785
02:24:38,420 --> 02:24:41,860
still repeating his things in the Sandy Hook vampires video.

2786
02:24:41,860 --> 02:24:48,020
I can't believe he, that's, that's just dumb in every direction all the time.

2787
02:24:48,020 --> 02:24:52,080
It makes it so much easier to point to like, oh, okay, so at this point you're not supposed

2788
02:24:52,080 --> 02:24:53,080
to trust it, right?

2789
02:24:53,080 --> 02:24:54,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2790
02:24:54,080 --> 02:24:55,080
So explain this.

2791
02:24:55,080 --> 02:24:59,500
And again, just that, that like tiny glimmer of hope of, of just like, well, you know,

2792
02:24:59,500 --> 02:25:04,700
I haven't seen the video, dude, we're at our whenever of this.

2793
02:25:04,700 --> 02:25:10,100
If he says he's got a video of you saying it and you haven't seen the video, click,

2794
02:25:10,100 --> 02:25:11,740
you can play it at any time, man.

2795
02:25:11,740 --> 02:25:12,740
It's here.

2796
02:25:12,740 --> 02:25:13,740
Yeah.

2797
02:25:13,740 --> 02:25:16,820
And the, uh, the, I don't know, I haven't seen the video is only going to get you out

2798
02:25:16,820 --> 02:25:17,820
of answering this question.

2799
02:25:17,820 --> 02:25:18,820
Now.

2800
02:25:18,820 --> 02:25:19,820
It's not a good answer.

2801
02:25:19,820 --> 02:25:21,100
It's not a good excuse.

2802
02:25:21,100 --> 02:25:22,100
You're fucked.

2803
02:25:22,100 --> 02:25:23,660
So we've got another how big email.

2804
02:25:23,660 --> 02:25:25,020
Oh, God damn it.

2805
02:25:25,020 --> 02:25:26,020
Yeah.

2806
02:25:26,020 --> 02:25:27,020
This one's not great either.

2807
02:25:27,020 --> 02:25:31,220
I mean, I'm not even associated with him and I'm making the sounds that Alex is making.

2808
02:25:31,220 --> 02:25:36,460
Mr. Jones, I've had you would have marked as exhibit 15.

2809
02:25:36,460 --> 02:25:37,460
At the bottom.

2810
02:25:37,460 --> 02:25:41,980
We see it says F S X T X dash zero four zero zero two seven.

2811
02:25:41,980 --> 02:25:42,980
Yes.

2812
02:25:42,980 --> 02:25:44,460
So there's an email from enforce corporate files.

2813
02:25:44,460 --> 02:25:45,460
Yes.

2814
02:25:45,460 --> 02:25:46,460
Okay.

2815
02:25:46,460 --> 02:25:47,460
The top, it says Wolfgang.

2816
02:25:47,460 --> 02:25:48,460
How big, right?

2817
02:25:48,460 --> 02:25:49,460
That's who it's from.

2818
02:25:49,460 --> 02:25:50,460
Yes.

2819
02:25:50,460 --> 02:25:51,460
Okay.

2820
02:25:51,460 --> 02:25:53,820
It says two wild rose farm, 1740 at gmail.com.

2821
02:25:53,820 --> 02:25:54,820
Do you know who that is?

2822
02:25:54,820 --> 02:25:57,060
Uh, no, that's my client, Scarlett.

2823
02:25:57,060 --> 02:25:58,060
Okay.

2824
02:25:58,060 --> 02:26:03,380
And the subject line says, how could you as a mother stop and buy your special brand of

2825
02:26:03,380 --> 02:26:09,020
coffee on December 14th, 2012 when you heard as a mom that shots had been fired at the

2826
02:26:09,020 --> 02:26:11,140
Sandy Hook school.

2827
02:26:11,140 --> 02:26:12,140
You read that correctly?

2828
02:26:12,140 --> 02:26:13,140
Yes.

2829
02:26:13,140 --> 02:26:15,860
This is a March 10th, 2015 email.

2830
02:26:15,860 --> 02:26:16,860
Correct?

2831
02:26:16,860 --> 02:26:17,860
Yes.

2832
02:26:17,860 --> 02:26:23,100
He says in this email, Scarlett, it is just a matter of time and all that money you have

2833
02:26:23,100 --> 02:26:24,700
has to be returned.

2834
02:26:24,700 --> 02:26:29,540
How could you even stop to buy your coffee and you bought coffee for two other people?

2835
02:26:29,540 --> 02:26:31,420
What kind of mother does that?

2836
02:26:31,420 --> 02:26:36,100
Especially when you see on the news, tell everyone how you ran across that fire department

2837
02:26:36,100 --> 02:26:37,300
parking lot.

2838
02:26:37,300 --> 02:26:40,060
If you did, you would have spilled the coffee.

2839
02:26:40,060 --> 02:26:44,020
Do some serious soul searching because the scam is up.

2840
02:26:44,020 --> 02:26:45,460
Wolfgang and his phone number.

2841
02:26:45,460 --> 02:26:46,780
I read that correctly.

2842
02:26:46,780 --> 02:26:47,780
Yes.

2843
02:26:47,780 --> 02:26:48,780
Okay.

2844
02:26:48,780 --> 02:26:53,260
So at least an info wars had in its corporate info wars had received information that Mr

2845
02:26:53,260 --> 02:26:56,980
Halbig was harassing Ms. Lewis, correct?

2846
02:26:56,980 --> 02:26:58,060
We get millions of emails.

2847
02:26:58,060 --> 02:27:01,580
I've never, I'd never seen those up until the time of these lawsuits.

2848
02:27:01,580 --> 02:27:03,620
So I'm, I'm not Wolfgang Halbig.

2849
02:27:03,620 --> 02:27:04,620
I understand.

2850
02:27:04,620 --> 02:27:08,140
All I'm asking is info wars received that.

2851
02:27:08,140 --> 02:27:09,140
Yes.

2852
02:27:09,140 --> 02:27:10,140
Okay.

2853
02:27:10,140 --> 02:27:14,260
So now we have another email where Halbig is harassing the families of Sandy Hook victims

2854
02:27:14,260 --> 02:27:17,700
being in this emails in corporate files for, for enforce.

2855
02:27:17,700 --> 02:27:22,300
And this one's from March 10th, 2015, which is prior to the supposed cutoff of Alex thinking

2856
02:27:22,300 --> 02:27:23,780
how big is credible.

2857
02:27:23,780 --> 02:27:27,180
The picture starts to come into focus a little bit where you have how big demonstrating a

2858
02:27:27,180 --> 02:27:31,260
pattern of behavior that people at info wars had every reason to know about given their

2859
02:27:31,260 --> 02:27:37,460
access to these emails and Rob do a news director for the nightly news being copied on almost

2860
02:27:37,460 --> 02:27:38,460
all of them.

2861
02:27:38,460 --> 02:27:39,460
Yep.

2862
02:27:39,460 --> 02:27:42,900
Also, this doesn't come up in the deposition, but Wolfgang Halbig was a guest on Alex's

2863
02:27:42,900 --> 02:27:49,420
show on March 4th, 2015, just six days before he wrote this email harassing Scarlett Lewis.

2864
02:27:49,420 --> 02:27:56,140
And like, it's not hard to put some pieces together of Wolfgang is on Alex's show, the

2865
02:27:56,140 --> 02:27:58,780
website, his website's given out.

2866
02:27:58,780 --> 02:28:04,680
It's conceivable that donations are, are accrued by his appearance on here and days later he's

2867
02:28:04,680 --> 02:28:08,340
engaging in this behavior where he harasses grieving parents.

2868
02:28:08,340 --> 02:28:09,340
It's disgusting.

2869
02:28:09,340 --> 02:28:10,340
Yeah.

2870
02:28:10,340 --> 02:28:11,340
Yeah.

2871
02:28:11,340 --> 02:28:15,500
If I'm Alex in this situation, I hear those three emails and I immediately switch tactics

2872
02:28:15,500 --> 02:28:18,180
and I just go, that guy's a real piece of shit.

2873
02:28:18,180 --> 02:28:19,180
We got to go get him.

2874
02:28:19,180 --> 02:28:22,460
And then I'd grab everybody and we'd go to Newtown, Connecticut or whatever it is we

2875
02:28:22,460 --> 02:28:23,460
need to go.

2876
02:28:23,460 --> 02:28:24,460
We're in Texas.

2877
02:28:24,460 --> 02:28:25,460
We got to get him.

2878
02:28:25,460 --> 02:28:26,460
Let's go.

2879
02:28:26,460 --> 02:28:27,460
We're in Texas.

2880
02:28:27,460 --> 02:28:28,460
Let's form a posse.

2881
02:28:28,460 --> 02:28:29,460
Let's get a posse together.

2882
02:28:29,460 --> 02:28:30,460
We got to get this guy.

2883
02:28:30,460 --> 02:28:31,460
He's a real piece of shit.

2884
02:28:31,460 --> 02:28:32,460
Mark, you're deputized.

2885
02:28:32,460 --> 02:28:33,460
Let's do this.

2886
02:28:33,460 --> 02:28:34,460
Everybody has guns now.

2887
02:28:34,460 --> 02:28:35,460
Cause I'm Alex.

2888
02:28:35,460 --> 02:28:37,460
Brad, get my horse.

2889
02:28:37,460 --> 02:28:38,900
Jesus.

2890
02:28:38,900 --> 02:28:39,900
What a piece of shit.

2891
02:28:39,900 --> 02:28:40,900
Yeah.

2892
02:28:40,900 --> 02:28:41,900
Fuck me.

2893
02:28:41,900 --> 02:28:42,900
Yeah.

2894
02:28:42,900 --> 02:28:45,020
That's a fucked up fucking wow.

2895
02:28:45,020 --> 02:28:46,020
Yeah.

2896
02:28:46,020 --> 02:28:54,460
So it's also interesting to recognize that these evasions of, I didn't know about this

2897
02:28:54,460 --> 02:28:55,460
stuff.

2898
02:28:55,460 --> 02:28:56,460
No one knew about this stuff.

2899
02:28:56,460 --> 02:28:57,460
We get so many emails.

2900
02:28:57,460 --> 02:28:59,740
It just doesn't really fly.

2901
02:28:59,740 --> 02:29:05,860
I'm going to show you what I've marked as exhibit 18.

2902
02:29:05,860 --> 02:29:11,260
You see at the bottom is FSSTX-039897.

2903
02:29:11,260 --> 02:29:12,260
Yes.

2904
02:29:12,260 --> 02:29:13,260
Okay.

2905
02:29:13,260 --> 02:29:16,540
So this is a 2015 email sent March 6th, 2015.

2906
02:29:16,540 --> 02:29:17,540
Yes.

2907
02:29:17,540 --> 02:29:18,540
Okay.

2908
02:29:18,540 --> 02:29:24,140
And this is, um, the top email is Nico forwarding something to Rob Dew.

2909
02:29:24,140 --> 02:29:25,140
Correct.

2910
02:29:25,140 --> 02:29:28,500
And it says forward two cents from a third year law student.

2911
02:29:28,500 --> 02:29:29,500
Right.

2912
02:29:29,500 --> 02:29:30,500
Yes.

2913
02:29:30,500 --> 02:29:34,340
And then it says some comments on how big's last interview from a law student.

2914
02:29:34,340 --> 02:29:35,340
Okay.

2915
02:29:35,340 --> 02:29:41,020
And then I'm going to go ahead and redo this email from a gentleman named R Darren Brumfield.

2916
02:29:41,020 --> 02:29:44,880
Who was sent to media contacts at info wars.com.

2917
02:29:44,880 --> 02:29:50,940
He writes two cents from a third year law student, Madam or sir, I'm in my final semester

2918
02:29:50,940 --> 02:29:51,940
of law school.

2919
02:29:51,940 --> 02:29:53,140
I listened to the Wolfgang.

2920
02:29:53,140 --> 02:29:56,420
How big video and some significant alarm bells went off.

2921
02:29:56,420 --> 02:30:00,060
I also wrote on the YouTube page, but I copy and paste here.

2922
02:30:00,060 --> 02:30:01,060
Okay.

2923
02:30:01,060 --> 02:30:06,020
So let's, so I just get this straight starting at 31 30, he filed his lawsuit in Seminole

2924
02:30:06,020 --> 02:30:10,820
County court in Florida, not in federal court in Florida, but in state court.

2925
02:30:10,820 --> 02:30:13,900
There is a legal requirement called quote standing unquote.

2926
02:30:13,900 --> 02:30:16,580
He does not have standing to Sue in Seminole County court.

2927
02:30:16,580 --> 02:30:19,180
He was not a party in the shooting in any fashion.

2928
02:30:19,180 --> 02:30:24,220
There is also a concept called quote jurisdiction unquote either the man is lying or the judge

2929
02:30:24,220 --> 02:30:25,220
is insane.

2930
02:30:25,220 --> 02:30:29,900
A Florida County level judge would not have jurisdiction for any reason other than a contract

2931
02:30:29,900 --> 02:30:35,980
tort or crime issue in directly involving how big something is completely wrong here.

2932
02:30:35,980 --> 02:30:41,020
Had he said, quote in the federal district of Florida, quote or whatever district it

2933
02:30:41,020 --> 02:30:42,020
might be.

2934
02:30:42,020 --> 02:30:45,140
If the state is split, that may at least be plausible.

2935
02:30:45,140 --> 02:30:49,580
This is completely insane and cannot go anywhere but into the trashcan.

2936
02:30:49,580 --> 02:30:54,120
No standing, no subject matter jurisdiction, no personal jurisdiction, two cents from a

2937
02:30:54,120 --> 02:30:59,860
third year law student who is legally current in his education demand seems to be grasping

2938
02:30:59,860 --> 02:31:01,200
and stretching.

2939
02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:05,080
No judge in their right mind would do such a thing as he describes.

2940
02:31:05,080 --> 02:31:06,180
Here's an example.

2941
02:31:06,180 --> 02:31:09,160
Imagine there is a crime in Las Vegas and the criminal kills himself.

2942
02:31:09,160 --> 02:31:13,160
There is no law whatsoever that would allow Alex or anyone else to file a suit in San

2943
02:31:13,160 --> 02:31:16,180
Antonio for anything regarding the crime in Las Vegas.

2944
02:31:16,180 --> 02:31:19,940
There is no claim that could be made in Texas for something that happened in Nevada.

2945
02:31:19,940 --> 02:31:20,940
It is a rule.

2946
02:31:20,940 --> 02:31:21,940
R. Darren Blumfield.

2947
02:31:21,940 --> 02:31:23,940
Have I read all that correctly?

2948
02:31:23,940 --> 02:31:24,940
Yes.

2949
02:31:24,940 --> 02:31:25,940
Okay.

2950
02:31:25,940 --> 02:31:31,460
So here we have that not only did Infowars receive information suggesting that what Halbig

2951
02:31:31,460 --> 02:31:37,380
was up to was completely insane, in Darren Blumfield's words, but actually Nico ended

2952
02:31:37,380 --> 02:31:40,540
up forwarding that information directly to Rob Do.

2953
02:31:40,540 --> 02:31:41,540
Correct?

2954
02:31:41,540 --> 02:31:42,540
Yes.

2955
02:31:42,540 --> 02:31:43,540
Okay.

2956
02:31:43,540 --> 02:31:46,420
Which is good that he found that, because we got about 10,000 emails there, at least

2957
02:31:46,420 --> 02:31:47,420
we did.

2958
02:31:47,420 --> 02:31:48,420
What?

2959
02:31:48,420 --> 02:31:50,420
It's good that he found that in 2015?

2960
02:31:50,420 --> 02:31:51,420
Yeah.

2961
02:31:51,420 --> 02:31:53,620
I mean, it wasn't shown to me, but I mean, that shows he was-

2962
02:31:53,620 --> 02:31:54,620
Is that what you think?

2963
02:31:54,620 --> 02:31:57,980
I guess Rob Do wanted to know about anything come in about San Diego, because he was interested

2964
02:31:57,980 --> 02:31:58,980
in it.

2965
02:31:58,980 --> 02:32:00,540
And so that's why it was sent to him.

2966
02:32:00,540 --> 02:32:01,540
Yeah.

2967
02:32:01,540 --> 02:32:03,300
That it's good that he found it.

2968
02:32:03,300 --> 02:32:05,500
It's not good for you right now.

2969
02:32:05,500 --> 02:32:10,060
Explain to me how you could make my jaw drop more than for Alex to be like, well, it's

2970
02:32:10,060 --> 02:32:11,060
good that he found that.

2971
02:32:11,060 --> 02:32:12,060
What?

2972
02:32:12,060 --> 02:32:13,060
Yeah.

2973
02:32:13,060 --> 02:32:14,060
What are you talking about?

2974
02:32:14,060 --> 02:32:15,060
Wait.

2975
02:32:15,060 --> 02:32:16,980
How could Rob Do have kept this from me?

2976
02:32:16,980 --> 02:32:17,980
Oh no.

2977
02:32:17,980 --> 02:32:20,500
Rob, I'd like you to also meet my friend, Buss.

2978
02:32:20,500 --> 02:32:21,500
Wait.

2979
02:32:21,500 --> 02:32:23,140
This might be bad for me.

2980
02:32:23,140 --> 02:32:24,780
You know what?

2981
02:32:24,780 --> 02:32:26,420
Rob sounds like a real piece of shit.

2982
02:32:26,420 --> 02:32:27,700
Let's get together and go get him.

2983
02:32:27,700 --> 02:32:28,700
Come on, guys.

2984
02:32:28,700 --> 02:32:29,700
This posse is going to be busy.

2985
02:32:29,700 --> 02:32:32,980
We're going to be very busy for a while.

2986
02:32:32,980 --> 02:32:40,300
So the pattern with these emails that has kind of been illustrated, I believe, is they

2987
02:32:40,300 --> 02:32:47,220
have this horrible behavior that Wolfgang is engaging in, that evidence of is clearly

2988
02:32:47,220 --> 02:32:57,060
in Infowars files, and people from Infowars are forwarded on these and CC'd on these emails.

2989
02:32:57,060 --> 02:32:59,460
And have taken action such as forwarding them further.

2990
02:32:59,460 --> 02:33:07,060
Well, the email that is forwarded further from Nico to Rob is someone questioning the

2991
02:33:07,060 --> 02:33:12,100
sanity of this person, which I think in terms of due diligence, maybe you would take a second

2992
02:33:12,100 --> 02:33:16,940
look at the person and notice that, hey, there's these emails where he's harassing Sandy Hook

2993
02:33:16,940 --> 02:33:18,260
family members.

2994
02:33:18,260 --> 02:33:21,700
You might think that would happen, but I guess it didn't.

2995
02:33:21,700 --> 02:33:28,100
And this is a bizarre sort of picture that you get from these emails, but I think it's

2996
02:33:28,100 --> 02:33:34,260
remarkable to see that Alex's response to this is bordering on what he would expect

2997
02:33:34,260 --> 02:33:36,460
a person to feel.

2998
02:33:36,460 --> 02:33:40,900
You know, you hear these emails and this is a horrible email, that's awful, I didn't know

2999
02:33:40,900 --> 02:33:42,140
about this.

3000
02:33:42,140 --> 02:33:45,300
That's exactly what you would do if you, you know, had feelings.

3001
02:33:45,300 --> 02:33:46,300
Right, right, right.

3002
02:33:46,300 --> 02:33:47,300
If you were a human.

3003
02:33:47,300 --> 02:33:48,300
Great.

3004
02:33:48,300 --> 02:33:49,300
And maybe it's an indication that he's a human.

3005
02:33:49,300 --> 02:33:50,740
Eh, well, we'll see.

3006
02:33:50,740 --> 02:33:55,340
So after this, we get into a little bit of a conversation about Dan Badandi and...

3007
02:33:55,340 --> 02:33:56,340
The Kraken!

3008
02:33:56,340 --> 02:33:57,340
Yes.

3009
02:33:57,340 --> 02:34:03,060
And Alex is talking to him to Newtown, and so he plays the clip of Alex calling Badandi

3010
02:34:03,060 --> 02:34:07,060
the Kraken and is like, the Kraken's a mythological beast, right?

3011
02:34:07,060 --> 02:34:14,420
Trying to get into sort of the record and have Alex respond to like, you know, the Kraken,

3012
02:34:14,420 --> 02:34:17,460
that's not somebody that's, you knew he's going to go cause trouble.

3013
02:34:17,460 --> 02:34:18,580
Right, right, right, right.

3014
02:34:18,580 --> 02:34:20,420
And obviously that's the case.

3015
02:34:20,420 --> 02:34:22,220
And Alex is evasive about that.

3016
02:34:22,220 --> 02:34:25,140
Of course he is.

3017
02:34:25,140 --> 02:34:27,420
Which version of the movie are you talking about?

3018
02:34:27,420 --> 02:34:30,380
Cause I mean, Liam Neeson wasn't as good, I don't think, when he said that.

3019
02:34:30,380 --> 02:34:31,860
I have a lot of thoughts about movies.

3020
02:34:31,860 --> 02:34:35,220
I mean, now that we're in a territory I'm comfortable with, let's get into it.

3021
02:34:35,220 --> 02:34:38,180
I tell you about oblivion.

3022
02:34:38,180 --> 02:34:46,460
So we have one last clip here from Alex's deposition, and it's a question of, we've

3023
02:34:46,460 --> 02:34:53,900
seen a lot of bad behavior from folks within Infowars, Vzavi, Sandy Hook, and Wolfgang,

3024
02:34:53,900 --> 02:34:54,900
and Fetzer.

3025
02:34:54,900 --> 02:34:55,900
How do you say that?

3026
02:34:55,900 --> 02:34:57,340
Illustrated throughout this deposition.

3027
02:34:57,340 --> 02:34:58,340
Possible.

3028
02:34:58,340 --> 02:35:04,740
So the question of editorial standards and that kind of thing comes up.

3029
02:35:04,740 --> 02:35:05,740
Sure.

3030
02:35:05,740 --> 02:35:08,500
And this isn't the best response Alex could have.

3031
02:35:08,500 --> 02:35:17,000
Your company has never disciplined anyone due to a false fact about Sandy Hook published

3032
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:22,300
on Infowars, correct?

3033
02:35:22,300 --> 02:35:23,300
I don't remember.

3034
02:35:23,300 --> 02:35:24,660
Good work, Knott Barnes.

3035
02:35:24,660 --> 02:35:28,980
You think it's possible you may have disciplined somebody for something false about Sandy Hook?

3036
02:35:28,980 --> 02:35:29,980
I wouldn't say false.

3037
02:35:29,980 --> 02:35:35,340
I mean, people have gotten in trouble for talking about it, but I've tried to like,

3038
02:35:35,340 --> 02:35:39,180
you know, stay out of it and myself get sucked back into it.

3039
02:35:39,180 --> 02:35:41,620
I think people testify to that too, at least that's what I was told.

3040
02:35:41,620 --> 02:35:45,180
You just said you wanted people to look into it.

3041
02:35:45,180 --> 02:35:50,380
In 2015, went to people like Adan Salazar and told him stop printing articles about

3042
02:35:50,380 --> 02:35:55,980
Sandy Hook is because Leonard Posner was kept getting strikes against the company, right?

3043
02:35:55,980 --> 02:35:57,460
I don't remember if it was Leonard Posner.

3044
02:35:57,460 --> 02:36:00,980
I mean, I know I've seen people make a big thing between me and Leonard Posner.

3045
02:36:00,980 --> 02:36:06,340
I barely know who he is and I've seen him in some shows, but I know I just did not.

3046
02:36:06,340 --> 02:36:14,060
Yes, I mean, I did not want to I had I had seen some of the anomalies and things be proven

3047
02:36:14,060 --> 02:36:18,900
to not be anomalies, and so I wasn't sure that it was staged, but then, you know, I

3048
02:36:18,900 --> 02:36:26,180
go back and forth like anybody on these kind of these mysteries, but what?

3049
02:36:26,180 --> 02:36:28,260
So that's that's that's where I stand on that.

3050
02:36:28,260 --> 02:36:32,460
That's not that's not an ideal answer, but have you punished anybody?

3051
02:36:32,460 --> 02:36:37,060
Is there any consequences for anybody who's published false things about Sandy Hook?

3052
02:36:37,060 --> 02:36:39,340
Hey, look, there's a mystery.

3053
02:36:39,340 --> 02:36:41,540
I just don't I don't know.

3054
02:36:41,540 --> 02:36:47,540
I don't know how you could take this to a jury and not say to them, like, listen, this

3055
02:36:47,540 --> 02:36:50,260
is a man who's already lost the case.

3056
02:36:50,260 --> 02:36:57,580
This is a man who's under oath in a case that he lost for saying that this isn't real, right?

3057
02:36:57,580 --> 02:37:03,620
Saying this isn't real or it might not be, or he still has questions over it.

3058
02:37:03,620 --> 02:37:07,820
We're well past the point where you can say, like, oh, we'll have our day in court.

3059
02:37:07,820 --> 02:37:08,820
It's already gone.

3060
02:37:08,820 --> 02:37:09,820
Yeah.

3061
02:37:09,820 --> 02:37:13,940
So there's no way to do anything other than say this man has to be stopped.

3062
02:37:13,940 --> 02:37:15,660
Well, I think, you know, yeah.

3063
02:37:15,660 --> 02:37:21,540
I think a lot of the the appearance that you get from from this deposition is certainly

3064
02:37:21,540 --> 02:37:29,060
a lack of remorse, a lack of having learned anything, a lack of even seeming to be willing

3065
02:37:29,060 --> 02:37:31,580
to understand the problem.

3066
02:37:31,580 --> 02:37:33,340
Basic comprehension of reality.

3067
02:37:33,340 --> 02:37:34,340
Yes.

3068
02:37:34,340 --> 02:37:35,340
Yeah.

3069
02:37:35,340 --> 02:37:41,260
There's also clearly an indication that he intends to continue the papers.

3070
02:37:41,260 --> 02:37:42,260
Absolutely.

3071
02:37:42,260 --> 02:37:49,660
I mean, and almost a strange, extreme solipsism, almost as if like, wait, wait, wait, what

3072
02:37:49,660 --> 02:37:50,660
are you talking about?

3073
02:37:50,660 --> 02:37:53,620
This happened outside of what I experienced, so it doesn't matter, right?

3074
02:37:53,620 --> 02:37:58,860
It's not real because I didn't read this email, so it doesn't matter to me.

3075
02:37:58,860 --> 02:37:59,860
Yeah.

3076
02:37:59,860 --> 02:38:08,580
And even beyond that, like a real lack of institutional guardrails within Infowars where

3077
02:38:08,580 --> 02:38:12,820
there is no, like, standards for what they can or can't report.

3078
02:38:12,820 --> 02:38:13,980
It's chaos.

3079
02:38:13,980 --> 02:38:15,940
There's no consequences for anything.

3080
02:38:15,940 --> 02:38:24,460
There's no standards for sending the fucking, not prosecution, plaintiff, a fucking background

3081
02:38:24,460 --> 02:38:25,460
report.

3082
02:38:25,460 --> 02:38:27,460
Which you don't know you did.

3083
02:38:27,460 --> 02:38:29,380
Which you don't know you did?

3084
02:38:29,380 --> 02:38:32,820
We got it before we even start with the journalistic standards.

3085
02:38:32,820 --> 02:38:33,820
It's wild.

3086
02:38:33,820 --> 02:38:34,820
What do you even have?

3087
02:38:34,820 --> 02:38:35,820
Yeah.

3088
02:38:35,820 --> 02:38:37,820
Take an inventory of what you even have.

3089
02:38:37,820 --> 02:38:41,260
What's in the building?

3090
02:38:41,260 --> 02:38:49,460
So now, Jordan, we jump over to the corporate representative deposition of Daria Karpova.

3091
02:38:49,460 --> 02:38:52,180
Oh boy, here we go.

3092
02:38:52,180 --> 02:38:56,100
I was a little disappointed, I believe I said this when we were talking to Mark, that it

3093
02:38:56,100 --> 02:39:01,340
wasn't Rob Doo again, but there are Doo-ish characteristics to this.

3094
02:39:01,340 --> 02:39:02,340
It's Doo-esque.

3095
02:39:02,340 --> 02:39:03,340
Sure.

3096
02:39:03,340 --> 02:39:04,340
Yes.

3097
02:39:04,340 --> 02:39:09,540
There were hints of Doo-esque.

3098
02:39:09,540 --> 02:39:14,860
I think that we'll probably skip over a fair amount of this, because it is, in the same

3099
02:39:14,860 --> 02:39:20,420
way that Rob's deposition was, there were a lot of just, like, I don't know.

3100
02:39:20,420 --> 02:39:22,260
Like, does the company know or not know?

3101
02:39:22,260 --> 02:39:23,260
I don't know.

3102
02:39:23,260 --> 02:39:25,360
I don't know if the company knows, I don't know.

3103
02:39:25,360 --> 02:39:26,360
I don't know.

3104
02:39:26,360 --> 02:39:33,380
Yeah, there is a ton of that, and the deposition itself is, like, five hours long.

3105
02:39:33,380 --> 02:39:39,620
And so we're going to chop out a fair amount of that, and just talk about what is the matter.

3106
02:39:39,620 --> 02:39:40,620
What's the point here?

3107
02:39:40,620 --> 02:39:41,620
Yeah.

3108
02:39:41,620 --> 02:39:44,700
From the way you described it to me, I got a little bit of, like, what would it be like

3109
02:39:44,700 --> 02:39:48,160
to depose Donald Rumsfeld?

3110
02:39:48,160 --> 02:39:54,060
I think that Donald Rumsfeld might take less long pauses before answering questions.

3111
02:39:54,060 --> 02:39:55,460
He's a lot slicker.

3112
02:39:55,460 --> 02:39:58,420
Every single question, there's a long pause, unfortunately.

3113
02:39:58,420 --> 02:40:00,220
Actually, I think it's probably a good strategy.

3114
02:40:00,220 --> 02:40:03,620
Oh, it's much smarter than Alex's strategy of saying whatever.

3115
02:40:03,620 --> 02:40:04,620
Yeah.

3116
02:40:04,620 --> 02:40:07,900
Hey, what do you not know that I can give to you that would help you?

3117
02:40:07,900 --> 02:40:11,700
Although I will say that I think that some of the strategies that she does employ in

3118
02:40:11,700 --> 02:40:16,140
terms of answering questions are not much better, and maybe are more shocking and way

3119
02:40:16,140 --> 02:40:17,940
more offensive than some of the things Alex said.

3120
02:40:17,940 --> 02:40:19,100
Well, that sounds about right.

3121
02:40:19,100 --> 02:40:20,140
So strap it in.

3122
02:40:20,140 --> 02:40:21,140
Here we go.

3123
02:40:21,140 --> 02:40:25,840
So at the beginning of this, at the start, Mark asks a number of questions to try and

3124
02:40:25,840 --> 02:40:31,420
nail down how much preparation Daria did for the deposition, and with whom she consulted.

3125
02:40:31,420 --> 02:40:35,500
The preparation is clearly minimal, and the questions are kind of repetitive, so I'm going

3126
02:40:35,500 --> 02:40:38,580
to skip past that bit where that's discussed.

3127
02:40:38,580 --> 02:40:39,580
I'll put it this way.

3128
02:40:39,580 --> 02:40:44,140
On a scale of one to ten, she's not very prepared, but a little more than Rob do.

3129
02:40:44,140 --> 02:40:45,140
Right.

3130
02:40:45,140 --> 02:40:46,140
So she's a 1.2.

3131
02:40:46,140 --> 02:40:47,140
Maybe.

3132
02:40:47,140 --> 02:40:50,340
On a scale of one to ten, she's a 0.8.

3133
02:40:50,340 --> 02:40:51,340
Right, right.

3134
02:40:51,340 --> 02:40:52,740
Oh, I thought with...

3135
02:40:52,740 --> 02:40:53,740
Okay.

3136
02:40:53,740 --> 02:40:54,740
It's not zero.

3137
02:40:54,740 --> 02:40:59,900
Yeah, I thought do was at the one, since it's a scale of one to ten.

3138
02:40:59,900 --> 02:41:00,900
You can't use it to the negatives.

3139
02:41:00,900 --> 02:41:02,820
You can't have a negative on a scale like, oh, you're cheating.

3140
02:41:02,820 --> 02:41:04,420
I'm having a number war.

3141
02:41:04,420 --> 02:41:05,420
You are.

3142
02:41:05,420 --> 02:41:09,500
So this leads us to Mark presenting Daria with a folder that she had brought along that

3143
02:41:09,500 --> 02:41:12,860
contained what she wanted to introduce into evidence.

3144
02:41:12,860 --> 02:41:17,340
She had brought along some documents, and this is where we're at.

3145
02:41:17,340 --> 02:41:18,340
Beautiful.

3146
02:41:18,340 --> 02:41:19,340
Now, I understand.

3147
02:41:19,340 --> 02:41:20,340
I've been given a folder.

3148
02:41:20,340 --> 02:41:23,100
Do you recognize this folder that I'm holding right here?

3149
02:41:23,100 --> 02:41:24,100
Yes.

3150
02:41:24,100 --> 02:41:27,900
Have you been told that these are documents that you reviewed prior to this deposition?

3151
02:41:27,900 --> 02:41:28,900
Yes.

3152
02:41:28,900 --> 02:41:29,900
Okay.

3153
02:41:29,900 --> 02:41:35,220
So you have taken the documents that you prepared yourself for today and put them in this folder?

3154
02:41:35,220 --> 02:41:36,220
Correct.

3155
02:41:36,220 --> 02:41:37,220
Okay.

3156
02:41:37,220 --> 02:41:38,220
I want to right now...

3157
02:41:38,220 --> 02:41:39,220
No, let's do them individually.

3158
02:41:39,220 --> 02:41:40,220
Yeah, that's probably not the best.

3159
02:41:40,220 --> 02:41:41,220
That's not the worst idea.

3160
02:41:41,220 --> 02:41:42,220
Okay.

3161
02:41:42,220 --> 02:41:53,380
So, ma'am, what I'm going to do is I'm going to put a sticker on this folder itself, and

3162
02:41:53,380 --> 02:41:54,860
we're going to mark that as Exhibit 1.

3163
02:41:54,860 --> 02:41:55,860
Okay.

3164
02:41:55,860 --> 02:41:58,000
And I want to talk to you about some of the documents in here.

3165
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:04,460
So each exhibit is going to be like 1A, 1B, 1C in this folder of things she's brought.

3166
02:42:04,460 --> 02:42:10,140
And I think I can say this without giving away any privileged information.

3167
02:42:10,140 --> 02:42:12,060
This was the first one.

3168
02:42:12,060 --> 02:42:16,700
In terms of like what day one was the Daria deposition, then the next day was Alex.

3169
02:42:16,700 --> 02:42:21,560
So this was my first moments of being in this setting.

3170
02:42:21,560 --> 02:42:24,700
And I was just like, I just like, I got to get a seatbelt.

3171
02:42:24,700 --> 02:42:28,580
I got to strap this in because here is where we begin with these documents.

3172
02:42:28,580 --> 02:42:30,980
I've marked this as 1A.

3173
02:42:30,980 --> 02:42:32,660
You recognize that, correct?

3174
02:42:32,660 --> 02:42:35,300
That's a document that you reviewed prior to this deposition, right?

3175
02:42:35,300 --> 02:42:36,300
Correct.

3176
02:42:36,300 --> 02:42:40,660
That is the Wikipedia entry for false flag, correct?

3177
02:42:40,660 --> 02:42:42,100
Yes.

3178
02:42:42,100 --> 02:42:43,700
Okay.

3179
02:42:43,700 --> 02:42:45,900
Can you tell me why you looked at this document?

3180
02:42:45,900 --> 02:42:57,100
I thought it would be a good idea to bring it as a reference to some of the points for

3181
02:42:57,100 --> 02:42:59,520
topic number one.

3182
02:42:59,520 --> 02:43:03,620
If I could have the list of topics that would help me to identify the exhibits.

3183
02:43:03,620 --> 02:43:04,620
I understand what you're saying.

3184
02:43:04,620 --> 02:43:06,380
In fact, let's do that.

3185
02:43:06,380 --> 02:43:10,500
So the topic that Daria is referring to is the sourcing and research that went into the

3186
02:43:10,500 --> 02:43:14,460
productions of the videos that are listed in the plaintiff's case.

3187
02:43:14,460 --> 02:43:18,420
So I don't know what she needs the false flag Wikipedia page for.

3188
02:43:18,420 --> 02:43:21,060
I felt like this had not started well.

3189
02:43:21,060 --> 02:43:22,180
I was worried.

3190
02:43:22,180 --> 02:43:29,540
I mean, I'm thinking about this now, and I'm thinking about removing the sticker that says

3191
02:43:29,540 --> 02:43:36,300
1A and putting a new sticker on that says, grape job, and you can scratch it and it smells

3192
02:43:36,300 --> 02:43:37,300
like grapes, Dan!

3193
02:43:37,300 --> 02:43:38,300
Four stars.

3194
02:43:38,300 --> 02:43:39,300
Tell her to go home to her mother.

3195
02:43:39,300 --> 02:43:40,300
Exactly.

3196
02:43:40,300 --> 02:43:41,300
Good God.

3197
02:43:41,300 --> 02:43:43,580
So here's the next document we get.

3198
02:43:43,580 --> 02:43:48,300
So now I have handed you what I've marked as 1C, which you recognize, correct?

3199
02:43:48,300 --> 02:43:49,300
Correct.

3200
02:43:49,300 --> 02:43:53,020
And that is the Wikipedia entry for the Reichstag fire, correct?

3201
02:43:53,020 --> 02:43:54,020
Yes.

3202
02:43:54,020 --> 02:44:02,100
The Reichstag fire was a Nazi party arson attack, correct?

3203
02:44:02,100 --> 02:44:03,100
Correct.

3204
02:44:03,100 --> 02:44:04,100
Okay.

3205
02:44:04,100 --> 02:44:11,160
Can you tell me why this is relevant to the case?

3206
02:44:11,160 --> 02:44:14,300
Same answer as for the previous exhibit.

3207
02:44:14,300 --> 02:44:25,740
I thought it would be a document pertaining to some of the points in topic number one

3208
02:44:25,740 --> 02:44:28,820
as an example of false flags.

3209
02:44:28,820 --> 02:44:29,820
Hmm.

3210
02:44:29,820 --> 02:44:30,820
Okay.

3211
02:44:30,820 --> 02:44:32,540
Another Wikipedia page.

3212
02:44:32,540 --> 02:44:37,680
To paraphrase the one funny thing Pete Holmes ever said, it seems like you printed out a

3213
02:44:37,680 --> 02:44:41,340
part of the internet for us to throw away.

3214
02:44:41,340 --> 02:44:49,220
Yeah, it's strange, because again, as the corporate representative, the lion's share

3215
02:44:49,220 --> 02:44:54,620
of what she's supposed to be discussing is sourcing and personnel who worked on the videos

3216
02:44:54,620 --> 02:45:00,220
in question, and that has nothing to do with the Reichstag fire's Wikipedia page.

3217
02:45:00,220 --> 02:45:01,220
Disagree.

3218
02:45:01,220 --> 02:45:02,220
Sources?

3219
02:45:02,220 --> 02:45:03,220
Mostly Nazis.

3220
02:45:03,220 --> 02:45:04,220
Fair enough.

3221
02:45:04,220 --> 02:45:05,220
Let's see if the next one's better.

3222
02:45:05,220 --> 02:45:09,300
We'll put it into 1D.

3223
02:45:09,300 --> 02:45:10,620
You recognize that?

3224
02:45:10,620 --> 02:45:11,620
Yes.

3225
02:45:11,620 --> 02:45:12,620
Okay.

3226
02:45:12,620 --> 02:45:14,620
Where does, can you read the website at the bottom?

3227
02:45:14,620 --> 02:45:16,340
What website does that come from?

3228
02:45:16,340 --> 02:45:17,340
Historytoday.com.

3229
02:45:17,340 --> 02:45:18,340
Okay.

3230
02:45:18,340 --> 02:45:23,100
So this is a History Today article about the sinking of the main, correct?

3231
02:45:23,100 --> 02:45:24,100
Correct.

3232
02:45:24,100 --> 02:45:25,100
Okay.

3233
02:45:25,100 --> 02:45:29,620
The USS Maine was a 19th century warship, correct?

3234
02:45:29,620 --> 02:45:30,620
Correct.

3235
02:45:30,620 --> 02:45:31,620
Okay.

3236
02:45:31,620 --> 02:45:33,820
And that warship exploded in Havana Harbor, correct?

3237
02:45:33,820 --> 02:45:34,820
Correct.

3238
02:45:34,820 --> 02:45:39,740
There is significant historical evidence to suggest that that ship was intentionally exploded

3239
02:45:39,740 --> 02:45:41,140
by the United States government.

3240
02:45:41,140 --> 02:45:42,140
That's correct?

3241
02:45:42,140 --> 02:45:49,300
There is a controversy about it, let's say.

3242
02:45:49,300 --> 02:45:54,140
In other words, what I'm wondering is, from reading that article, did you come away with

3243
02:45:54,140 --> 02:46:07,020
the idea that there is substantial evidence, in other words, non-trivial evidence, which

3244
02:46:07,020 --> 02:46:11,540
people could use to support the idea that the USS Maine was intentionally destroyed

3245
02:46:11,540 --> 02:46:12,540
by the United States government?

3246
02:46:12,540 --> 02:46:27,900
I would say one could infer that.

3247
02:46:27,900 --> 02:46:28,900
Okay.

3248
02:46:28,900 --> 02:46:34,220
Can you tell me why that particular article is relevant to your testimony today?

3249
02:46:34,220 --> 02:46:37,820
It could be viewed as an example of false flags.

3250
02:46:37,820 --> 02:46:38,820
Okay.

3251
02:46:38,820 --> 02:46:40,420
Throughout history.

3252
02:46:40,420 --> 02:46:41,420
Cool.

3253
02:46:41,420 --> 02:46:44,700
So at this point, I think it becomes a bit clear that the strategy of the articles that

3254
02:46:44,700 --> 02:46:49,020
Daria has in the folder amounts to a lazy attempt at illustrating that false flags have

3255
02:46:49,020 --> 02:46:53,220
happened in the past, and thus it's not so out of left field for Alex to question whether

3256
02:46:53,220 --> 02:46:56,020
any event may or may not be another one.

3257
02:46:56,020 --> 02:46:59,700
That's all good and well, but it's really superfluous to the questions at hand.

3258
02:46:59,700 --> 02:47:03,220
And the thing that I find most interesting is that while being questioned about the article

3259
02:47:03,220 --> 02:47:07,340
concerning the sinking of the Maine, Daria seems unwilling to commit to even saying that

3260
02:47:07,340 --> 02:47:11,340
there's evidence that it was a false flag, only going so far as to say that there's controversy.

3261
02:47:11,340 --> 02:47:12,340
She's cagey.

3262
02:47:12,340 --> 02:47:13,340
Yeah.

3263
02:47:13,340 --> 02:47:20,020
That's some of the vibe you might be getting in the early stages of this.

3264
02:47:20,020 --> 02:47:25,420
I thought that was a little bit weird, but I guess maybe it could make some strategic

3265
02:47:25,420 --> 02:47:30,420
sense in that you don't have to prove anything as a false flag, all you have to do is prove

3266
02:47:30,420 --> 02:47:35,500
that some things people say are, because that's the behavior you're trying to justify in terms

3267
02:47:35,500 --> 02:47:36,500
of Alex.

3268
02:47:36,500 --> 02:47:37,500
Right.

3269
02:47:37,500 --> 02:47:43,220
I mean, I just want to ask this question over and over and over again to all of these people,

3270
02:47:43,220 --> 02:47:48,100
just like, let's strip away all the bullshit on a fundamental level.

3271
02:47:48,100 --> 02:47:51,300
Do you know why you're here?

3272
02:47:51,300 --> 02:47:53,740
Just like, why?

3273
02:47:53,740 --> 02:47:55,700
What are you here to do?

3274
02:47:55,700 --> 02:47:56,700
Yeah.

3275
02:47:56,700 --> 02:47:57,700
You know?

3276
02:47:57,700 --> 02:48:02,740
Again, it's going back to that stuff with Alex, you have to get back to like fundamentals.

3277
02:48:02,740 --> 02:48:03,740
What is water?

3278
02:48:03,740 --> 02:48:05,340
Is it the wet stuff?

3279
02:48:05,340 --> 02:48:06,420
Is that it?

3280
02:48:06,420 --> 02:48:09,100
Is it something else?

3281
02:48:09,100 --> 02:48:10,100
Can you breathe water?

3282
02:48:10,100 --> 02:48:11,100
Yeah.

3283
02:48:11,100 --> 02:48:14,500
Oh, hey, listen, if you think water is air and that's how we have to talk about it and

3284
02:48:14,500 --> 02:48:19,380
I have to say water is air and air is water, that's fucking fine as long as we agree.

3285
02:48:19,380 --> 02:48:20,860
At least we'll be able to communicate.

3286
02:48:20,860 --> 02:48:21,860
Exactly.

3287
02:48:21,860 --> 02:48:22,860
Yeah.

3288
02:48:22,860 --> 02:48:23,860
That's all I need to know, man.

3289
02:48:23,860 --> 02:48:24,860
Yeah.

3290
02:48:24,860 --> 02:48:27,620
It's that idea that the beginning of communication is the definition of terms.

3291
02:48:27,620 --> 02:48:28,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3292
02:48:28,620 --> 02:48:34,060
You can't really, and I do think that that does come into a problem with interacting

3293
02:48:34,060 --> 02:48:39,300
with folks from Infowars as it seems from these depositions in particular that I've

3294
02:48:39,300 --> 02:48:40,300
seen.

3295
02:48:40,300 --> 02:48:41,300
I mean.

3296
02:48:41,300 --> 02:48:43,900
It seems like you're not having, you're talking in different languages.

3297
02:48:43,900 --> 02:48:51,420
Do you know what it makes me think of when we talked to John Ronson, he very briefly

3298
02:48:51,420 --> 02:48:56,580
had this moment where we went kind of far off and he just said, you know, he was wondering

3299
02:48:56,580 --> 02:49:01,380
how is it that we can judge Alex, you know, just in this sense of like, do we judge him

3300
02:49:01,380 --> 02:49:06,060
the way we judge other people because he's clearly not like other people.

3301
02:49:06,060 --> 02:49:07,380
Who can you judge him by?

3302
02:49:07,380 --> 02:49:09,940
What is the standard by which Alex can be judged?

3303
02:49:09,940 --> 02:49:15,820
And it's like when you have an entire organization that is thinking it's totally fine to print

3304
02:49:15,820 --> 02:49:19,720
out a Wikipedia article and take it to a deposition.

3305
02:49:19,720 --> 02:49:20,720
I don't know.

3306
02:49:20,720 --> 02:49:22,220
They're aliens.

3307
02:49:22,220 --> 02:49:23,220
That's what it is.

3308
02:49:23,220 --> 02:49:24,220
They're just aliens.

3309
02:49:24,220 --> 02:49:25,220
You know?

3310
02:49:25,220 --> 02:49:30,160
It introduces a really strange question that is like, is this somebody who's trying to

3311
02:49:30,160 --> 02:49:34,460
bluff a report like, like, like, ah, this'll do.

3312
02:49:34,460 --> 02:49:38,580
Or is it someone who doesn't care or is it an active insult?

3313
02:49:38,580 --> 02:49:39,580
Yeah.

3314
02:49:39,580 --> 02:49:40,580
Like I don't know.

3315
02:49:40,580 --> 02:49:42,460
And it could, I don't, I, yeah, exactly.

3316
02:49:42,460 --> 02:49:43,460
Aliens.

3317
02:49:43,460 --> 02:49:44,460
Just complete aliens.

3318
02:49:44,460 --> 02:49:46,020
I don't understand what is happening.

3319
02:49:46,020 --> 02:49:47,020
Yeah.

3320
02:49:47,020 --> 02:49:48,780
But maybe like the rest of these documents will help you.

3321
02:49:48,780 --> 02:49:49,780
I'm sure they will.

3322
02:49:49,780 --> 02:49:50,780
I'm sure they will.

3323
02:49:50,780 --> 02:49:54,660
I'm going to put in front of you one E. You recognize that, correct?

3324
02:49:54,660 --> 02:49:55,660
Yes.

3325
02:49:55,660 --> 02:50:01,780
This is a Wikipedia entry for the Pearl Harbor advanced knowledge conspiracy theory, correct?

3326
02:50:01,780 --> 02:50:02,780
Correct.

3327
02:50:02,780 --> 02:50:04,580
Is this same answer as the other documents?

3328
02:50:04,580 --> 02:50:05,580
Yes.

3329
02:50:05,580 --> 02:50:06,580
Okay.

3330
02:50:06,580 --> 02:50:13,420
So this is another example of potentially, well, let me back up.

3331
02:50:13,420 --> 02:50:17,820
Would you call this a false flag, for instance, if, let me rephrase that question.

3332
02:50:17,820 --> 02:50:21,540
If the allegations about this conspiracy theory are true, would you consider that a false

3333
02:50:21,540 --> 02:50:24,140
flag?

3334
02:50:24,140 --> 02:50:25,140
I would say so.

3335
02:50:25,140 --> 02:50:29,860
So we have another Wikipedia article about conspiracy theories about Pearl Harbor.

3336
02:50:29,860 --> 02:50:32,460
I think the point's made by this point, right?

3337
02:50:32,460 --> 02:50:33,460
Nope.

3338
02:50:33,460 --> 02:50:34,460
I don't know.

3339
02:50:34,460 --> 02:50:35,460
Nope.

3340
02:50:35,460 --> 02:50:36,460
You don't understand.

3341
02:50:36,460 --> 02:50:37,460
I don't know why we need more.

3342
02:50:37,460 --> 02:50:39,420
So at least the documents aren't all just Wikipedia pages.

3343
02:50:39,420 --> 02:50:43,060
Some of them are bios for weirdos.

3344
02:50:43,060 --> 02:50:44,060
Like the back of a book jacket?

3345
02:50:44,060 --> 02:50:45,060
I'm going to put it in front of you one E. You recognize that?

3346
02:50:45,060 --> 02:50:46,060
Yes.

3347
02:50:46,060 --> 02:50:47,060
Can you explain what that is?

3348
02:50:47,060 --> 02:51:00,660
Yes, it is an article that was archived from the website DC Clothesline, which includes

3349
02:51:00,660 --> 02:51:06,140
Mr. Halbig's biography, which I wanted to have on hand.

3350
02:51:06,140 --> 02:51:07,140
Okay.

3351
02:51:07,140 --> 02:51:10,580
So this is just biographical information about one of Infowars sources.

3352
02:51:10,580 --> 02:51:11,580
Correct.

3353
02:51:11,580 --> 02:51:15,580
So we got Wolfgang Halbig's bio.

3354
02:51:15,580 --> 02:51:16,980
And we have another bio.

3355
02:51:16,980 --> 02:51:17,980
All right.

3356
02:51:17,980 --> 02:51:18,980
I'm going to show you a marked as 1H.

3357
02:51:18,980 --> 02:51:19,980
You recognize that?

3358
02:51:19,980 --> 02:51:20,980
Yes.

3359
02:51:20,980 --> 02:51:23,380
That's from Dr. Steve Puchenik's website, isn't it?

3360
02:51:23,380 --> 02:51:24,380
Yes.

3361
02:51:24,380 --> 02:51:25,380
Okay.

3362
02:51:25,380 --> 02:51:27,100
And that's basically a biography of Dr. Steve Puchenik?

3363
02:51:27,100 --> 02:51:28,100
Correct.

3364
02:51:28,100 --> 02:51:29,100
Okay.

3365
02:51:29,100 --> 02:51:32,260
And you wanted to have that because Steve Puchenik is somebody who has appeared on Infowars

3366
02:51:32,260 --> 02:51:34,300
at one point to talk about San Diego.

3367
02:51:34,300 --> 02:51:35,300
Correct.

3368
02:51:35,300 --> 02:51:36,300
Okay.

3369
02:51:36,300 --> 02:51:40,900
I do regret that unfortunately in this deposition, more questions aren't asked about Steve Puchenik.

3370
02:51:40,900 --> 02:51:41,900
Yeah.

3371
02:51:41,900 --> 02:51:42,900
Yeah.

3372
02:51:42,900 --> 02:51:46,420
Because I think having anybody have to answer for like some of the bullshit.

3373
02:51:46,420 --> 02:51:47,420
Even just the bio.

3374
02:51:47,420 --> 02:51:48,420
Yeah.

3375
02:51:48,420 --> 02:51:50,420
Just be like, how much of this do you actually think is-

3376
02:51:50,420 --> 02:51:51,420
Let's just go through it.

3377
02:51:51,420 --> 02:51:53,360
Let's just go through it and you tell me what's true and what's not true.

3378
02:51:53,360 --> 02:51:54,940
You brought it into evidence, man.

3379
02:51:54,940 --> 02:51:55,940
That's what's going on now.

3380
02:51:55,940 --> 02:51:56,940
Yeah.

3381
02:51:56,940 --> 02:51:57,940
Yeah.

3382
02:51:57,940 --> 02:52:00,340
So we've got the bio of these two people, which I think is, I mean, I don't think it

3383
02:52:00,340 --> 02:52:05,940
matters much, but at least it seems more relevant to what you might bring.

3384
02:52:05,940 --> 02:52:06,940
Right.

3385
02:52:06,940 --> 02:52:10,940
And then there's another document in there and this is where things start to get real

3386
02:52:10,940 --> 02:52:11,940
fucked-

3387
02:52:11,940 --> 02:52:13,140
My daughter drew a picture.

3388
02:52:13,140 --> 02:52:14,540
Things are real fucked up at this point.

3389
02:52:14,540 --> 02:52:15,540
It is really weird.

3390
02:52:15,540 --> 02:52:16,540
I'm going to show you now.

3391
02:52:16,540 --> 02:52:17,540
Okay.

3392
02:52:17,540 --> 02:52:20,660
I'm going to show you now what I have marked as one I.

3393
02:52:20,660 --> 02:52:23,380
You recognize that?

3394
02:52:23,380 --> 02:52:24,380
Yes.

3395
02:52:24,380 --> 02:52:26,860
That's a Guardian article, right?

3396
02:52:26,860 --> 02:52:27,860
Correct.

3397
02:52:27,860 --> 02:52:29,860
Guardian's a newspaper in Britain.

3398
02:52:29,860 --> 02:52:31,860
Am I right about that?

3399
02:52:31,860 --> 02:52:32,860
Yes.

3400
02:52:32,860 --> 02:52:33,860
Okay.

3401
02:52:33,860 --> 02:52:37,500
This article says, it's headline says, Sandy Hook father, Leonard Posner on death threats.

3402
02:52:37,500 --> 02:52:40,460
I never imagined having to fight for my child's legacy.

3403
02:52:40,460 --> 02:52:41,460
Correct?

3404
02:52:41,460 --> 02:52:42,460
Correct.

3405
02:52:42,460 --> 02:52:44,460
What did you need this article for in your testimony today?

3406
02:52:44,460 --> 02:52:46,860
Let me, that's not a good question.

3407
02:52:46,860 --> 02:52:50,140
Why did you feel you wanted to review this article for your testimony today?

3408
02:52:50,140 --> 02:52:51,980
After this, there is a long pause.

3409
02:52:51,980 --> 02:52:52,980
Yeah.

3410
02:52:52,980 --> 02:52:53,980
Because-

3411
02:52:53,980 --> 02:52:54,980
A very long pause.

3412
02:52:54,980 --> 02:52:59,620
I don't, I don't know if it's a long pause of like trying to remember why or if it was

3413
02:52:59,620 --> 02:53:02,220
like a, how do I say this or-

3414
02:53:02,220 --> 02:53:03,220
Yeah.

3415
02:53:03,220 --> 02:53:07,140
I'm not sure, but it goes off the fucking rails.

3416
02:53:07,140 --> 02:53:14,860
The reason I wanted to have this article is that I thought one of the victim's mother,

3417
02:53:14,860 --> 02:53:20,580
there was interesting information regarding the victim's mother and her request to have

3418
02:53:20,580 --> 02:53:22,780
an open casket for the funeral.

3419
02:53:22,780 --> 02:53:34,700
Why is that interesting here?

3420
02:53:34,700 --> 02:53:44,500
It seems to me that the motivation for doing so would be to exploit

3421
02:53:44,500 --> 02:53:49,980
a child's death for a political agenda.

3422
02:53:49,980 --> 02:53:55,340
Might another reason for it is because a bunch of people were saying that child was fake.

3423
02:53:55,340 --> 02:53:57,020
Couldn't that be a reason for it?

3424
02:53:57,020 --> 02:53:59,220
I don't know.

3425
02:53:59,220 --> 02:54:00,220
Oh boy.

3426
02:54:00,220 --> 02:54:01,220
Oh boy.

3427
02:54:01,220 --> 02:54:06,500
So she has brought a Guardian article that references how Ms. De La Rosa had opted to

3428
02:54:06,500 --> 02:54:07,500
have-

3429
02:54:07,500 --> 02:54:08,500
An open casket funeral.

3430
02:54:08,500 --> 02:54:11,240
So, um, you know, we, this is dicey.

3431
02:54:11,240 --> 02:54:12,700
This feels real Mark Dicey.

3432
02:54:12,700 --> 02:54:15,500
I'm not stoked about the direction it's going.

3433
02:54:15,500 --> 02:54:16,500
No.

3434
02:54:16,500 --> 02:54:17,500
No.

3435
02:54:17,500 --> 02:54:19,380
And it gets, uh, I mean-

3436
02:54:19,380 --> 02:54:22,860
Sitting here right now, if your child, let's back up.

3437
02:54:22,860 --> 02:54:24,860
You just, you just had a baby, right?

3438
02:54:24,860 --> 02:54:25,860
Yes.

3439
02:54:25,860 --> 02:54:26,860
Okay.

3440
02:54:26,860 --> 02:54:29,620
Let's say six years from now, your child walks into elementary school and is massacred in

3441
02:54:29,620 --> 02:54:35,380
a gun violence incident and some news organizations, you're saying that your child is fake.

3442
02:54:35,380 --> 02:54:38,820
Can you see that a possible way to combat that would be to have an open casket funeral

3443
02:54:38,820 --> 02:54:39,820
for your child?

3444
02:54:39,820 --> 02:54:40,820
No.

3445
02:54:40,820 --> 02:54:42,180
That's not something you would ever consider?

3446
02:54:42,180 --> 02:54:43,180
No.

3447
02:54:43,180 --> 02:54:46,220
You could, you can imagine how somebody else could consider that.

3448
02:54:46,220 --> 02:54:56,340
Not if they have a heart and no political agenda.

3449
02:54:56,340 --> 02:54:57,340
Okay.

3450
02:54:57,340 --> 02:55:04,640
So you think that this Jewish family's choice to have an open casket funeral for their child

3451
02:55:04,640 --> 02:55:07,340
was politically motivated?

3452
02:55:07,340 --> 02:55:11,060
I'm going to object to this being outside the scope of a corporate representative testimony.

3453
02:55:11,060 --> 02:55:12,060
That's fine.

3454
02:55:12,060 --> 02:55:13,060
Ooh.

3455
02:55:13,060 --> 02:55:17,460
So they discuss this objection and then they determine that she should answer the question.

3456
02:55:17,460 --> 02:55:21,060
Oh, I thought Brad finally had one good thing to, you know?

3457
02:55:21,060 --> 02:55:25,180
Well, I mean, the objection might be fine, but it's, it's, it's still going to answer

3458
02:55:25,180 --> 02:55:26,180
the question.

3459
02:55:26,180 --> 02:55:28,180
The court reporter reads the question back.

3460
02:55:28,180 --> 02:55:29,180
Okay.

3461
02:55:29,180 --> 02:55:30,180
And, uh, ooh.

3462
02:55:30,180 --> 02:55:32,820
What has being Jewish have anything to do with this?

3463
02:55:32,820 --> 02:55:36,700
I'm not here to answer your question today.

3464
02:55:36,700 --> 02:55:38,460
I don't know.

3465
02:55:38,460 --> 02:55:42,420
My answer is my, my personal opinion, I find it unconscionable.

3466
02:55:42,420 --> 02:55:46,260
That's something that I would never bring myself to doing.

3467
02:55:46,260 --> 02:55:50,180
People have open casket funerals every day, don't they?

3468
02:55:50,180 --> 02:55:51,180
Yes.

3469
02:55:51,180 --> 02:55:57,620
However, considering the circumstances and how the child was disfigured based on these

3470
02:55:57,620 --> 02:56:06,060
articles, I find that just horrific.

3471
02:56:06,060 --> 02:56:07,800
Okay.

3472
02:56:07,800 --> 02:56:11,580
So Daria didn't pick up on this, but the reason that Mark brought up the fact that the parent

3473
02:56:11,580 --> 02:56:15,700
is Jewish and decided to have an open casket funeral for her son is because that's a huge

3474
02:56:15,700 --> 02:56:16,700
deal.

3475
02:56:16,700 --> 02:56:20,540
In most Jewish traditions, it's not acceptable to have an open casket funeral.

3476
02:56:20,540 --> 02:56:23,620
Out of respect, it's traditionally understood that you're not supposed to gaze upon the

3477
02:56:23,620 --> 02:56:25,140
face of the deceased.

3478
02:56:25,140 --> 02:56:28,200
The fact that a person of Jewish heritage would make the decision to have an open casket

3479
02:56:28,200 --> 02:56:32,540
funeral because people were saying that her son didn't exist indicates a very strong conviction

3480
02:56:32,540 --> 02:56:37,000
that the world not be allowed to pretend that this didn't happen or try to mentally hide

3481
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:39,060
behind safe images.

3482
02:56:39,060 --> 02:56:43,620
As Veronique, the mother in question, told The Forward, quote, I just want people to

3483
02:56:43,620 --> 02:56:48,460
know the ugliness of it so we don't talk about it abstractly, like these little angels went

3484
02:56:48,460 --> 02:56:49,460
to heaven.

3485
02:56:49,460 --> 02:56:50,460
No, they were butchered.

3486
02:56:50,460 --> 02:56:53,700
They were brutalized, and that's what haunts me at night.

3487
02:56:53,700 --> 02:56:57,260
It's a subtle nuance that's being hinted at in this question that's completely missed

3488
02:56:57,260 --> 02:57:01,020
by Daria, because in preparation for this deposition, it doesn't seem like she's done

3489
02:57:01,020 --> 02:57:02,220
all that much.

3490
02:57:02,220 --> 02:57:07,700
Still, a little better prepared than Rob Doo, but it's impossible to beat that bar.

3491
02:57:07,700 --> 02:57:10,020
You're never going to do worse than him, I don't think.

3492
02:57:10,020 --> 02:57:11,020
Yeah.

3493
02:57:11,020 --> 02:57:12,020
I mean, the worst part is...

3494
02:57:12,020 --> 02:57:13,020
Well, I guess if Rob Doo had shown up drunk.

3495
02:57:13,020 --> 02:57:14,020
That would have been nice.

3496
02:57:14,020 --> 02:57:16,380
That would have been a good day for us.

3497
02:57:16,380 --> 02:57:17,380
Yeah, sorry.

3498
02:57:17,380 --> 02:57:23,180
Well, the strange thing is I believe her, but partially because she's on the other side,

3499
02:57:23,180 --> 02:57:27,660
so she's not going to do that stuff because she knows it won't fucking do a thing.

3500
02:57:27,660 --> 02:57:35,220
I kind of agree with you that I emotionally agree that she is not lying, that she thinks

3501
02:57:35,220 --> 02:57:39,140
that they would do this for political reasons, and if you had a heart you would never do

3502
02:57:39,140 --> 02:57:40,140
that.

3503
02:57:40,140 --> 02:57:41,140
She believes that.

3504
02:57:41,140 --> 02:57:43,980
I don't think that's coming from an analytical place, I think that is an emotional truth.

3505
02:57:43,980 --> 02:57:49,340
Yup, because she knows what somebody would do to somebody who did that.

3506
02:57:49,340 --> 02:57:51,220
It sounds that way to me.

3507
02:57:51,220 --> 02:57:54,860
So we got another article, this is weird.

3508
02:57:54,860 --> 02:57:56,660
Here's another article about that, right?

3509
02:57:56,660 --> 02:57:57,660
Exhibit 1J?

3510
02:57:57,660 --> 02:57:58,660
Yes.

3511
02:57:58,660 --> 02:58:02,940
Okay, so you actually pulled two separate articles about Noah Posner's funeral having

3512
02:58:02,940 --> 02:58:08,820
an open coffin, correct?

3513
02:58:08,820 --> 02:58:13,060
I pulled this one article because it was linked in the Guardian, and I wanted to make sure

3514
02:58:13,060 --> 02:58:17,260
that I have the sources of where I got- I'm thorough, baby!

3515
02:58:17,260 --> 02:58:18,260
Okay.

3516
02:58:18,260 --> 02:58:24,500
And so, of all the documents that you've reviewed regarding the plaintiffs, the only ones you've

3517
02:58:24,500 --> 02:58:28,540
reviewed that you chose to go review were two articles about Mrs. Posner choosing to

3518
02:58:28,540 --> 02:58:35,300
have an open casket for her son, correct?

3519
02:58:35,300 --> 02:58:38,360
That wasn't the reason why I reviewed the article.

3520
02:58:38,360 --> 02:58:40,180
That's not what I'm asking you, Ms. Krapova.

3521
02:58:40,180 --> 02:58:45,580
I'm asking you, of all the documents you reviewed about the plaintiffs before this deposition,

3522
02:58:45,580 --> 02:58:50,420
the only two that you did review are articles that discuss Noah Posner's funeral having

3523
02:58:50,420 --> 02:58:53,960
an open casket, correct?

3524
02:58:53,960 --> 02:58:58,420
They happened to mention that, but that's not the only thing they discussed.

3525
02:58:58,420 --> 02:58:59,420
I'm not saying that.

3526
02:58:59,420 --> 02:59:01,660
I understand what you're saying.

3527
02:59:01,660 --> 02:59:03,380
Let's make it even broader than for you.

3528
02:59:03,380 --> 02:59:08,500
The only two pieces of documentation that you have reviewed for this deposition about

3529
02:59:08,500 --> 02:59:14,780
the plaintiffs are two articles, both of which discuss in the article Noah Posner's open

3530
02:59:14,780 --> 02:59:18,780
casket funeral, correct?

3531
02:59:18,780 --> 02:59:20,300
Yes.

3532
02:59:20,300 --> 02:59:21,300
Okay.

3533
02:59:21,300 --> 02:59:24,780
Tell me any other information from those articles that you believe is relevant to this deposition

3534
02:59:24,780 --> 02:59:27,420
today.

3535
02:59:27,420 --> 02:59:49,420
I've already mentioned that the state of the physical body that the child had for the open

3536
02:59:49,420 --> 02:59:53,020
casket ceremony describes that.

3537
02:59:53,020 --> 02:59:58,060
Okay, so when it comes down to the documents that you reviewed for this deposition about

3538
02:59:58,060 --> 03:00:02,060
the plaintiffs, the only information that you're really gleaning from this that's useful

3539
03:00:02,060 --> 03:00:10,060
to this deposition concerns Noah Posner's open casket and the appearance of his body,

3540
03:00:10,060 --> 03:00:11,380
correct?

3541
03:00:11,380 --> 03:00:14,820
It was useful to some of the points.

3542
03:00:14,820 --> 03:00:17,380
I'm not asking what it's useful for.

3543
03:00:17,380 --> 03:00:20,300
This is bizarre.

3544
03:00:20,300 --> 03:00:29,940
You have Wikipedia articles, Steve and Wolfgang's self-written bios, and multiple articles about

3545
03:00:29,940 --> 03:00:33,140
Noah Posner having an open casket funeral.

3546
03:00:33,140 --> 03:00:34,140
It's upsetting.

3547
03:00:34,140 --> 03:00:41,180
If I was going to subtitle this deposition, it would be, when you say it like that...

3548
03:00:41,180 --> 03:00:46,420
Wait, wait until we get deeper into this.

3549
03:00:46,420 --> 03:00:49,780
Every time she hears something, it's like she hears it for the first time.

3550
03:00:49,780 --> 03:00:57,460
She's like, oh, well, when you put it like that, it sure sounds like I'm an asshole.

3551
03:00:57,460 --> 03:01:00,660
There's some deep bizarreness that is even...

3552
03:01:00,660 --> 03:01:04,260
This is just the amuse-bouche of how bizarre this is going to get.

3553
03:01:04,260 --> 03:01:06,260
This is crazy.

3554
03:01:06,260 --> 03:01:11,220
Mark tries to get into the actual topics that she's there as the corporate representative

3555
03:01:11,220 --> 03:01:15,660
to discuss, and that is a dead end.

3556
03:01:15,660 --> 03:01:21,220
Thought number one is the sourcing and research for the videos described in plaintiff's petitions.

3557
03:01:21,220 --> 03:01:25,860
When was the last time you watched those videos?

3558
03:01:25,860 --> 03:01:30,380
Back up.

3559
03:01:30,380 --> 03:01:31,380
Made an assumption there.

3560
03:01:31,380 --> 03:01:34,260
Have you watched the videos in plaintiff's petition?

3561
03:01:34,260 --> 03:01:38,500
Ever in your history of it before?

3562
03:01:38,500 --> 03:01:40,620
I've watched some of them.

3563
03:01:40,620 --> 03:01:41,620
What?

3564
03:01:41,620 --> 03:01:42,620
Okay.

3565
03:01:42,620 --> 03:01:54,300
So, one thing we can say is that in preparation for this deposition, you didn't watch those

3566
03:01:54,300 --> 03:01:57,260
videos, correct?

3567
03:01:57,260 --> 03:01:58,260
I'm sorry.

3568
03:01:58,260 --> 03:02:02,220
Ms. Karpov, is that a difficult question for you to answer?

3569
03:02:02,220 --> 03:02:05,300
Well, I've already answered some of the videos.

3570
03:02:05,300 --> 03:02:06,300
Right.

3571
03:02:06,300 --> 03:02:10,780
No, I understand that you have in your history at Infowars since 2015, you've probably on

3572
03:02:10,780 --> 03:02:12,740
occasion seen some of these videos.

3573
03:02:12,740 --> 03:02:13,740
I understand that.

3574
03:02:13,740 --> 03:02:16,900
What I'm asking you is since the date you were told you were given this deposition in

3575
03:02:16,900 --> 03:02:20,820
November and you were preparing for this deposition, you haven't watched any of these videos, right?

3576
03:02:20,820 --> 03:02:21,820
I have not.

3577
03:02:21,820 --> 03:02:22,820
Okay.

3578
03:02:22,820 --> 03:02:23,820
Ooh.

3579
03:02:23,820 --> 03:02:30,700
So, this is a bad start because you now know that you're not going to really even be familiar

3580
03:02:30,700 --> 03:02:32,300
with the videos in question.

3581
03:02:32,300 --> 03:02:33,300
Right.

3582
03:02:33,300 --> 03:02:34,300
Right.

3583
03:02:34,300 --> 03:02:35,300
Right.

3584
03:02:35,300 --> 03:02:36,300
Right.

3585
03:02:36,300 --> 03:02:37,300
And that is kind of limiting.

3586
03:02:37,300 --> 03:02:38,300
Yeah.

3587
03:02:38,300 --> 03:02:39,300
Is your ability to testify as a corporate representative.

3588
03:02:39,300 --> 03:02:40,300
Yeah.

3589
03:02:40,300 --> 03:02:46,380
So, once we've established here that she hasn't watched these videos in preparation, it turns

3590
03:02:46,380 --> 03:02:52,020
out that also that by extension, that means she doesn't even know what they say.

3591
03:02:52,020 --> 03:02:59,180
Do you see that paragraph 14 identifies a January 27th, 2013 video entitled, Why People

3592
03:02:59,180 --> 03:03:01,500
Think Sandy Hook is a Hoax?

3593
03:03:01,500 --> 03:03:02,500
Yes.

3594
03:03:02,500 --> 03:03:03,500
Okay.

3595
03:03:03,500 --> 03:03:07,540
You're familiar with the claims made in that video, right?

3596
03:03:07,540 --> 03:03:15,340
In what form?

3597
03:03:15,340 --> 03:03:17,980
I don't recall the exact video.

3598
03:03:17,980 --> 03:03:23,460
And so, sitting here today, you're not familiar with the claims made in that video?

3599
03:03:23,460 --> 03:03:24,460
No.

3600
03:03:24,460 --> 03:03:25,460
Okay.

3601
03:03:25,460 --> 03:03:32,740
And because of this, so much of the questions that are being asked end up being like her

3602
03:03:32,740 --> 03:03:33,740
guessing.

3603
03:03:33,740 --> 03:03:34,740
I don't know.

3604
03:03:34,740 --> 03:03:35,740
You know, like what are the sources for this?

3605
03:03:35,740 --> 03:03:41,700
Like, I assume that it's Wolfgang Halbig, or I have an educated guess that it's this

3606
03:03:41,700 --> 03:03:42,700
person.

3607
03:03:42,700 --> 03:03:43,700
Right.

3608
03:03:43,700 --> 03:03:44,700
Right.

3609
03:03:44,700 --> 03:03:47,780
And then Mark will push back about like, what did you do to try and figure out, if anything,

3610
03:03:47,780 --> 03:03:48,860
who made this video?

3611
03:03:48,860 --> 03:03:49,860
Who worked on this?

3612
03:03:49,860 --> 03:03:50,860
What are the sources?

3613
03:03:50,860 --> 03:03:51,860
Yeah.

3614
03:03:51,860 --> 03:03:52,860
And she's like, well, nothing.

3615
03:03:52,860 --> 03:03:53,860
It's okay.

3616
03:03:53,860 --> 03:03:58,180
I mean, how did they pick who shows up for...

3617
03:03:58,180 --> 03:04:01,140
Did they throw a dart or something?

3618
03:04:01,140 --> 03:04:02,140
What is happening?

3619
03:04:02,140 --> 03:04:10,980
I think there's an Infowars elder who goes into a trance and then they choose somebody.

3620
03:04:10,980 --> 03:04:11,980
Bananas.

3621
03:04:11,980 --> 03:04:12,980
Yeah.

3622
03:04:12,980 --> 03:04:17,900
The confidence with which you would walk into what amounts to the end of your professional

3623
03:04:17,900 --> 03:04:18,900
career.

3624
03:04:18,900 --> 03:04:25,660
So we're going to skip a bunch of the back and forth of just like, who did this?

3625
03:04:25,660 --> 03:04:27,100
I don't know.

3626
03:04:27,100 --> 03:04:28,100
Probably Wolfgang.

3627
03:04:28,100 --> 03:04:29,100
Probably Wolfgang.

3628
03:04:29,100 --> 03:04:30,100
And there's a lot of it.

3629
03:04:30,100 --> 03:04:31,100
Yeah.

3630
03:04:31,100 --> 03:04:32,100
Yeah.

3631
03:04:32,100 --> 03:04:33,100
Because it's not relevant.

3632
03:04:33,100 --> 03:04:34,100
It definitely is.

3633
03:04:34,100 --> 03:04:35,100
Oh, totally.

3634
03:04:35,100 --> 03:04:39,820
And it paints the picture of how unprepared she was for this deposition and the lack of

3635
03:04:39,820 --> 03:04:43,180
respect that's being shown to the process.

3636
03:04:43,180 --> 03:04:48,420
But in terms of, we're doing a show also, and I think it would get grating in much the

3637
03:04:48,420 --> 03:04:50,900
same way it was clearly in the room.

3638
03:04:50,900 --> 03:04:51,900
Yeah.

3639
03:04:51,900 --> 03:04:52,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3640
03:04:52,900 --> 03:04:58,540
So we're going to jump to a question about the Super Bowl pick.

3641
03:04:58,540 --> 03:04:59,540
Right.

3642
03:04:59,540 --> 03:05:02,900
So this is the pick that Alex was asked about.

3643
03:05:02,900 --> 03:05:08,600
It's a Wolfgang Halbig sent it to Nico and we couldn't determine whether or not Alex

3644
03:05:08,600 --> 03:05:11,840
should answer if this is crazy.

3645
03:05:11,840 --> 03:05:14,500
Actually he did say it was crazy.

3646
03:05:14,500 --> 03:05:18,020
Here is Mark beginning to bring this up to Daria.

3647
03:05:18,020 --> 03:05:19,020
All right.

3648
03:05:19,020 --> 03:05:20,020
So I'm just trying to make sure.

3649
03:05:20,020 --> 03:05:21,020
Have you seen this document?

3650
03:05:21,020 --> 03:05:29,020
I don't recall reading this particular exchange with Mr. Halbig and Nico.

3651
03:05:29,020 --> 03:05:30,020
Okay.

3652
03:05:30,020 --> 03:05:32,780
I'm going to start at the bottom here.

3653
03:05:32,780 --> 03:05:45,860
And this is, this document that I'm reading from you is marked FSS Texas, FSSTX-039429.

3654
03:05:45,860 --> 03:05:50,420
And you will see at the bottom email, Mr. Halbig writes to Nico.

3655
03:05:50,420 --> 03:05:53,420
Do you know who Nathaniel Foulkes is, the person he copies?

3656
03:05:53,420 --> 03:05:54,420
No.

3657
03:05:54,420 --> 03:05:55,420
Okay.

3658
03:05:55,420 --> 03:05:57,700
Nico, though, is an Infowars employee.

3659
03:05:57,700 --> 03:05:58,700
Yes.

3660
03:05:58,700 --> 03:05:59,700
Do you know who he is?

3661
03:05:59,700 --> 03:06:00,700
I don't know.

3662
03:06:00,700 --> 03:06:03,700
He's not employed by FSS.

3663
03:06:03,700 --> 03:06:04,700
At this time?

3664
03:06:04,700 --> 03:06:13,780
Oh, at this time he would be the head producer.

3665
03:06:13,780 --> 03:06:15,580
Nico is no longer employed by Infowars?

3666
03:06:15,580 --> 03:06:16,580
Correct.

3667
03:06:16,580 --> 03:06:20,500
Does Infowars possess his last known contact information?

3668
03:06:20,500 --> 03:06:22,700
Yes.

3669
03:06:22,700 --> 03:06:25,460
Okay.

3670
03:06:25,460 --> 03:06:31,060
Mr. Halbig in this email states, Nico, the picture of the Sandy Hook Elementary School

3671
03:06:31,060 --> 03:06:33,780
Choir is one of the keys.

3672
03:06:33,780 --> 03:06:36,100
Other pictures are great for discussion.

3673
03:06:36,100 --> 03:06:39,060
These are the CT crime pictures.

3674
03:06:39,060 --> 03:06:40,060
Wolf.

3675
03:06:40,060 --> 03:06:42,060
I've read that correctly?

3676
03:06:42,060 --> 03:06:43,060
Yes.

3677
03:06:43,060 --> 03:06:44,060
Okay.

3678
03:06:44,060 --> 03:06:46,700
Nico responds and says, got the Super Bowl picture.

3679
03:06:46,700 --> 03:06:48,020
Thank you for sending.

3680
03:06:48,020 --> 03:06:52,140
We will be having, we will be calling you on Skype at 1 p.m. Eastern Time.

3681
03:06:52,140 --> 03:06:54,340
How long will you be available for the interview today?

3682
03:06:54,340 --> 03:06:55,340
Thanks, Nico.

3683
03:06:55,340 --> 03:06:56,340
I've read that correctly?

3684
03:06:56,340 --> 03:06:57,340
Yes.

3685
03:06:57,340 --> 03:06:58,340
Okay.

3686
03:06:58,340 --> 03:07:00,980
And then the final email says, as long as you and Alex can put up with me, Wolfgang.

3687
03:07:00,980 --> 03:07:01,980
I've read that correctly.

3688
03:07:01,980 --> 03:07:02,980
Yes.

3689
03:07:02,980 --> 03:07:03,980
Okay.

3690
03:07:03,980 --> 03:07:07,300
Does this help you refresh your memory about what the Super Bowl picture is?

3691
03:07:07,300 --> 03:07:09,420
So we've got the topic introduced.

3692
03:07:09,420 --> 03:07:13,540
We have Nico's response to getting the Super Bowl picture.

3693
03:07:13,540 --> 03:07:18,500
I will say, though, if I can say one positive thing about Wolfgang Halbig, it's that sometimes

3694
03:07:18,500 --> 03:07:20,460
he signs off his emails, wolf.

3695
03:07:20,460 --> 03:07:21,460
Ooh, that's not bad.

3696
03:07:21,460 --> 03:07:22,860
Yeah, but it's not consistent.

3697
03:07:22,860 --> 03:07:24,420
Eh, yeah, I know.

3698
03:07:24,420 --> 03:07:27,980
I think if my name was Wolfgang, I'd be constantly making people call me wolf.

3699
03:07:27,980 --> 03:07:28,980
I don't know.

3700
03:07:28,980 --> 03:07:31,180
Sometimes you sign your emails Dutch, don't you?

3701
03:07:31,180 --> 03:07:32,860
No, I don't.

3702
03:07:32,860 --> 03:07:35,660
So we get to talking about the Super Bowl pick itself.

3703
03:07:35,660 --> 03:07:36,660
Uh-huh.

3704
03:07:36,660 --> 03:07:46,180
This, oh God, this is, I don't even, I'm having trouble figuring out how to prepare

3705
03:07:46,180 --> 03:07:48,860
you for how insane what's coming up is.

3706
03:07:48,860 --> 03:07:49,860
I can't be prepared.

3707
03:07:49,860 --> 03:07:50,860
Oof.

3708
03:07:50,860 --> 03:07:54,580
All right, I'm going to show you how to mark his exhibit five.

3709
03:07:54,580 --> 03:08:01,820
You take a look at that picture for me.

3710
03:08:01,820 --> 03:08:06,580
Do you see at the bottom corner where it says FSS TX.04?

3711
03:08:06,580 --> 03:08:07,580
Yes.

3712
03:08:07,580 --> 03:08:08,580
476?

3713
03:08:08,580 --> 03:08:09,580
Yes.

3714
03:08:09,580 --> 03:08:10,580
Okay.

3715
03:08:10,580 --> 03:08:13,580
Have you seen this picture before?

3716
03:08:13,580 --> 03:08:16,980
Personally, I have not.

3717
03:08:16,980 --> 03:08:18,420
Okay.

3718
03:08:18,420 --> 03:08:22,260
This was a document though, you can tell from the number at the bottom, that was produced

3719
03:08:22,260 --> 03:08:24,260
by the company, correct?

3720
03:08:24,260 --> 03:08:25,260
Yes.

3721
03:08:25,260 --> 03:08:26,260
Okay.

3722
03:08:26,260 --> 03:08:30,740
Can you read what it says at the very top of the picture, the white text?

3723
03:08:30,740 --> 03:08:34,340
Ten Sandy Hook children found alive and well.

3724
03:08:34,340 --> 03:08:35,340
Okay.

3725
03:08:35,340 --> 03:08:42,620
This, um, does the company now admit that this picture is, um, outrageous?

3726
03:08:42,620 --> 03:08:43,620
Objection form.

3727
03:08:43,620 --> 03:08:44,620
Yeah, my turn.

3728
03:08:44,620 --> 03:08:51,740
Hey, listen, listen, it's been a long fucking trial and you guys have been dicks.

3729
03:08:51,740 --> 03:08:54,580
Are you ready to admit that this is outrageous?

3730
03:08:54,580 --> 03:08:59,300
Excuse me, uh, are you ready to say you're full of shit, neener, neener, neener, go fuck

3731
03:08:59,300 --> 03:09:00,300
yourself?

3732
03:09:00,300 --> 03:09:04,340
Um, yeah, so apparently this is, this is, this is worth an objection.

3733
03:09:04,340 --> 03:09:05,340
Yeah.

3734
03:09:05,340 --> 03:09:06,340
But it, it deteriorates.

3735
03:09:06,340 --> 03:09:11,740
Well, what I'm saying is if there's an expert and you've been relying on him, guy's supposed

3736
03:09:11,740 --> 03:09:14,940
to be a school safety shooting expert, whatever it is, right?

3737
03:09:14,940 --> 03:09:16,500
You're relying on it.

3738
03:09:16,500 --> 03:09:22,060
And then just hypothetically, that person just starts saying absolutely crazy things

3739
03:09:22,060 --> 03:09:24,560
and it's pretty clear they're going off their rocker.

3740
03:09:24,560 --> 03:09:28,180
Maybe they were even credible at one time, but suddenly they start saying a bunch of

3741
03:09:28,180 --> 03:09:34,420
crazy things to the company when it's deciding whether to put stuff on about Sandy Hook,

3742
03:09:34,420 --> 03:09:40,260
it needs to, it should consider whether what the things it's expert is saying are crazy,

3743
03:09:40,260 --> 03:09:41,260
correct?

3744
03:09:41,260 --> 03:09:46,940
Well, if he's the expert on the subject matter and who knows a lot more on the subject than

3745
03:09:46,940 --> 03:09:54,220
any of us working at free speech systems, it would be reasonable to believe that we

3746
03:09:54,220 --> 03:10:00,140
would want to listen what, what consider what, what the information that he's bringing.

3747
03:10:00,140 --> 03:10:05,740
What exactly in Wolfgang Halbig's history and expertise makes him an expert that you

3748
03:10:05,740 --> 03:10:11,800
should defer to on whether this picture of the Super Bowl choir is actually pictures

3749
03:10:11,800 --> 03:10:13,220
of children who were murdered?

3750
03:10:13,220 --> 03:10:14,480
Well, that's a good question.

3751
03:10:14,480 --> 03:10:17,420
That's why I brought his bio, which I would like to read.

3752
03:10:17,420 --> 03:10:18,420
No.

3753
03:10:18,420 --> 03:10:21,300
You'd just like to read the record or what?

3754
03:10:21,300 --> 03:10:22,300
No.

3755
03:10:22,300 --> 03:10:23,300
Wild.

3756
03:10:23,300 --> 03:10:24,300
No.

3757
03:10:24,300 --> 03:10:25,300
Wild.

3758
03:10:25,300 --> 03:10:26,300
No.

3759
03:10:26,300 --> 03:10:27,860
So one of the things I think is really interesting that's going on there is that like Dory is

3760
03:10:27,860 --> 03:10:29,460
essentially appealing to authority.

3761
03:10:29,460 --> 03:10:30,460
Yeah.

3762
03:10:30,460 --> 03:10:34,420
You know, like just being like, well, Wolfgang said so and he's the expert on things.

3763
03:10:34,420 --> 03:10:36,860
No, that, that was like, really?

3764
03:10:36,860 --> 03:10:38,180
You're going to, you're going to tell me.

3765
03:10:38,180 --> 03:10:43,280
If the expert says crazy things, they're not crazy because this person's the expert.

3766
03:10:43,280 --> 03:10:47,820
Those things by being said by this person become credible.

3767
03:10:47,820 --> 03:10:48,820
That's weird.

3768
03:10:48,820 --> 03:10:49,820
Okay.

3769
03:10:49,820 --> 03:10:54,960
So what you're telling me is that the editorial standard for Info Wars is if somebody was

3770
03:10:54,960 --> 03:10:58,540
an expert, we would believe them.

3771
03:10:58,540 --> 03:11:00,540
Can we even qualify that further?

3772
03:11:00,540 --> 03:11:01,540
That's a good point.

3773
03:11:01,540 --> 03:11:02,660
If they claim to be an expert.

3774
03:11:02,660 --> 03:11:03,660
There we are.

3775
03:11:03,660 --> 03:11:04,660
Yes.

3776
03:11:04,660 --> 03:11:05,660
So before we even get to expert.

3777
03:11:05,660 --> 03:11:10,220
If you make up credentials for yourself that are really impressive, you get to just do

3778
03:11:10,220 --> 03:11:11,220
whatever you want.

3779
03:11:11,220 --> 03:11:12,220
Yeah.

3780
03:11:12,220 --> 03:11:17,060
So you're telling me that the tip of the spear against disinformation from the mainstream

3781
03:11:17,060 --> 03:11:18,060
media.

3782
03:11:18,060 --> 03:11:19,060
They do a lot of background work.

3783
03:11:19,060 --> 03:11:21,420
The people who work 11 hours a day.

3784
03:11:21,420 --> 03:11:26,460
Oh, Alex is up until five in the morning sometimes always researching.

3785
03:11:26,460 --> 03:11:29,100
You're telling me that you don't need to verify any of that shit on your own?

3786
03:11:29,100 --> 03:11:30,100
No, no.

3787
03:11:30,100 --> 03:11:31,100
Cause this guy's an expert.

3788
03:11:31,100 --> 03:11:32,100
Fair enough.

3789
03:11:32,100 --> 03:11:37,420
So Mark wants to know if this picture of the Super Bowl choir that was sent to Nico was

3790
03:11:37,420 --> 03:11:40,180
made by a sane person.

3791
03:11:40,180 --> 03:11:46,400
You admit sitting here right now, this was not created by a rational, sane human being.

3792
03:11:46,400 --> 03:11:54,220
Or are you going to tell this jury that this is created by a rational, sane human being?

3793
03:11:54,220 --> 03:11:56,860
I don't have an opinion, a personal opinion on it.

3794
03:11:56,860 --> 03:12:01,540
So you see this picture and then trying to determine whether it was created by a sane

3795
03:12:01,540 --> 03:12:03,060
rational human being.

3796
03:12:03,060 --> 03:12:06,340
You look at it and go, I have no strong feelings either way.

3797
03:12:06,340 --> 03:12:07,340
Correct?

3798
03:12:07,340 --> 03:12:14,380
I'm not a psychiatric medical expert to determine who is sane and who isn't.

3799
03:12:14,380 --> 03:12:16,020
That is quite a, quite a response.

3800
03:12:16,020 --> 03:12:17,020
Ooh boy.

3801
03:12:17,020 --> 03:12:20,900
I mean, you know, listen, Goldwater rule.

3802
03:12:20,900 --> 03:12:21,900
What are you going to do?

3803
03:12:21,900 --> 03:12:25,300
I guess there's really no way around that from like a questioning perspective really

3804
03:12:25,300 --> 03:12:30,260
like of like, yeah, you, I guess you aren't, but you're just trying to dodge the question

3805
03:12:30,260 --> 03:12:31,740
of like, it's very clear.

3806
03:12:31,740 --> 03:12:35,660
If you look at this, you'd be like, this is well, as Mark said, outrageous.

3807
03:12:35,660 --> 03:12:41,380
No, I mean, there's the problem with this little chunk right here is, uh, we're in a

3808
03:12:41,380 --> 03:12:47,380
situation where the rules are such that you can't, Mark can't be like, Hey, listen, you

3809
03:12:47,380 --> 03:12:51,300
know, and she can't be like, I know, but you know, right.

3810
03:12:51,300 --> 03:12:55,180
And he can't be like, well, yeah, no, I know why she just level with me for a second.

3811
03:12:55,180 --> 03:12:56,180
Right?

3812
03:12:56,180 --> 03:12:58,040
I mean, they both, everybody knows what's going on.

3813
03:12:58,040 --> 03:13:02,560
This is so infuriating to me is because Mark knows she's full of shit and she knows she's

3814
03:13:02,560 --> 03:13:03,560
full of shit.

3815
03:13:03,560 --> 03:13:04,560
Now I agree.

3816
03:13:04,560 --> 03:13:07,760
I agree that that is a frustrating, frustrating now.

3817
03:13:07,760 --> 03:13:08,760
Listen to me.

3818
03:13:08,760 --> 03:13:09,760
Yeah.

3819
03:13:09,760 --> 03:13:10,760
That dynamic breaks.

3820
03:13:10,760 --> 03:13:11,760
Okay.

3821
03:13:11,760 --> 03:13:12,760
The status quo changes.

3822
03:13:12,760 --> 03:13:13,760
That's good.

3823
03:13:13,760 --> 03:13:14,760
That's good.

3824
03:13:14,760 --> 03:13:19,020
In the midst of this conversation about whether or not a sane person would make this, this

3825
03:13:19,020 --> 03:13:23,740
a Superbowl picture and Oh my God.

3826
03:13:23,740 --> 03:13:26,480
You would, if somebody sent you this while you were doing reporting, you would thank

3827
03:13:26,480 --> 03:13:28,740
them for it?

3828
03:13:28,740 --> 03:13:29,740
I don't know.

3829
03:13:29,740 --> 03:13:30,740
It depends on the circumstances.

3830
03:13:30,740 --> 03:13:31,740
Okay.

3831
03:13:31,740 --> 03:13:37,060
Well, the circumstances there, when Nico was having this exchange, what information we

3832
03:13:37,060 --> 03:13:38,060
had at the time.

3833
03:13:38,060 --> 03:13:39,060
You're the representative of my business.

3834
03:13:39,060 --> 03:13:43,960
Well, I'm asking you, what if you had this information, a picture that says at the top

3835
03:13:43,960 --> 03:13:49,300
10 Sandy Hook children found alive and well, and then the Superbowl choir from millions

3836
03:13:49,300 --> 03:13:55,580
of people, would you look at that and go, man, I'm glad that he sent me that.

3837
03:13:55,580 --> 03:14:07,260
Actually, I would rather think that those kids were alive than don't then having, because

3838
03:14:07,260 --> 03:14:14,340
do it tragedy of being murdered for no reason.

3839
03:14:14,340 --> 03:14:21,340
The innocence of those children who didn't deserve what that, that kind of fate, I would

3840
03:14:21,340 --> 03:14:31,940
hold out hope to the last bit of my soul, hoping and praying that that picture was that

3841
03:14:31,940 --> 03:14:36,860
that was something that be possible for those kids to be alive.

3842
03:14:36,860 --> 03:14:37,860
Whoa.

3843
03:14:37,860 --> 03:14:38,860
Whoa.

3844
03:14:38,860 --> 03:14:44,900
In if, if, if, if I saw that picture and then ask somebody a question about that picture

3845
03:14:44,900 --> 03:14:48,700
and then they gave me that response, I would throw a table through the wall.

3846
03:14:48,700 --> 03:14:50,220
I almost gasped.

3847
03:14:50,220 --> 03:14:52,500
That is fucking crazy.

3848
03:14:52,500 --> 03:14:53,500
Really.

3849
03:14:53,500 --> 03:14:56,940
It's such a bizarre response to the questioning over the Superbowl picture and it's not even

3850
03:14:56,940 --> 03:14:59,180
relevant to the question she was being asked.

3851
03:14:59,180 --> 03:15:03,940
This is volunteered of her own desire to express this.

3852
03:15:03,940 --> 03:15:04,940
Okay.

3853
03:15:04,940 --> 03:15:08,980
Now it's, it's really hard to understand this mentality unless you recognize that people

3854
03:15:08,980 --> 03:15:13,060
like Daria, and I would assume most of the people at Infowars don't ascribe to the rules

3855
03:15:13,060 --> 03:15:18,220
of reality with things like cause and effect or object permanence in her mind, choosing

3856
03:15:18,220 --> 03:15:22,140
to believe that the kids who were killed at Sandy Hook are actually secretly in the choir

3857
03:15:22,140 --> 03:15:23,220
at the Superbowl.

3858
03:15:23,220 --> 03:15:28,260
That's an optimistic idea because the alternative is choosing to believe that the kids are dead.

3859
03:15:28,260 --> 03:15:29,900
There's so many problems with this idea.

3860
03:15:29,900 --> 03:15:33,380
I mean, the most obvious being that what she's describing is essentially just living in a

3861
03:15:33,380 --> 03:15:38,780
fantasy world because reality is too tough, but also she seems to be ignoring how this

3862
03:15:38,780 --> 03:15:40,300
isn't an isolated thing.

3863
03:15:40,300 --> 03:15:44,060
Like if the kids at Sandy Hook were secretly in that choir, the implications of that are

3864
03:15:44,060 --> 03:15:48,500
horrific and I don't, I don't know if this would actually be an optimistic scenario.

3865
03:15:48,500 --> 03:15:51,660
No, it'd be the worst case possible fucking scenario that I've ever been.

3866
03:15:51,660 --> 03:15:55,500
If the government had just pulled off a massive false flag and then they were rubbing it in

3867
03:15:55,500 --> 03:16:01,380
by having the fake kids sing at the Superbowl, I suspect those kids would not live past halftime.

3868
03:16:01,380 --> 03:16:03,680
These are the people who work for the literal devil.

3869
03:16:03,680 --> 03:16:05,180
They're not above that shit.

3870
03:16:05,180 --> 03:16:09,040
I find it hard to believe that if the globalists did something like this, they would just leave

3871
03:16:09,040 --> 03:16:11,380
those loose hanging threads out there.

3872
03:16:11,380 --> 03:16:16,860
I mean, for your response to that question to just be like, you know, I choose hope and

3873
03:16:16,860 --> 03:16:21,020
it's just fucking go, go, get out of here.

3874
03:16:21,020 --> 03:16:26,700
So when I heard Daria say that I thought, well, this trip has been worth it.

3875
03:16:26,700 --> 03:16:30,780
I had heard something that was completely unpredictable.

3876
03:16:30,780 --> 03:16:33,140
That was something I never expected I would hear.

3877
03:16:33,140 --> 03:16:35,820
And then it actually even goes on.

3878
03:16:35,820 --> 03:16:41,540
So if you think about it from your point of view, if you think about it, if the parents

3879
03:16:41,540 --> 03:16:46,980
of my clients saw this picture, it should give them a lot of hope, right?

3880
03:16:46,980 --> 03:16:50,380
They should react really positively to this with a lot of hope inside, right?

3881
03:16:50,380 --> 03:16:51,380
Objection form.

3882
03:16:51,380 --> 03:16:54,540
Is that what you're saying?

3883
03:16:54,540 --> 03:16:55,540
I'm not those parents.

3884
03:16:55,540 --> 03:17:01,100
I'm looking at it as an outsider and I would much rather, and I don't know a person with

3885
03:17:01,100 --> 03:17:08,100
a heart would rather think, would rather believe that the kids are dead versus that the kids

3886
03:17:08,100 --> 03:17:09,660
might be alive.

3887
03:17:09,660 --> 03:17:16,300
I would say it's reasonable for a person with a heart to have that sort of optimism as it's

3888
03:17:16,300 --> 03:17:22,060
as I'm, I'm sure Alex wanted to believe that those kids, if there was any possibility that

3889
03:17:22,060 --> 03:17:27,660
the kids were not dead, then he was going to grab onto it because that's a much better

3890
03:17:27,660 --> 03:17:35,740
proposition to have in your heart and mind then to, to realize that they weren't.

3891
03:17:35,740 --> 03:17:44,980
So Alex Jones, according to how the company views things in terms of your Sandy Hook coverage,

3892
03:17:44,980 --> 03:17:51,220
Alex Jones said the kids didn't really die and they were really alive in part because

3893
03:17:51,220 --> 03:17:55,860
he has such a big heart and a lot of hope and optimism, correct?

3894
03:17:55,860 --> 03:17:56,860
Objection form.

3895
03:17:56,860 --> 03:18:01,860
If you might not have heard it because the lawyer was talking, but she said yes.

3896
03:18:01,860 --> 03:18:03,340
That's truly bizarre.

3897
03:18:03,340 --> 03:18:05,580
And remember, this is somebody testifying as a corporate representative.

3898
03:18:05,580 --> 03:18:09,060
Yeah, I was going to say, that's something that's really important to remind people here.

3899
03:18:09,060 --> 03:18:13,660
She's there in an official capacity and still decided to take a very ill-advised swing at

3900
03:18:13,660 --> 03:18:17,700
trying to pretend that spreading Sandy Hook conspiracies was actually an act of kindness.

3901
03:18:17,700 --> 03:18:22,940
Listen, the editorial position of Info Wars and Free Speech Systems is that not only was

3902
03:18:22,940 --> 03:18:29,680
Santa real in Miracle on 34th street, he is real outside of Miracle on the 34th street.

3903
03:18:29,680 --> 03:18:33,120
If I were Mark, I would have kept pressing on this line of thought to really determine

3904
03:18:33,120 --> 03:18:36,560
if Daria thinks that her beliefs somehow affect world events.

3905
03:18:36,560 --> 03:18:40,320
Like if she believes that her thinking that the kids were alive has any bearing on whether

3906
03:18:40,320 --> 03:18:45,100
or not they are actually alive or dead from these comments, I am not sure.

3907
03:18:45,100 --> 03:18:48,540
I mean, I, you know, that's the weird thing that I'm getting right now.

3908
03:18:48,540 --> 03:18:54,940
I was so quick to believe her earlier whenever she said that she wouldn't do that stuff,

3909
03:18:54,940 --> 03:19:00,560
because I do believe that she does think that if you were, that you would never engage with

3910
03:19:00,560 --> 03:19:04,980
conspiracy theorists if your kid dies, because it won't matter either way.

3911
03:19:04,980 --> 03:19:06,540
Like that makes sense to me.

3912
03:19:06,540 --> 03:19:13,260
She's saying this with the same tone of like emotional honesty, and this is batshit crazy.

3913
03:19:13,260 --> 03:19:20,220
Yes, there are a couple moments where you get that outside of the, I don't know, like

3914
03:19:20,220 --> 03:19:24,060
answers about sources, and I didn't do anything to prepare for this.

3915
03:19:24,060 --> 03:19:28,760
Like this, that moment, those two of the moments that are like, that are like really stand

3916
03:19:28,760 --> 03:19:29,940
out.

3917
03:19:29,940 --> 03:19:33,060
And I think this one is particularly upsetting.

3918
03:19:33,060 --> 03:19:34,060
It's very upsetting.

3919
03:19:34,060 --> 03:19:38,260
And I think the point that Mark brings up about like, oh, my clients should love this

3920
03:19:38,260 --> 03:19:40,360
picture that it should give them hope.

3921
03:19:40,360 --> 03:19:48,500
Like the fact that she can't register or refuses to register, that's obviously, it makes her

3922
03:19:48,500 --> 03:19:52,740
idea look absurd, because of course the parents are furious.

3923
03:19:52,740 --> 03:19:53,740
Right, right, right.

3924
03:19:53,740 --> 03:19:55,300
So here's the dumb thing you said.

3925
03:19:55,300 --> 03:19:59,660
I'm going to take it to a logical endpoint, and now you're going to see that it's dumb.

3926
03:19:59,660 --> 03:20:02,860
And she's like, well, I would rather die than see that it's dumb.

3927
03:20:02,860 --> 03:20:07,140
And actually I find it much more comfortable to live in this dumb place.

3928
03:20:07,140 --> 03:20:08,140
Exactly.

3929
03:20:08,140 --> 03:20:09,140
Yeah.

3930
03:20:09,140 --> 03:20:10,140
Congratulations.

3931
03:20:10,140 --> 03:20:15,740
If you have a heart, how could you not believe that I am writing a unicorn home after we

3932
03:20:15,740 --> 03:20:16,740
record this show?

3933
03:20:16,740 --> 03:20:18,860
If you have a heart.

3934
03:20:18,860 --> 03:20:22,060
There is also this focus of like having a heart.

3935
03:20:22,060 --> 03:20:24,100
Having a, just have a heart, Dan.

3936
03:20:24,100 --> 03:20:25,100
It is weird.

3937
03:20:25,100 --> 03:20:29,660
Sure, we've harassed and destroyed many people's lives, but that's because we have a heart,

3938
03:20:29,660 --> 03:20:30,660
Dan.

3939
03:20:30,660 --> 03:20:31,660
Right.

3940
03:20:31,660 --> 03:20:33,860
It's for the good of hearts.

3941
03:20:33,860 --> 03:20:38,540
All of you lawyers trying to get some sort of remuneration for these Sandy Hook families

3942
03:20:38,540 --> 03:20:44,220
that we've badgered and horrifically fucked with for the past 10 years or whatever it

3943
03:20:44,220 --> 03:20:45,220
is.

3944
03:20:45,220 --> 03:20:46,220
Those people.

3945
03:20:46,220 --> 03:20:50,740
You should call Info Wars Cheerios because it's heart healthy, heart friendly.

3946
03:20:50,740 --> 03:20:51,880
All right.

3947
03:20:51,880 --> 03:20:56,320
So Daria, there's more questions that you can't answer about sourcing and stuff.

3948
03:20:56,320 --> 03:21:03,020
And so they end up taking a break and this is where I was like, oh my God.

3949
03:21:03,020 --> 03:21:05,700
There's just a recognition that like she is in trouble.

3950
03:21:05,700 --> 03:21:11,180
You see there it's talking about an April 22nd, 2017 video called Sandy Hook Vampires

3951
03:21:11,180 --> 03:21:12,180
Exposed.

3952
03:21:12,180 --> 03:21:13,180
Yes.

3953
03:21:13,180 --> 03:21:16,420
You understand that that is the video that Mr. Posner and Mrs. De La Rosa based their

3954
03:21:16,420 --> 03:21:19,060
defamation claim on?

3955
03:21:19,060 --> 03:21:21,060
Did you know that?

3956
03:21:21,060 --> 03:21:22,660
Okay.

3957
03:21:22,660 --> 03:21:24,140
Did you know that?

3958
03:21:24,140 --> 03:21:26,300
When preparing for this depo, did you know that?

3959
03:21:26,300 --> 03:21:27,300
Yes.

3960
03:21:27,300 --> 03:21:28,300
Okay.

3961
03:21:28,300 --> 03:21:34,500
Did you watch that video?

3962
03:21:34,500 --> 03:21:38,780
I mean, unless you've watched it in the last couple of hours, you haven't watched it, right?

3963
03:21:38,780 --> 03:21:39,780
For this deposition?

3964
03:21:39,780 --> 03:21:42,060
I'm familiar with the video.

3965
03:21:42,060 --> 03:21:45,100
Did you watch it in preparing for this deposition though?

3966
03:21:45,100 --> 03:21:48,220
Yes, I believe so.

3967
03:21:48,220 --> 03:21:49,220
Okay.

3968
03:21:49,220 --> 03:21:53,220
When did you watch it?

3969
03:21:53,220 --> 03:21:54,220
Earlier today when?

3970
03:21:54,220 --> 03:21:55,220
During the break.

3971
03:21:55,220 --> 03:21:59,420
Oh, so during the break, when it became apparent that you hadn't watched these videos, you

3972
03:21:59,420 --> 03:22:00,740
went and tried to watch this video.

3973
03:22:00,740 --> 03:22:01,740
Yes.

3974
03:22:01,740 --> 03:22:03,740
You didn't watch the whole thing though, did you?

3975
03:22:03,740 --> 03:22:04,740
No.

3976
03:22:04,740 --> 03:22:06,740
Because it's a 45 minute video, right?

3977
03:22:06,740 --> 03:22:08,220
It's a lengthy video.

3978
03:22:08,220 --> 03:22:10,420
Yeah, so you didn't watch this video.

3979
03:22:10,420 --> 03:22:13,580
You watched pieces of this video, correct?

3980
03:22:13,580 --> 03:22:14,580
Correct.

3981
03:22:14,580 --> 03:22:15,580
How many pieces did you watch?

3982
03:22:15,580 --> 03:22:17,500
How many minutes total did you watch of this video?

3983
03:22:17,500 --> 03:22:21,100
Did not count.

3984
03:22:21,100 --> 03:22:27,220
That's a tough thing to admit to as a corporate representative that like, ah, I recognized

3985
03:22:27,220 --> 03:22:33,720
a couple hours into this deposition that I was so underwater that I needed to go on break

3986
03:22:33,720 --> 03:22:36,540
and do the preparation that I should have done beforehand.

3987
03:22:36,540 --> 03:22:37,540
Right.

3988
03:22:37,540 --> 03:22:38,540
Right, right.

3989
03:22:38,540 --> 03:22:43,020
So we, so when I came into this, I was judging myself by Rob Dew standards.

3990
03:22:43,020 --> 03:22:44,340
And you're doing great.

3991
03:22:44,340 --> 03:22:49,580
And I really thought that I could do no wrong because I brought in Wikipedia articles and

3992
03:22:49,580 --> 03:22:50,580
that was-

3993
03:22:50,580 --> 03:22:51,580
DW no wrong.

3994
03:22:51,580 --> 03:22:52,580
Yes, exactly.

3995
03:22:52,580 --> 03:22:53,580
Sorry.

3996
03:22:53,580 --> 03:22:58,700
But, but now after talking to you, I'm realizing that I really should have crammed for my homework.

3997
03:22:58,700 --> 03:22:59,700
Yeah.

3998
03:22:59,700 --> 03:23:00,700
Yeah.

3999
03:23:00,700 --> 03:23:01,700
I should have done something.

4000
03:23:01,700 --> 03:23:02,700
Oh man, it would have been really nice.

4001
03:23:02,700 --> 03:23:03,700
I'm still better than Dew.

4002
03:23:03,700 --> 03:23:04,700
Yeah.

4003
03:23:04,700 --> 03:23:06,700
I watched a video during the break.

4004
03:23:06,700 --> 03:23:08,180
See, Dew didn't do that.

4005
03:23:08,180 --> 03:23:10,580
That I think won't play well.

4006
03:23:10,580 --> 03:23:14,340
No, no, that's, that's gotta, Jesus Christ.

4007
03:23:14,340 --> 03:23:15,540
Pretty bad.

4008
03:23:15,540 --> 03:23:16,540
So this next-

4009
03:23:16,540 --> 03:23:18,900
You know a judge read that, right?

4010
03:23:18,900 --> 03:23:24,020
Like, like she knows that somewhere along the line, a judge is going to go, you tried

4011
03:23:24,020 --> 03:23:26,580
to watch it when?

4012
03:23:26,580 --> 03:23:33,020
So this next clip has to do with an email exchange between Rob Dew and Dan Badandi.

4013
03:23:33,020 --> 03:23:39,140
So Dan Badandi had wanted to get clearance for some man on the street questions that

4014
03:23:39,140 --> 03:23:40,140
he wanted to do.

4015
03:23:40,140 --> 03:23:41,140
Do a man on the street piece.

4016
03:23:41,140 --> 03:23:42,140
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

4017
03:23:42,140 --> 03:23:47,180
And Rob Dew responded, no, go to Newtown.

4018
03:23:47,180 --> 03:23:48,180
Cover Sandy Hook.

4019
03:23:48,180 --> 03:23:49,180
Get the fuck out.

4020
03:23:49,180 --> 03:23:50,180
Right.

4021
03:23:50,180 --> 03:23:51,180
Come on.

4022
03:23:51,180 --> 03:23:52,180
So here's, here's how this goes.

4023
03:23:52,180 --> 03:23:53,180
Okay.

4024
03:23:53,180 --> 03:23:56,380
So, and then what we see basically here is just some proposed questions that he wants

4025
03:23:56,380 --> 03:23:58,700
to ask random people on the street, right?

4026
03:23:58,700 --> 03:23:59,700
Yes.

4027
03:23:59,700 --> 03:24:00,700
All right.

4028
03:24:00,700 --> 03:24:04,980
So this is a follow-up email from Rob Dew, he doesn't want Dan to do that, right?

4029
03:24:04,980 --> 03:24:05,980
Correct.

4030
03:24:05,980 --> 03:24:06,980
Right.

4031
03:24:06,980 --> 03:24:09,140
It's going to be old by the time they can air it, correct?

4032
03:24:09,140 --> 03:24:10,140
Yes.

4033
03:24:10,140 --> 03:24:11,140
Okay.

4034
03:24:11,140 --> 03:24:12,500
So he says, go to Sandy Hook, we will cover that, correct?

4035
03:24:12,500 --> 03:24:13,500
Yes.

4036
03:24:13,500 --> 03:24:14,500
Okay.

4037
03:24:14,500 --> 03:24:17,620
So it was an intentional choice by Mr. Dew to want to get Dan Badandi to go to Sandy

4038
03:24:17,620 --> 03:24:18,620
Hook, correct?

4039
03:24:18,620 --> 03:24:30,620
Yes, because it was in the news and the nature of, of the beast, so to speak, in the news,

4040
03:24:30,620 --> 03:24:33,420
the 24-hour news cycle expires really fast.

4041
03:24:33,420 --> 03:24:35,540
How was, excuse me, I'm sorry.

4042
03:24:35,540 --> 03:24:36,540
Yeah.

4043
03:24:36,540 --> 03:24:38,420
How was Sandy Hook in the news on 7-7-2015?

4044
03:24:38,420 --> 03:24:39,420
There we go.

4045
03:24:39,420 --> 03:24:40,420
What had happened that would put it in?

4046
03:24:40,420 --> 03:24:41,420
I was about to say.

4047
03:24:41,420 --> 03:24:46,940
Um, don't, I don't have the record of that right now.

4048
03:24:46,940 --> 03:24:47,940
Right.

4049
03:24:47,940 --> 03:24:50,060
So you don't know that it had anything to do.

4050
03:24:50,060 --> 03:24:56,260
Sandy Hook has been in the news, despite the fact that Alex have not mentioned it in years,

4051
03:24:56,260 --> 03:25:01,620
and it keeps being put in the news as if Alex is the one who is the purveyor of the Sandy

4052
03:25:01,620 --> 03:25:05,860
Hook news, the Sandy Hook, and him talking about the parents, yet it's the mainstream

4053
03:25:05,860 --> 03:25:13,900
media who keeps mentioning the parents and tormenting the parents and the entire situation.

4054
03:25:13,900 --> 03:25:20,500
When you say purveyor, when he's saying, go to Sandy Hook, we will cover that, Infowars

4055
03:25:20,500 --> 03:25:26,620
is being the purveyor through almost, almost three years after Sandy Hook is being the

4056
03:25:26,620 --> 03:25:29,020
purveyor of Sandy Hook coverage.

4057
03:25:29,020 --> 03:25:30,020
Correct?

4058
03:25:30,020 --> 03:25:31,020
No.

4059
03:25:31,020 --> 03:25:32,020
What is that then?

4060
03:25:32,020 --> 03:25:33,020
Again.

4061
03:25:33,020 --> 03:25:35,380
Is he saying that we're going to cover it and not air it?

4062
03:25:35,380 --> 03:25:38,300
He intends to put whatever Dan Badani does on the air.

4063
03:25:38,300 --> 03:25:39,300
Correct?

4064
03:25:39,300 --> 03:25:42,620
Uh, it depends if the report is good or not.

4065
03:25:42,620 --> 03:25:47,540
And then again, and answering this question, you've speculated out of thin air that there

4066
03:25:47,540 --> 03:25:53,180
was something going on around January 7th, 2015 that put this in the news, that made

4067
03:25:53,180 --> 03:25:54,180
it timely.

4068
03:25:54,180 --> 03:25:55,980
But that was pure speculation.

4069
03:25:55,980 --> 03:25:57,660
You have no idea what that might be.

4070
03:25:57,660 --> 03:25:58,660
Correct?

4071
03:25:58,660 --> 03:25:59,660
That's the nature of our news.

4072
03:25:59,660 --> 03:26:00,660
That's how we do news.

4073
03:26:00,660 --> 03:26:02,260
If there's something in the news, then we'll cover it.

4074
03:26:02,260 --> 03:26:03,780
Yeah, y'all were going to make news.

4075
03:26:03,780 --> 03:26:04,860
Do you understand that?

4076
03:26:04,860 --> 03:26:07,300
You're sending Dan Badani there to Wolfgang Halbeck.

4077
03:26:07,300 --> 03:26:08,740
Do you know what they did there?

4078
03:26:08,740 --> 03:26:09,740
No.

4079
03:26:09,740 --> 03:26:11,420
That's not good that she doesn't know.

4080
03:26:11,420 --> 03:26:15,640
I mean, if I were the corporate representative, I would definitely know that.

4081
03:26:15,640 --> 03:26:19,500
And I would have written some long explanation for why it's somehow okay.

4082
03:26:19,500 --> 03:26:24,460
Yeah, maybe some kind of rationalization at the very least, because it's, yeah, it's bad.

4083
03:26:24,460 --> 03:26:28,940
It would need to, look, St. Thomas Aquinas would have been proud of whatever I had written

4084
03:26:28,940 --> 03:26:31,060
to try and get out of that bullshit.

4085
03:26:31,060 --> 03:26:32,060
Because it takes a lot.

4086
03:26:32,060 --> 03:26:36,780
St. Thomas Aquinas is fun because actually Wolfgang Halbeck was harassing people at a

4087
03:26:36,780 --> 03:26:39,380
Catholic school.

4088
03:26:39,380 --> 03:26:40,380
Take that.

4089
03:26:40,380 --> 03:26:41,380
So it's actually appropriate.

4090
03:26:41,380 --> 03:26:44,300
No, they were probably Cistercian monks.

4091
03:26:44,300 --> 03:26:50,340
So there's another email from Dan Badandi that leads to a little bit of drama in the

4092
03:26:50,340 --> 03:26:51,340
room.

4093
03:26:51,340 --> 03:26:52,340
All right.

4094
03:26:52,340 --> 03:27:00,220
What we have here is from truthradio9990 at hotmail.com, and this was something sent to

4095
03:27:00,220 --> 03:27:02,660
robdoo at Infowars, right?

4096
03:27:02,660 --> 03:27:03,660
Right.

4097
03:27:03,660 --> 03:27:04,660
Okay.

4098
03:27:04,660 --> 03:27:10,160
And so we have this email here from Dan Badandi stating, someone you may want to get in that

4099
03:27:10,160 --> 03:27:16,620
documentary on Sandy Hook, and it says forward, Dan, Alex announced that he is going to do

4100
03:27:16,620 --> 03:27:19,260
a Sandy Hook doc film.

4101
03:27:19,260 --> 03:27:23,440
Sheila Matthews, who you met in Hartford at a Halbeck hearing is a friend of mine who

4102
03:27:23,440 --> 03:27:24,900
lives in the next town.

4103
03:27:24,900 --> 03:27:28,500
And I'm going to guess that says over and we don't know what it says after that, but

4104
03:27:28,500 --> 03:27:31,460
then it says, Sheila asked me to provide you with her telephone number.

4105
03:27:31,460 --> 03:27:33,660
It gets a telephone number, right?

4106
03:27:33,660 --> 03:27:34,660
Right.

4107
03:27:34,660 --> 03:27:35,660
Okay.

4108
03:27:35,660 --> 03:27:36,660
And then Rob sends it to you.

4109
03:27:36,660 --> 03:27:38,660
And this is April 24th, 2018.

4110
03:27:38,660 --> 03:27:39,660
Correct?

4111
03:27:39,660 --> 03:27:45,140
And he says, if Alex wants to go the Sandy Hook route, you may want to get this lady

4112
03:27:45,140 --> 03:27:46,140
on.

4113
03:27:46,140 --> 03:27:47,140
Oof.

4114
03:27:47,140 --> 03:27:48,140
Correct?

4115
03:27:48,140 --> 03:27:49,140
Yes.

4116
03:27:49,140 --> 03:27:50,140
Okay.

4117
03:27:50,140 --> 03:27:53,940
So this is just shortly after the company was sued, right?

4118
03:27:53,940 --> 03:27:55,740
Yes.

4119
03:27:55,740 --> 03:28:02,060
That's why he wants to make this documentary, right?

4120
03:28:02,060 --> 03:28:05,160
Not sure the exact reasons for Alex wanting to do a documentary.

4121
03:28:05,160 --> 03:28:06,580
What is the Sandy Hook route?

4122
03:28:06,580 --> 03:28:07,580
What is that?

4123
03:28:07,580 --> 03:28:09,980
You don't want to answer that question.

4124
03:28:09,980 --> 03:28:10,980
Never heard of it.

4125
03:28:10,980 --> 03:28:11,980
What?

4126
03:28:11,980 --> 03:28:17,860
So we have Dan Badandi suggesting a guest and writing an email where there's an awareness

4127
03:28:17,860 --> 03:28:24,540
that Alex is wanting to or planning to make a documentary about Sandy Hook in 2018.

4128
03:28:24,540 --> 03:28:25,540
Okay.

4129
03:28:25,540 --> 03:28:26,540
So the Sandy Hook route.

4130
03:28:26,540 --> 03:28:27,540
All right.

4131
03:28:27,540 --> 03:28:29,940
Now there's not a lot of beaches in Austin, but there are some.

4132
03:28:29,940 --> 03:28:32,740
And when you go to the beach, all right, there's sand everywhere.

4133
03:28:32,740 --> 03:28:34,260
And I don't know if you've heard about sand.

4134
03:28:34,260 --> 03:28:36,820
Sand is actually a bunch of crashed, you know, like it could be rock.

4135
03:28:36,820 --> 03:28:37,820
Sure.

4136
03:28:37,820 --> 03:28:38,820
It could be glass.

4137
03:28:38,820 --> 03:28:39,820
It could be any number of things.

4138
03:28:39,820 --> 03:28:40,820
So there's sand, right?

4139
03:28:40,820 --> 03:28:42,160
And we were going to go fishing.

4140
03:28:42,160 --> 03:28:43,160
We were going fishing.

4141
03:28:43,160 --> 03:28:44,580
There was a sand.

4142
03:28:44,580 --> 03:28:45,580
We were going fishing.

4143
03:28:45,580 --> 03:28:46,580
There's a hook.

4144
03:28:46,580 --> 03:28:47,580
See?

4145
03:28:47,580 --> 03:28:48,580
Sandy Hook route.

4146
03:28:48,580 --> 03:28:49,580
Completely different.

4147
03:28:49,580 --> 03:28:50,580
Completely different.

4148
03:28:50,580 --> 03:28:56,940
Alex was working on a sort of a scene, you know, like sort of a Tableau art decorative

4149
03:28:56,940 --> 03:28:57,940
piece where it was-

4150
03:28:57,940 --> 03:28:58,940
Oh, that sounds interesting.

4151
03:28:58,940 --> 03:28:59,940
Right.

4152
03:28:59,940 --> 03:29:01,420
And it was Peter Pan versus Captain Hook.

4153
03:29:01,420 --> 03:29:02,420
Oh.

4154
03:29:02,420 --> 03:29:04,620
But all of the characters were Pecan Sandies.

4155
03:29:04,620 --> 03:29:05,620
Oh.

4156
03:29:05,620 --> 03:29:06,620
They're all cookies.

4157
03:29:06,620 --> 03:29:07,620
Yeah.

4158
03:29:07,620 --> 03:29:08,620
Yeah.

4159
03:29:08,620 --> 03:29:09,620
Yeah.

4160
03:29:09,620 --> 03:29:10,620
That sounds like a delicious treat.

4161
03:29:10,620 --> 03:29:11,620
That is the route.

4162
03:29:11,620 --> 03:29:12,620
Yep.

4163
03:29:12,620 --> 03:29:16,620
So no, her sort of response to this, generally speaking, is that like, oh no, it had nothing

4164
03:29:16,620 --> 03:29:17,980
to do with the documentary.

4165
03:29:17,980 --> 03:29:22,720
It was just Rob was suggesting this person maybe Alex would want to have on the show

4166
03:29:22,720 --> 03:29:23,720
as a guest.

4167
03:29:23,720 --> 03:29:24,720
Right.

4168
03:29:24,720 --> 03:29:26,820
I don't really understand how that helps that much.

4169
03:29:26,820 --> 03:29:27,820
No.

4170
03:29:27,820 --> 03:29:33,620
But she's just trying to evade answering or recognizing that there was at least some kind

4171
03:29:33,620 --> 03:29:38,740
of an internally discussed plan that Alex wanted to make a documentary about Sandy Hook

4172
03:29:38,740 --> 03:29:42,180
in 2018 and that Dan Badandi was sending sources.

4173
03:29:42,180 --> 03:29:43,740
Yeah, that's not good.

4174
03:29:43,740 --> 03:29:49,540
The question about Dan Badandi sending sources, this is where things go off the rails.

4175
03:29:49,540 --> 03:29:57,220
If Rob Dew was sending to you a source from Dan Badandi, the truth warrior, we can be

4176
03:29:57,220 --> 03:30:03,300
fairly certain that that guest was going to support the idea that Sandy Hook was fake.

4177
03:30:03,300 --> 03:30:04,300
Right.

4178
03:30:04,300 --> 03:30:05,940
That's a fair assumption.

4179
03:30:05,940 --> 03:30:06,940
Objection form.

4180
03:30:06,940 --> 03:30:09,580
Don't answer that question.

4181
03:30:09,580 --> 03:30:10,580
Why not?

4182
03:30:10,580 --> 03:30:12,860
Because that's extremely misleading.

4183
03:30:12,860 --> 03:30:14,820
That's not a proper basis to object to.

4184
03:30:14,820 --> 03:30:17,740
Go read the rule.

4185
03:30:17,740 --> 03:30:20,280
Madam court reporter, can you read my question back?

4186
03:30:20,280 --> 03:30:25,860
So it's pretty clear that the reason that this was a question that if you can pull off,

4187
03:30:25,860 --> 03:30:27,620
you don't want your client to answer.

4188
03:30:27,620 --> 03:30:28,620
No, absolutely.

4189
03:30:28,620 --> 03:30:29,620
You do not want that.

4190
03:30:29,620 --> 03:30:30,620
No, no, no, no, of course not.

4191
03:30:30,620 --> 03:30:34,380
It wasn't for Dan Badandi just to be suggesting a guest, but for him to send in a guest on

4192
03:30:34,380 --> 03:30:38,540
the subject of Sandy Hook, referencing a documentary Alex is thinking of making.

4193
03:30:38,540 --> 03:30:42,180
And then for Rob to forward that onto Daria, that indicates that there was internal action

4194
03:30:42,180 --> 03:30:44,900
being taken on Badandi's suggestion.

4195
03:30:44,900 --> 03:30:48,500
It wasn't just something that they ignored, like they want to pretend they always do with

4196
03:30:48,500 --> 03:30:49,500
Dan Badandi.

4197
03:30:49,500 --> 03:30:51,180
You get 10,000 emails a day.

4198
03:30:51,180 --> 03:30:52,180
Sure.

4199
03:30:52,180 --> 03:30:55,300
The implication is clearly that there was an interest in interviewing guests who would

4200
03:30:55,300 --> 03:31:01,460
support that the Sandy Hook was a hoax narrative after Alex got sued in the case.

4201
03:31:01,460 --> 03:31:05,220
And that's why Brad, the lawyer is saying, don't answer that question.

4202
03:31:05,220 --> 03:31:06,220
Yeah, yeah.

4203
03:31:06,220 --> 03:31:07,220
Don't answer that question.

4204
03:31:07,220 --> 03:31:12,220
If Rob Dew was sending to you a source for Dan Badandi, the truth lawyer, would you be

4205
03:31:12,220 --> 03:31:17,220
fairly certain that that guest was going to support the idea that Sandy Hook was fake,

4206
03:31:17,220 --> 03:31:18,220
right?

4207
03:31:18,220 --> 03:31:19,220
That's a fair assumption.

4208
03:31:19,220 --> 03:31:22,660
Have her answer the question or I'll move for sanctions.

4209
03:31:22,660 --> 03:31:23,660
I will.

4210
03:31:23,660 --> 03:31:24,660
I will move to compel that answer.

4211
03:31:24,660 --> 03:31:28,540
If you haven't or not answered that question, it's a very clear what you're trying to hide.

4212
03:31:28,540 --> 03:31:32,460
I want her to answer the question.

4213
03:31:32,460 --> 03:31:34,660
I don't appreciate the threats when I'm.

4214
03:31:34,660 --> 03:31:35,660
It's not a threat, Brad.

4215
03:31:35,660 --> 03:31:38,380
It is a threat and I don't really appreciate it.

4216
03:31:38,380 --> 03:31:39,380
You know what?

4217
03:31:39,380 --> 03:31:40,380
Look at where we are in this case.

4218
03:31:40,380 --> 03:31:41,380
Go ahead.

4219
03:31:41,380 --> 03:31:42,380
Go ahead.

4220
03:31:42,380 --> 03:31:44,500
If you know the answer to the question, proceed with answering the question.

4221
03:31:44,500 --> 03:31:48,540
I get sent a lot of guests on a daily basis.

4222
03:31:48,540 --> 03:32:02,100
There's no way for me to know this specific guest would be pro Sandy Hook conspiracy theory

4223
03:32:02,100 --> 03:32:06,940
or the official version.

4224
03:32:06,940 --> 03:32:07,940
No idea.

4225
03:32:07,940 --> 03:32:08,940
No.

4226
03:32:08,940 --> 03:32:10,180
I don't think that's a reliable answer.

4227
03:32:10,180 --> 03:32:11,180
You couldn't predict.

4228
03:32:11,180 --> 03:32:13,740
But I think that's, you know, fine.

4229
03:32:13,740 --> 03:32:16,100
It'll just look, you know, that just looks like obfuscation.

4230
03:32:16,100 --> 03:32:17,100
Yeah.

4231
03:32:17,100 --> 03:32:18,100
Yeah, yeah.

4232
03:32:18,100 --> 03:32:20,660
I'm confused as to what, uh, what Brad's up to here.

4233
03:32:20,660 --> 03:32:26,140
I mean, maybe Brad's just like, uh, I got to make it look like I'm working because if

4234
03:32:26,140 --> 03:32:28,780
I was Brad, I'm just looking at hours, man.

4235
03:32:28,780 --> 03:32:31,660
I think he gets the implication of answering that question.

4236
03:32:31,660 --> 03:32:32,660
Oh, totally.

4237
03:32:32,660 --> 03:32:37,420
And if you can, if you can pull off an objection there, you might want to.

4238
03:32:37,420 --> 03:32:38,420
Totally.

4239
03:32:38,420 --> 03:32:39,420
Crucially.

4240
03:32:39,420 --> 03:32:42,620
However, again, you're going to be fired in like a month or two.

4241
03:32:42,620 --> 03:32:44,220
If past is prelude.

4242
03:32:44,220 --> 03:32:48,300
Alex's lawyers are not long on the job.

4243
03:32:48,300 --> 03:32:49,300
No.

4244
03:32:49,300 --> 03:32:50,300
So just, just show up.

4245
03:32:50,300 --> 03:32:52,180
Why would you get into a fight with Mark?

4246
03:32:52,180 --> 03:32:53,180
Come on, man.

4247
03:32:53,180 --> 03:32:56,960
We're both, we both know what's going on here.

4248
03:32:56,960 --> 03:33:04,620
So this, it leads to an assessment of how Badandi, like, what does he do?

4249
03:33:04,620 --> 03:33:05,620
What is he up to?

4250
03:33:05,620 --> 03:33:07,620
How is that guy?

4251
03:33:07,620 --> 03:33:10,660
You know what Dan Badandi believes about Sandy Hook, don't you?

4252
03:33:10,660 --> 03:33:11,660
You personally, Daria Karpova.

4253
03:33:11,660 --> 03:33:12,660
I do not.

4254
03:33:12,660 --> 03:33:13,660
You don't know?

4255
03:33:13,660 --> 03:33:14,660
I do not.

4256
03:33:14,660 --> 03:33:15,660
No.

4257
03:33:15,660 --> 03:33:18,500
As an Infowars producer here to testify as by half of the company, you also didn't do

4258
03:33:18,500 --> 03:33:20,940
anything to prepare to know what Dan Badandi did, right?

4259
03:33:20,940 --> 03:33:23,500
That's not part of the topics you were asked to talk about today.

4260
03:33:23,500 --> 03:33:29,100
I know Dan Badandi had questions and believe that there was a coverup in the Sandy Hook

4261
03:33:29,100 --> 03:33:30,100
case.

4262
03:33:30,100 --> 03:33:34,260
He did his hardest trying to investigate as a good reporter would.

4263
03:33:34,260 --> 03:33:37,380
You were testifying here right now, Dan Badandi is a good reporter.

4264
03:33:37,380 --> 03:33:41,340
Is that what you're testifying to?

4265
03:33:41,340 --> 03:33:45,860
Insofar as him trying to investigate what happened and find the truth, that's what a

4266
03:33:45,860 --> 03:33:47,220
good reporter is supposed to do.

4267
03:33:47,220 --> 03:33:50,540
You seen any videos of Dan Badandi in Connecticut of what he did?

4268
03:33:50,540 --> 03:33:51,540
You ever watched him?

4269
03:33:51,540 --> 03:33:52,540
Not recently.

4270
03:33:52,540 --> 03:33:56,060
You might not be the best person to qualify to talk about whether Dan Badandi was a good

4271
03:33:56,060 --> 03:33:57,260
reporter in Newtown, are you?

4272
03:33:57,260 --> 03:33:59,780
Objection form, that's not what she said.

4273
03:33:59,780 --> 03:34:02,420
That's what I'm asking her a question, Brad.

4274
03:34:02,420 --> 03:34:03,420
I'm asking you.

4275
03:34:03,420 --> 03:34:08,940
You may not be the best qualified person to talk about what Dan Badandi did in Newtown,

4276
03:34:08,940 --> 03:34:09,940
correct?

4277
03:34:09,940 --> 03:34:13,980
Who is Zaria Kapova, Infowars employee?

4278
03:34:13,980 --> 03:34:20,420
My definition of a good reporter is somebody who seeks the truth and is going to great

4279
03:34:20,420 --> 03:34:23,980
lengths in order to find it.

4280
03:34:23,980 --> 03:34:28,300
So you don't, but you can admit to me right now, you don't know what Dan Badandi did in

4281
03:34:28,300 --> 03:34:29,300
Newtown?

4282
03:34:29,300 --> 03:34:36,060
His specific actions, I don't know, but you just mentioned what-

4283
03:34:36,060 --> 03:34:39,220
Do you know about Saint Rose of Lima Catholic School in Newtown?

4284
03:34:39,220 --> 03:34:42,620
What Dan Badandi and Wolfgang Habig did there?

4285
03:34:42,620 --> 03:34:43,620
Not off the top of my head.

4286
03:34:43,620 --> 03:34:44,940
That's that Catholic school in question.

4287
03:34:44,940 --> 03:34:45,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4288
03:34:45,940 --> 03:34:51,580
So yeah, this, I mean, that's priceless almost, like the corporate representative being unaware

4289
03:34:51,580 --> 03:34:54,940
of what Dan Badandi did, but also saying that she's-

4290
03:34:54,940 --> 03:34:55,940
He's a great reporter.

4291
03:34:55,940 --> 03:34:56,940
He's a great reporter.

4292
03:34:56,940 --> 03:34:57,940
He's one of the best.

4293
03:34:57,940 --> 03:35:02,340
Because you can just play he's a great reporter and then show the footage of him yelling at

4294
03:35:02,340 --> 03:35:04,660
people in Newtown.

4295
03:35:04,660 --> 03:35:07,940
I mean, I assume they think that's what a great reporter does.

4296
03:35:07,940 --> 03:35:08,940
I think so.

4297
03:35:08,940 --> 03:35:09,940
Yeah.

4298
03:35:09,940 --> 03:35:10,940
The dogged persistence.

4299
03:35:10,940 --> 03:35:14,180
Yeah, they are very, very shallow people.

4300
03:35:14,180 --> 03:35:21,620
So one of the questions in this case is regarding whether or not the Sandy Hook kind of materials

4301
03:35:21,620 --> 03:35:27,020
were used strategically in terms of marketing or that kind of thing.

4302
03:35:27,020 --> 03:35:29,780
And Daria says absolutely not.

4303
03:35:29,780 --> 03:35:37,620
Has InfoWars, when making its editorial discussions and decisions about the Sandy Hook coverage,

4304
03:35:37,620 --> 03:35:45,820
has it ever attempted to use its Sandy Hook stories and videos in a strategic way to attract

4305
03:35:45,820 --> 03:35:46,820
viewers?

4306
03:35:46,820 --> 03:35:47,820
No.

4307
03:35:47,820 --> 03:35:48,820
Okay.

4308
03:35:48,820 --> 03:35:55,820
The idea that we would make some video uploads about Sandy Hook as a strategic measure, that's

4309
03:35:55,820 --> 03:36:03,060
not something that would be a part of InfoWars editorial discussions.

4310
03:36:03,060 --> 03:36:04,060
Never.

4311
03:36:04,060 --> 03:36:05,060
Never.

4312
03:36:05,060 --> 03:36:06,060
Okay.

4313
03:36:06,060 --> 03:36:07,060
Never.

4314
03:36:07,060 --> 03:36:08,060
All right.

4315
03:36:08,060 --> 03:36:09,060
So I'm a quarterback in the pocket, right?

4316
03:36:09,060 --> 03:36:10,060
Yeah.

4317
03:36:10,060 --> 03:36:11,060
I'm starting to feel pressure.

4318
03:36:11,060 --> 03:36:12,060
Okay?

4319
03:36:12,060 --> 03:36:13,060
You should.

4320
03:36:13,060 --> 03:36:16,020
All of a sudden, I'm starting to see the defensive end running straight towards my face because

4321
03:36:16,020 --> 03:36:20,420
this question is not a calm and happy question that is going to end with your answer being

4322
03:36:20,420 --> 03:36:21,720
accepted as okay.

4323
03:36:21,720 --> 03:36:22,720
It's a blitz.

4324
03:36:22,720 --> 03:36:26,780
You don't have a football and it turns out all the rules have been lifted.

4325
03:36:26,780 --> 03:36:27,780
Yeah.

4326
03:36:27,780 --> 03:36:29,380
And it's 20 against one.

4327
03:36:29,380 --> 03:36:30,380
Yeah.

4328
03:36:30,380 --> 03:36:31,380
There is no offensive line.

4329
03:36:31,380 --> 03:36:32,380
Nope.

4330
03:36:32,380 --> 03:36:33,380
It's just you getting your ass kicked.

4331
03:36:33,380 --> 03:36:39,700
I'm going to show you what I've marked as exhibit 15.

4332
03:36:39,700 --> 03:36:43,180
Can you tell me who at the top here, well actually let me start at the bottom, at the

4333
03:36:43,180 --> 03:36:48,340
bottom corner you see there's a mark that says FSS TX-076069, correct?

4334
03:36:48,340 --> 03:36:49,340
Yes.

4335
03:36:49,340 --> 03:36:50,340
Okay.

4336
03:36:50,340 --> 03:36:54,500
Now, can you tell me first, let's just look at the top of the email.

4337
03:36:54,500 --> 03:36:55,500
Who is Darren?

4338
03:36:55,500 --> 03:36:57,220
Darren McBreen.

4339
03:36:57,220 --> 03:37:00,540
His title in 2015, do you know?

4340
03:37:00,540 --> 03:37:01,540
Editor.

4341
03:37:01,540 --> 03:37:02,540
Okay.

4342
03:37:02,540 --> 03:37:04,300
Who is Rob Dew, we've talked about, correct?

4343
03:37:04,300 --> 03:37:05,300
Yes.

4344
03:37:05,300 --> 03:37:06,700
Louie S, we've talked about, right?

4345
03:37:06,700 --> 03:37:07,700
Yes.

4346
03:37:07,700 --> 03:37:08,700
Okay.

4347
03:37:08,700 --> 03:37:09,700
The next other person that's on here is Travis Knight.

4348
03:37:09,700 --> 03:37:10,700
Do you know who that person is?

4349
03:37:10,700 --> 03:37:11,700
Yes.

4350
03:37:11,700 --> 03:37:12,700
Okay.

4351
03:37:12,700 --> 03:37:13,700
And do you know what their job position is?

4352
03:37:13,700 --> 03:37:14,700
Editor.

4353
03:37:14,700 --> 03:37:15,700
Okay.

4354
03:37:15,700 --> 03:37:21,780
And then this email is being sent from Louie S to Travis Knight, Rob Dew, and Darren.

4355
03:37:21,780 --> 03:37:27,300
And the subject is video files for Facebook upload on September 24, 2015.

4356
03:37:27,300 --> 03:37:28,300
That's correct?

4357
03:37:28,300 --> 03:37:29,300
Yes.

4358
03:37:29,300 --> 03:37:30,300
Okay.

4359
03:37:30,300 --> 03:37:35,020
Now, can I get these video files for future strategic Facebook uploads, correct?

4360
03:37:35,020 --> 03:37:36,020
Yes.

4361
03:37:36,020 --> 03:37:43,020
One of the files that he was asking for is why people think Sandy Hooks is a hooks, correct?

4362
03:37:43,020 --> 03:37:46,740
He didn't think they used the fucking word.

4363
03:37:46,740 --> 03:37:47,740
Yes.

4364
03:37:47,740 --> 03:37:48,740
Okay.

4365
03:37:48,740 --> 03:37:53,260
So we can tell from this email, and then Darren follows up and says, any luck finding these,

4366
03:37:53,260 --> 03:37:54,260
correct?

4367
03:37:54,260 --> 03:37:55,260
Yes.

4368
03:37:55,260 --> 03:38:00,300
So we can tell from this email that editor Darren and Louie S were attempting to use a

4369
03:38:00,300 --> 03:38:06,500
video about Sandy Hook being a hoax as a future strategic Facebook upload, correct?

4370
03:38:06,500 --> 03:38:10,420
It's one of the videos out of eight videos that he's requesting.

4371
03:38:10,420 --> 03:38:11,420
Sure.

4372
03:38:11,420 --> 03:38:15,980
So it is one of the videos being used for a future strategic Facebook upload, correct?

4373
03:38:15,980 --> 03:38:17,460
Objection form.

4374
03:38:17,460 --> 03:38:18,460
Yes.

4375
03:38:18,460 --> 03:38:19,460
Okay.

4376
03:38:19,460 --> 03:38:23,620
But won't you consider that there are seven others?

4377
03:38:23,620 --> 03:38:28,980
Oh, it wasn't just a sack, it was a strip sack and the defense has run it all the way

4378
03:38:28,980 --> 03:38:29,980
for the score.

4379
03:38:29,980 --> 03:38:34,300
Well, I mean, I think obviously you asked the question with the word strategic in it

4380
03:38:34,300 --> 03:38:35,300
because you know that-

4381
03:38:35,300 --> 03:38:38,980
Because you know the word strategic is going to be used, yeah.

4382
03:38:38,980 --> 03:38:41,140
It's not so much a magic trick as it is preparing.

4383
03:38:41,140 --> 03:38:42,140
No.

4384
03:38:42,140 --> 03:38:46,900
Well, I just would never have expected them to really have used the word strategic.

4385
03:38:46,900 --> 03:38:50,940
I think that at a certain point there probably wasn't a concern about it.

4386
03:38:50,940 --> 03:38:51,940
Yeah.

4387
03:38:51,940 --> 03:38:52,940
No, they just didn't give a fuck.

4388
03:38:52,940 --> 03:38:53,940
Yeah.

4389
03:38:53,940 --> 03:38:54,940
Amazing.

4390
03:38:54,940 --> 03:38:59,540
So Mark wants to talk a little bit about this idea of Wolfgang Halbig because obviously

4391
03:38:59,540 --> 03:39:05,300
he's a source for a lot of the stuff and especially the way that Daria is presenting it, a lot

4392
03:39:05,300 --> 03:39:07,280
of it's probably just Halbig stuff.

4393
03:39:07,280 --> 03:39:11,500
So the bio that she brought, it's time to talk about it a little bit.

4394
03:39:11,500 --> 03:39:12,500
Word for word.

4395
03:39:12,500 --> 03:39:14,260
Let's go on to talk about Wolfgang Halbig.

4396
03:39:14,260 --> 03:39:21,300
Would you mind opening up your blue folder for me?

4397
03:39:21,300 --> 03:39:23,100
You see that article on top?

4398
03:39:23,100 --> 03:39:25,820
That's something you brought today and you were talking about how much, you were talking

4399
03:39:25,820 --> 03:39:29,760
about like you wanted to read it today, right?

4400
03:39:29,760 --> 03:39:31,540
To talk about Wolfgang's qualifications?

4401
03:39:31,540 --> 03:39:34,140
Yes, his bio specifically.

4402
03:39:34,140 --> 03:39:35,140
Right his bio, okay.

4403
03:39:35,140 --> 03:39:41,160
So this article that you brought is what you believe, let me ask you this.

4404
03:39:41,160 --> 03:39:44,740
Is that something that InfoWars had before you went and looked for it for your deposition

4405
03:39:44,740 --> 03:39:49,700
or is that something that you got for your deposition to help you acquaint yourself?

4406
03:39:49,700 --> 03:39:50,700
The latter.

4407
03:39:50,700 --> 03:39:51,700
Okay.

4408
03:39:51,700 --> 03:39:56,820
So before this deposition InfoWars did not have this document in its corporate files?

4409
03:39:56,820 --> 03:40:04,140
Correct, the files that I looked through that I searched for Halbig's bio I could not find

4410
03:40:04,140 --> 03:40:09,340
anything as well as seems like it's his been memory hold on the internet as well so that's

4411
03:40:09,340 --> 03:40:12,700
the only article that I could actually find in an archive.

4412
03:40:12,700 --> 03:40:13,700
What?

4413
03:40:13,700 --> 03:40:14,700
I'm sorry, what?

4414
03:40:14,700 --> 03:40:16,820
Who actually listed his bio.

4415
03:40:16,820 --> 03:40:18,940
Did you go try to search Wolfgang Halbig on Google?

4416
03:40:18,940 --> 03:40:19,940
Did you do that?

4417
03:40:19,940 --> 03:40:20,940
Yes.

4418
03:40:20,940 --> 03:40:24,500
Okay and so when you say he's been memory hold I take it you're ignoring the dozens

4419
03:40:24,500 --> 03:40:28,140
of mainstream articles about Wolfgang Halbig, you don't want to use the mainstream articles.

4420
03:40:28,140 --> 03:40:32,900
I'm talking specifically his bio, his credentials have been memory hold.

4421
03:40:32,900 --> 03:40:37,740
Okay, there are mainstream articles that talk about Wolfgang's credentials or his alleged

4422
03:40:37,740 --> 03:40:39,140
credentials right?

4423
03:40:39,140 --> 03:40:40,580
Did you see any of those?

4424
03:40:40,580 --> 03:40:48,260
I've looked at many of them and I did not see an actual biography of his accomplishments.

4425
03:40:48,260 --> 03:40:58,620
So you brought us instead this exhibit 1f written by Dr. Eowyn, do you know who that

4426
03:40:58,620 --> 03:40:59,620
is?

4427
03:40:59,620 --> 03:41:04,660
I do not, I didn't bring it for the author, I brought it for the bio that is including

4428
03:41:04,660 --> 03:41:05,740
this article.

4429
03:41:05,740 --> 03:41:13,820
So now if you're Daria sitting there you have brought this and if the name Dr. Eowyn for

4430
03:41:13,820 --> 03:41:19,180
example it's a pretty detailed, like a small detail of this that's being brought up you

4431
03:41:19,180 --> 03:41:22,260
probably should you know maybe recognize it's for a reason.

4432
03:41:22,260 --> 03:41:27,140
Oh no I would be like hold on can I have that document real quick and then shred it eat

4433
03:41:27,140 --> 03:41:30,620
it yeah yeah absolutely no you can't prove shit man.

4434
03:41:30,620 --> 03:41:33,660
Yeah because there's bad news about this.

4435
03:41:33,660 --> 03:41:37,820
Do you have any faith sitting here today that the information contained in that article

4436
03:41:37,820 --> 03:41:40,420
is accurate?

4437
03:41:40,420 --> 03:41:46,860
That's because even the people who disagree with Wolfgen Habig admit that he has a lengthy

4438
03:41:46,860 --> 03:41:47,860
bio that's impressive.

4439
03:41:47,860 --> 03:41:49,180
Who said that?

4440
03:41:49,180 --> 03:41:53,380
I've read it in different articles when I was searching for his bio.

4441
03:41:53,380 --> 03:41:55,260
I thought you said his bio is the memory holder.

4442
03:41:55,260 --> 03:41:59,940
Well exactly they failed to mention his bio but they do acknowledge that he's got an extensive

4443
03:41:59,940 --> 03:42:05,540
bio if that bio is covered accurately but I could not find the actual bio because the

4444
03:42:05,540 --> 03:42:06,540
bio was not included.

4445
03:42:06,540 --> 03:42:07,740
It's accurate meaning to you.

4446
03:42:07,740 --> 03:42:10,460
You think it's covered accurately there?

4447
03:42:10,460 --> 03:42:11,460
That's what you think?

4448
03:42:11,460 --> 03:42:12,460
Yes.

4449
03:42:12,460 --> 03:42:16,020
Okay and the person who wrote that Dr. Eowyn do you know who that is?

4450
03:42:16,020 --> 03:42:17,020
No.

4451
03:42:17,020 --> 03:42:18,020
He doesn't have a last name right?

4452
03:42:18,020 --> 03:42:20,120
I do not believe that's the person who wrote this article.

4453
03:42:20,120 --> 03:42:21,540
Go back and look at the first page.

4454
03:42:21,540 --> 03:42:31,500
No no no I understand that the article was posted by the said Dr. Eowyn.

4455
03:42:31,500 --> 03:42:39,140
The bio that's been screenshotted here it's not even typed it's screenshotted from somewhere

4456
03:42:39,140 --> 03:42:40,140
else.

4457
03:42:40,140 --> 03:42:41,140
From where?

4458
03:42:41,140 --> 03:42:43,420
Oh boy.

4459
03:42:43,420 --> 03:42:47,900
I do not have the source the exact source where it was printed from.

4460
03:42:47,900 --> 03:42:48,900
You have no idea where that came from.

4461
03:42:48,900 --> 03:42:55,340
But like I said people who disagree with Habig and who criticize him admit that his bio is

4462
03:42:55,340 --> 03:42:56,340
impressive.

4463
03:42:56,340 --> 03:42:58,020
I'm still waiting to see that.

4464
03:42:58,020 --> 03:43:00,620
Do you have any information you can point me to that?

4465
03:43:00,620 --> 03:43:04,340
What do you say who's an opponent of Habig who admits that he has an impressive bio?

4466
03:43:04,340 --> 03:43:09,100
Yeah I would have printed those documents if that's what I thought I needed for you

4467
03:43:09,100 --> 03:43:16,460
but to my satisfaction I did the research and to my satisfaction this bio checks out.

4468
03:43:16,460 --> 03:43:20,960
Let's talk about what satisfied you which is apparently a screenshot that you cannot

4469
03:43:20,960 --> 03:43:26,700
identify where it came from printed in an article by Dr. Eowyn who did you who first

4470
03:43:26,700 --> 03:43:30,380
of all that's let me pull this question back.

4471
03:43:30,380 --> 03:43:31,380
Do you know who Dr. Eowyn is?

4472
03:43:31,380 --> 03:43:34,780
Did you know Dr. Eowyn wrote chapter two of Jim Fetzer's book Nobody Died at Sandy Hook?

4473
03:43:34,780 --> 03:43:36,780
There we go.

4474
03:43:36,780 --> 03:43:39,100
Uh oh.

4475
03:43:39,100 --> 03:43:46,540
Did you know that the doctor that you you brought into here is only good for my case?

4476
03:43:46,540 --> 03:43:49,300
Wrote a chapter of Jim Fetzer's book No One Died at Sandy Hook.

4477
03:43:49,300 --> 03:43:52,500
Do you want to be more closely associated with Jim Fetzer?

4478
03:43:52,500 --> 03:43:53,500
Uh huh.

4479
03:43:53,500 --> 03:43:55,500
Let's get it.

4480
03:43:55,500 --> 03:43:59,180
You've created more trouble for yourself by bringing this bio.

4481
03:43:59,180 --> 03:44:00,180
Bananas.

4482
03:44:00,180 --> 03:44:03,980
This is a bananas double decker of depositions.

4483
03:44:03,980 --> 03:44:04,980
Yeah.

4484
03:44:04,980 --> 03:44:05,980
Yeah.

4485
03:44:05,980 --> 03:44:10,660
So I'm going to skip a couple of clips here because they're long and they essentially

4486
03:44:10,660 --> 03:44:15,060
achieve a very similar thing that you see in all of these and that is like this idea

4487
03:44:15,060 --> 03:44:20,580
of like if you'd known that how big was a bad source right would you have acted on it

4488
03:44:20,580 --> 03:44:26,860
earlier right you know and then of course Mark produces an email from March 2014 of

4489
03:44:26,860 --> 03:44:30,580
somebody being like this guy's credentials do not check out this is no good and then

4490
03:44:30,580 --> 03:44:35,660
a Don Salazar responding to the guy oh boy and so like there's there's interaction with

4491
03:44:35,660 --> 03:44:40,220
this person who's clearly bringing up long before they stopped having him on the show

4492
03:44:40,220 --> 03:44:44,660
right that he appears to be full of shit right and then they did nothing they took no action

4493
03:44:44,660 --> 03:44:50,420
on it right didn't double check his credentials or like whether he was a reliable source I

4494
03:44:50,420 --> 03:44:55,580
mean it looks bad but it's something that we see kind of a bunch happen in these depositions

4495
03:44:55,580 --> 03:45:03,580
it feels like and this is what is getting into my head it feels like neither Alex nor

4496
03:45:03,580 --> 03:45:09,820
and let's face it all of info wars does not understand that when they are in a deposition

4497
03:45:09,820 --> 03:45:17,660
the plaintiff is not asking them questions for fun for fun yeah like I said with Alex

4498
03:45:17,660 --> 03:45:23,260
it's like he's not asking about your audience size for a puff piece no this is not because

4499
03:45:23,260 --> 03:45:28,800
they know the answers that's the point of the deposition is for you to say some dumb

4500
03:45:28,800 --> 03:45:35,660
bullshit it's and you're doing that yes and oh my god oh my god so the hold on to that

4501
03:45:35,660 --> 03:45:41,100
idea oh my god because the emails from Wolfgang that were harassing the Sandy Hook families

4502
03:45:41,100 --> 03:45:47,660
that we he read that we read Alex deposition come back up uh-huh and we heard how Alex

4503
03:45:47,660 --> 03:45:56,260
responded to them yeah now let's see how Daria does so this first one is about the dirty

4504
03:45:56,260 --> 03:46:00,700
school email right so how could you let your daughter go to that school yeah and here's

4505
03:46:00,700 --> 03:46:06,180
Daria's take on it okay so first of all um how do you how does the company feel about

4506
03:46:06,180 --> 03:46:13,180
this email objection form what's your objection well vague how does the company feel sure

4507
03:46:13,180 --> 03:46:21,820
feelings no problem that's good good work Brad how's it coming feel about to see my

4508
03:46:21,820 --> 03:46:29,260
mr. Halvik is asking it seems to be concerned for their well-being of this child thank you

4509
03:46:29,260 --> 03:46:33,500
miss carpa let me actually I want to read this email into the record so we can talk

4510
03:46:33,500 --> 03:46:39,500
about it okay mr. Halvik writes Michelle how could you and your husband as responsible

4511
03:46:39,500 --> 03:46:44,500
parents even allow your precious child Josephine to attend that filthy and deplorable looking

4512
03:46:44,500 --> 03:46:49,600
school on December 14th 2012 so Mark's reading it afterwards because she was responding to

4513
03:46:49,600 --> 03:46:54,820
having read it to herself she was like silently reading it yeah and that was wild and listening

4514
03:46:54,820 --> 03:46:58,180
to this all the way through especially if you've heard Alex's deposition you start to

4515
03:46:58,180 --> 03:47:02,420
notice some really weird dynamics that only become clear if they're being asked about

4516
03:47:02,420 --> 03:47:08,620
the same documents you know it's it's really weird this document where Halvik is harassing

4517
03:47:08,620 --> 03:47:12,420
this parent about how filthy the school was is read by Daria and then she immediately

4518
03:47:12,420 --> 03:47:16,220
responds that it sounds like a person who's concerned about the well-being of the child

4519
03:47:16,220 --> 03:47:22,420
it's it's just so great to know that someone cares meanwhile Alex reads it and isn't disgusted

4520
03:47:22,420 --> 03:47:25,800
yeah there's a couple things that I could think of that might explain these different

4521
03:47:25,800 --> 03:47:30,280
responses the first is that they may have prepared for the depositions differently so

4522
03:47:30,280 --> 03:47:34,960
Alex might have been slightly more prepared the second is a possibility that Alex has

4523
03:47:34,960 --> 03:47:39,580
at least a modicum of emotional intelligence and can tell that he's supposed to not make

4524
03:47:39,580 --> 03:47:44,120
excuses for an email like that whereas Daria is just in like cover your ass and deflect

4525
03:47:44,120 --> 03:47:49,700
mode as I was thinking about this or as I call it researching in my mind I think I came

4526
03:47:49,700 --> 03:47:55,380
up with another possibility this feels like maybe it's connected to Daria's bizarre comments

4527
03:47:55,380 --> 03:47:59,380
about it being a function of optimism to promote the idea that the children from Sandy Hook

4528
03:47:59,380 --> 03:48:04,420
were still alive I jumped right to that immediately this is a fantasy reality where no one with

4529
03:48:04,420 --> 03:48:08,660
a heart would want to believe that Wolfgang Halbig was an almost cartoon level asshole

4530
03:48:08,660 --> 03:48:12,780
who spent his free time harassing grieving parents anyone with a heart would want to

4531
03:48:12,780 --> 03:48:17,560
believe that he's just very concerned about the janitorial staff at the school yeah yet

4532
03:48:17,560 --> 03:48:22,320
another option I considered is that it's really difficult as an emotional thing to confront

4533
03:48:22,320 --> 03:48:27,700
you know to see the actions in the real world of a person who you were an active participant

4534
03:48:27,700 --> 03:48:31,900
in promoting yeah when you see that he was harassing and stalking these parents and you

4535
03:48:31,900 --> 03:48:36,580
know that your network and all your co-workers were whitewashing his reputation raising money

4536
03:48:36,580 --> 03:48:41,460
for him and effectively enabling his behavior that's got to be a bit of a gut punch and

4537
03:48:41,460 --> 03:48:46,620
I I can kind of see why you might want to pretend it's not real here's my take on it

4538
03:48:46,620 --> 03:48:54,700
because I I see where you're coming from and I'm going to be far less generous as is my

4539
03:48:54,700 --> 03:49:05,160
want yes that is our roles um I I see it more like in order to be the host right in order

4540
03:49:05,160 --> 03:49:11,380
to be on screen in order to attract an audience people have to be able to make a an emotional

4541
03:49:11,380 --> 03:49:17,800
connection right they have to sure so whether or not you're a true psychopath or whatever

4542
03:49:17,800 --> 03:49:23,720
it is you want to say at the very least you have to have the emotional ability to evoke

4543
03:49:23,720 --> 03:49:27,660
emotion well I mean that you see that with Alex all the time the fake crying and totally

4544
03:49:27,660 --> 03:49:37,580
yeah and I would say that for to work with Alex it would require a an abdication of general

4545
03:49:37,580 --> 03:49:42,380
human sympathy and empathy entirely and that would kind of make sense why Daria has never

4546
03:49:42,380 --> 03:49:47,580
been an on-air person exactly I mean the when I think about it the more I think about people

4547
03:49:47,580 --> 03:49:52,860
like you know listening to Daria's deposition I think about fucking Tucker Carlson you know

4548
03:49:52,860 --> 03:49:58,300
like Tucker Carlson can go on his show and if he didn't have editorial people stopping

4549
03:49:58,300 --> 03:50:05,540
him he could easily easily do all the same Alex shit he's just got a bigger network with

4550
03:50:05,540 --> 03:50:12,980
people reining him in lawyers yeah and those people are fucking psychos it has to be like

4551
03:50:12,980 --> 03:50:19,180
it's the only way that you can work with a fucker like Tucker Carlson and not kill yourself

4552
03:50:19,180 --> 03:50:25,220
so I think Daria is just a stone cold fucking psychopath you can say that and I mean like

4553
03:50:25,220 --> 03:50:30,740
obviously you're violating the Goldwater rule yes I am I think that some of these answers

4554
03:50:30,740 --> 03:50:39,180
and you know this trend that you see of like kind of what if we pretend everything is good

4555
03:50:39,180 --> 03:50:46,580
I think that it's it's a bizarre way to engage with the world and it does kind of at least

4556
03:50:46,580 --> 03:50:54,740
speak to that difference that that dynamic yeah of Alex knows what is expected of him

4557
03:50:54,740 --> 03:51:00,620
right to appear normal in order to be yeah and Daria doesn't care she doesn't need to

4558
03:51:00,620 --> 03:51:06,140
know because she's not somebody who's forward-facing no and she's not named in the lawsuit I guess

4559
03:51:06,140 --> 03:51:09,740
she'll be out of job she will be out of a job but that was gonna happen anyway probably

4560
03:51:09,740 --> 03:51:15,260
yeah so now we get her response to the email about the stalking where how big showed up

4561
03:51:15,260 --> 03:51:20,060
at these people's house right and was talking about talking to their neighbors right and

4562
03:51:20,060 --> 03:51:24,660
I wonder what her responses that email didn't creep you out you personally

4563
03:51:24,660 --> 03:51:34,900
creepy out the way you're reading it yes

4564
03:51:34,900 --> 03:51:38,100
then creepy out to have Wolfgang havoc showing up these people's houses and describing their

4565
03:51:38,100 --> 03:51:42,060
three-car garage and all that stuff accusing them of being people they're not actually

4566
03:51:42,060 --> 03:51:45,900
are that doesn't that doesn't have any you know how many strong feelings one way or another

4567
03:51:45,900 --> 03:51:56,300
on that action form

4568
03:51:56,300 --> 03:51:57,300
correct

4569
03:51:57,300 --> 03:52:06,300
are you asking my personal opinion yeah your personal opinion strikes me as a passionate

4570
03:52:06,300 --> 03:52:11,300
man who's doing an investigation something he believes in his own heart and wants to

4571
03:52:11,300 --> 03:52:19,260
get to the bottom of that's a mic down that's a drop that's the type of psychopathic response

4572
03:52:19,260 --> 03:52:24,020
that CEOs give to fucking Congress where you're like oh you guys just are willing to watch

4573
03:52:24,020 --> 03:52:28,000
the humanity explode but you don't give a fuck but that response remarked that thank

4574
03:52:28,000 --> 03:52:33,960
you oh yeah is like a like beautiful it's it's almost like you can tell it's a containing

4575
03:52:33,960 --> 03:52:39,940
of elation yeah like I can't believe you said something that's gonna be so like so damaged

4576
03:52:39,940 --> 03:52:45,580
yeah yeah so again Dari is steadfastly refusing to see like these negative things in what

4577
03:52:45,580 --> 03:52:49,660
how big did the other email was concerned about the cleanliness of the school and this

4578
03:52:49,660 --> 03:52:54,380
one you know this this one's a passionate investigator that's how they rationalize this

4579
03:52:54,380 --> 03:52:58,940
I think that probably feels like good spin at the moment but this is a huge mistake because

4580
03:52:58,940 --> 03:53:02,120
in a deposition setting you need to be considering that your words are going to be played for

4581
03:53:02,120 --> 03:53:07,220
a jury and you should account for them having basic human emotions anyone in the jury who

4582
03:53:07,220 --> 03:53:12,260
reads or hears that email is gonna be disgusted by how big sections because it's clearly a

4583
03:53:12,260 --> 03:53:17,540
man stalking grieving families and when they see you making excuses for it or characterizing

4584
03:53:17,540 --> 03:53:22,260
it as just a passionate investigator that's gonna look really bad for you is it gives

4585
03:53:22,260 --> 03:53:26,580
the strong impression that you're either lying to cover something up or maybe you actually

4586
03:53:26,580 --> 03:53:31,420
don't think that how big stalking these families was that bad a thing for him to have done

4587
03:53:31,420 --> 03:53:34,900
so I have some suspicion that Alex is smart enough to realize that dynamic which could

4588
03:53:34,900 --> 03:53:39,140
help explain why he had the responses to those emails that's congruent with how you would

4589
03:53:39,140 --> 03:53:44,540
want the jury to see you and and how you know the jury is going to respond to them and I

4590
03:53:44,540 --> 03:53:49,520
don't even necessarily know where like that's a conscious decision but it might just be

4591
03:53:49,520 --> 03:53:56,380
like Alex gets that I love the way that Mark set up these emails because you could have

4592
03:53:56,380 --> 03:53:59,780
you could have set it up in a different in a different fashion and made some different

4593
03:53:59,780 --> 03:54:04,080
points but I just love the fact that it's it's like a limbo bar for empathy that he

4594
03:54:04,080 --> 03:54:10,020
keeps raising you know like that first one if you don't see that as monstrous you know

4595
03:54:10,020 --> 03:54:16,020
wow you just smacked the the fucking limbo bar Mark then raises the limbo bar up a thousand

4596
03:54:16,020 --> 03:54:20,620
feet of true monstrous behavior and she's like I bet I can hit that bar and that limbo

4597
03:54:20,620 --> 03:54:26,940
bar is really just asking like that's bad right yes hey hey you know if somebody were

4598
03:54:26,940 --> 03:54:31,580
lit on fire that would be a bad thing right do you agree with that yeah so there's a bunch

4599
03:54:31,580 --> 03:54:38,000
of questions that come up about figuring out the size of the audience trying to gauge metrics

4600
03:54:38,000 --> 03:54:42,880
and traffic and sure basically it all just boils down to Daria having like I didn't do

4601
03:54:42,880 --> 03:54:49,620
anything to figure out no okay okay great great good work then we're hours into this

4602
03:54:49,620 --> 03:54:56,660
deposition of course this question is damning you understand that the company produced documents

4603
03:54:56,660 --> 03:55:01,140
from its own corporate files right okay and you understand that some of those document

4604
03:55:01,140 --> 03:55:06,820
requests asked for documents about my clients right yes do you know who my clients are can

4605
03:55:06,820 --> 03:55:15,860
you name them I have four clients do you know who they're yeah yo it's on the notice I know

4606
03:55:15,860 --> 03:55:22,220
you I mean from memory you don't you got to pull this up right yes okay oh yeah the corporate

4607
03:55:22,220 --> 03:55:27,340
representative you don't know the names of the people suing you four and a half five

4608
03:55:27,340 --> 03:55:32,300
hours into this deposition do you know why we're here it's rank disrespect yeah to not

4609
03:55:32,300 --> 03:55:36,660
even take this seriously enough to know like even if you don't want to know their names

4610
03:55:36,660 --> 03:55:42,060
as people you right maybe be aware of the names of the cases right you know no I mean

4611
03:55:42,060 --> 03:55:49,380
this is one of those things it's it's easy to laugh at how terrible they are in these

4612
03:55:49,380 --> 03:55:54,740
depositions you know it is very easy because they're garbage and they're they're just dumb

4613
03:55:54,740 --> 03:56:01,300
on a on an astronomical scale but when you do hear that it just it reminds me all over

4614
03:56:01,300 --> 03:56:06,380
again like that's why it's fine for them that's why they don't care is because they never

4615
03:56:06,380 --> 03:56:10,900
cared that's why they will always go find another sandy hook because they don't care

4616
03:56:10,900 --> 03:56:15,460
what the names are of the people who are going to bankrupt their fucking business they didn't

4617
03:56:15,460 --> 03:56:20,020
even bother to know well because most of the time they won't end up bankrupt but that's

4618
03:56:20,020 --> 03:56:24,540
that's what I'm saying that's why it has to be it has to be a bankruptcy I see I see where

4619
03:56:24,540 --> 03:56:29,460
you're coming from yeah so we only have a couple more clips left and one of the things

4620
03:56:29,460 --> 03:56:36,140
that was really mysterious and the Alex deposition is the questions about the giant background

4621
03:56:36,140 --> 03:56:39,940
check of Leonard Posner yeah yeah so this comes up see if we can get some more answers

4622
03:56:39,940 --> 03:56:46,500
on this one yeah so in terms of the document the single document that was recently produced

4623
03:56:46,500 --> 03:56:50,500
to me about Leonard Posner you've never seen it and this is the single document that's

4624
03:56:50,500 --> 03:56:59,020
it mm-hmm okay you see where it says FSX TX dash eight zero eight five five four four

4625
03:56:59,020 --> 03:57:05,340
yes okay you don't know what this is do you if I want to ask you what is this you couldn't

4626
03:57:05,340 --> 03:57:11,380
tell me just like the background information right I mean I can figure that out right like

4627
03:57:11,380 --> 03:57:15,700
we can look at the top at the table of contents right here and it says for license investigator

4628
03:57:15,700 --> 03:57:20,140
purposes only do you see where it says that and then you see where it says Leonard Posner

4629
03:57:20,140 --> 03:57:25,020
comprehensive report yes do you see where it has all these entries about all this information

4630
03:57:25,020 --> 03:57:31,020
about Leonard Posner yes this is a lot of knowledge that the company has in its possession

4631
03:57:31,020 --> 03:57:35,980
concerning the new posner you'd agree with that yes okay and some of the information

4632
03:57:35,980 --> 03:57:39,920
that the company has about Leonard Posner and its knowledge include his possible relatives

4633
03:57:39,920 --> 03:57:46,060
right do you see that down near the bottom of the list yes and possible likely associates

4634
03:57:46,060 --> 03:57:50,940
and possible associates right yes okay and like for instance if we go to do you see where

4635
03:57:50,940 --> 03:58:06,460
it says page 66 for possible relatives can you flip to page 66 in that document for me

4636
03:58:06,460 --> 03:58:12,020
there's a bunch of people's personal information isn't it yes and you can't tell me why the

4637
03:58:12,020 --> 03:58:23,580
company has this can you I don't know no one has any idea I I listen to these and I just

4638
03:58:23,580 --> 03:58:29,420
wonder like who could answer that question I know I I mean I genuinely believe them when

4639
03:58:29,420 --> 03:58:34,140
they say they have no idea why they have it I would I suspect that I mean I don't have

4640
03:58:34,140 --> 03:58:40,460
any reason to believe that they are lying about yeah I mean but it's who who knows like

4641
03:58:40,460 --> 03:58:47,220
who does know I'm not saying who knows I mean who knows I will tell you who knows Rob you

4642
03:58:47,220 --> 03:58:58,100
know who it is David Jones oh let's get him in oh let's go get that guy the the the HR

4643
03:58:58,100 --> 03:59:03,060
not anymore though oh well that was actually a question that came up during Alex's deposition

4644
03:59:03,060 --> 03:59:07,660
his dad is no longer HR and it turns out that it might not be that crazy that he was HR

4645
03:59:07,660 --> 03:59:13,420
to begin with because he did some human resources for the dental company that he was a part

4646
03:59:13,420 --> 03:59:20,520
of prior to this so there may be actually some tip of the cap either way so this last

4647
03:59:20,520 --> 03:59:25,420
clip is not where the actual deposition ends but I would say it's where it kind of spiritually

4648
03:59:25,420 --> 03:59:33,340
ends okay and that is in an exchange where so I gotta give a little bit of a context

4649
03:59:33,340 --> 03:59:39,540
I guess to this in the Connecticut cases there's a guy named Cory Slanka who's basically is

4650
03:59:39,540 --> 03:59:44,820
a partner of Wolfgang Halbig's an associate and some of the nonsense that he was into

4651
03:59:44,820 --> 03:59:51,220
and so part of the request for production of documents in these cases in Texas involved

4652
03:59:51,220 --> 03:59:58,900
anything involving Cory Slanka Slanka that's hard that is hard Slanka yeah so they obviously

4653
03:59:58,900 --> 04:00:04,580
would know that there are documents involved because he's a co-defendant in the case in

4654
04:00:04,580 --> 04:00:09,820
Connecticut they would know that yes so Mark and these lawyers would know that there is

4655
04:00:09,820 --> 04:00:14,680
something that would be respondent in that request for documents well if they had done

4656
04:00:14,680 --> 04:00:19,780
their research but of course nothing came up and nothing was delivered and so this is

4657
04:00:19,780 --> 04:00:24,880
this is where I think you can tell throughout this that there's a sense of growing frustration

4658
04:00:24,880 --> 04:00:29,380
with dealing with this deposition yeah and this is kind of where I feel like well this

4659
04:00:29,380 --> 04:00:39,460
is this is you know what are we even doing you know Cory Sklenka is right no okay um

4660
04:00:39,460 --> 04:00:43,260
Cory Sklenka is an associate of Wolfgang Halbig who is a co-defendant with N-4s in the Lafferty

4661
04:00:43,260 --> 04:00:48,260
suit does that refresh your memory on who Cory Sklenka is no no not really okay the

4662
04:00:48,260 --> 04:00:51,600
you would admit being a co-defendant with Cory Sklenka in the Lafferty suit the company

4663
04:00:51,600 --> 04:00:57,840
possesses documents about Cory Sklenka correct objection form nothing to do with the Texas

4664
04:00:57,840 --> 04:01:03,000
cases here it has to do with the documents produced in response to our discovery requests

4665
04:01:03,000 --> 04:01:07,020
and our discovery requests were Cory Sklenka which you would know if you ever answered

4666
04:01:07,020 --> 04:01:11,940
okay I'm Brett this is the most disrespectful deposition I've ever been in I don't we've

4667
04:01:11,940 --> 04:01:15,300
been in two depositions where you presented the same your company's printed the same kind

4668
04:01:15,300 --> 04:01:18,940
of opponent who didn't know anything about what was being on these topics and now for

4669
04:01:18,940 --> 04:01:23,760
you to come in and object to topics about I'm asking about documents produced to my

4670
04:01:23,760 --> 04:01:28,660
discovery request and you tell me Cory Sklenka is a is a response of this case I both of

4671
04:01:28,660 --> 04:01:32,960
you all need to get up to speed on what this case is about first of all I am objecting

4672
04:01:32,960 --> 04:01:37,460
on the basis of you asking about the Connecticut litigation I'm not asking I'm not saying you

4673
04:01:37,460 --> 04:01:42,580
have any I'm not objecting to you asking any questions about your discovery requests second

4674
04:01:42,580 --> 04:01:47,460
of all no one is trying to be disrespectful here she's doing her best job and I don't

4675
04:01:47,460 --> 04:01:51,260
care whether you think she isn't or not I don't really care what your personal opinions

4676
04:01:51,260 --> 04:01:55,820
are on her or not if you have a problem with it with I'm sure you you obviously do you're

4677
04:01:55,820 --> 04:02:00,120
gonna try to do something about it no I'm going to and I and I and I want you to maintain

4678
04:02:00,120 --> 04:02:04,860
for the record that everyone here has been working as hard as they can to actually get

4679
04:02:04,860 --> 04:02:08,620
you answers that you want and I'm sorry that out of the hundreds of thousands of pages

4680
04:02:08,620 --> 04:02:12,420
of documents that you're asking about specific ones that she doesn't have the exact answer

4681
04:02:12,420 --> 04:02:16,580
to you haven't produced hundreds of thousands of pages okay man you know what I'm not answered

4682
04:02:16,580 --> 04:02:19,820
discovery Brad so if you're gonna sit here and lecture me I would like you to show me

4683
04:02:19,820 --> 04:02:23,980
the ones you're saying have not been responded to what's up which ones are you saying have

4684
04:02:23,980 --> 04:02:27,740
not been responded to you haven't responded to the positive discovery you know shape or

4685
04:02:27,740 --> 04:02:32,300
form and and the others have you have I been compelled by a court order to actually respond

4686
04:02:32,300 --> 04:02:36,300
to those documents because I got defaulted but I haven't actually seen a motion to compel

4687
04:02:36,300 --> 04:02:42,260
right and I'm proving all that up right now I understand that but what I'm I'm I'm unclear

4688
04:02:42,260 --> 04:02:46,980
on if I'm defaulted on it and I'm unclear of the obligation to actually supplement it

4689
04:02:46,980 --> 04:02:50,700
but if you if you want to ask me to do that then I'll do that I'm not asking that at all

4690
04:02:50,700 --> 04:02:56,140
I'm asking her directly that they haven't produced me documents to my discovery request

4691
04:02:56,140 --> 04:02:59,860
and I want them to admit that they refuse to answer them and you've just kept interrupting

4692
04:02:59,860 --> 04:03:03,900
me okay well I'm sorry I didn't mean to interrupt you I apologize that's not my intent and I

4693
04:03:03,900 --> 04:03:09,700
will go ahead and answer the question to thee since you can please right wow yeah it was

4694
04:03:09,700 --> 04:03:19,100
not hard to make that teenaged boy fall down that that was was really oh man I found that

4695
04:03:19,100 --> 04:03:23,980
a bit tough because it is like obviously the boiling over frustration sure like dealing

4696
04:03:23,980 --> 04:03:29,320
with this nonsense everyone there knows what's going on they're furious and and the the response

4697
04:03:29,320 --> 04:03:36,180
of Brad being like yeah this is everyone's doing the best they can I I'm sorry just I'm

4698
04:03:36,180 --> 04:03:42,580
sorry it's just kind of such a perfect button to end on kind of of these of these depositions

4699
04:03:42,580 --> 04:03:48,900
it's like no everyone is not doing the best job Brad Brad Brad Brad I mean he's their

4700
04:03:48,900 --> 04:03:55,260
lawyer I just you can't you can't be a fucking lawyer for a goddamn corporate representative

4701
04:03:55,260 --> 04:04:01,480
and come at me with what my mom would say if I got a C and my dad was pissed he's doing

4702
04:04:01,480 --> 04:04:09,400
his best shut the fuck up yeah unreal so I think we we I mean we're almost I mean probably

4703
04:04:09,400 --> 04:04:15,660
I mean including we're probably over four hours well yeah probably about that um unsurprising

4704
04:04:15,660 --> 04:04:22,540
so I think one of the one of the unfortunate things about this is that obviously there

4705
04:04:22,540 --> 04:04:27,700
is you know the Alex deposition is like three hours long and the Daria ones sit like five

4706
04:04:27,700 --> 04:04:32,340
hours long and you know there are things that we just obviously couldn't cover everything

4707
04:04:32,340 --> 04:04:36,520
right right so there are little other tidbits that are that are you know of interest and

4708
04:04:36,520 --> 04:04:41,820
obviously for someone like me it's like everything is it was catnip yeah there's yeah there's

4709
04:04:41,820 --> 04:04:45,320
a ton of stuff that I would sit you here for 12 hours and talk to you about you really

4710
04:04:45,320 --> 04:04:51,420
would if if I felt like it was an acceptable thing if you felt like you could survive the

4711
04:04:51,420 --> 04:04:57,220
encounter I don't think I could I think that your patients would wear thin right about

4712
04:04:57,220 --> 04:05:04,140
four hours and two minutes that's that's about where is that where we are now pretty close

4713
04:05:04,140 --> 04:05:12,580
I don't know so I I find I found these uh really illuminating in many ways I think I

4714
04:05:12,580 --> 04:05:19,860
think that obviously the the Daria one as a corporate representative is it's not as

4715
04:05:19,860 --> 04:05:27,420
funny as Dew maybe and maybe that's because Dew was wearing the Kangol hat yeah well and he seemed

4716
04:05:27,420 --> 04:05:35,060
scared he yeah I mean he he was much more scared and he also had kind of a an almost

4717
04:05:35,060 --> 04:05:40,840
laissez-faire attitude about it too of like hey if I know something I'll tell you but

4718
04:05:40,840 --> 04:05:45,180
if I don't know something I'm just gonna say I don't know man his fear and confusion made

4719
04:05:45,180 --> 04:05:51,620
it funny yeah whereas Daria's lack of preparation as clearly demonstrated yeah in the deposition

4720
04:05:51,620 --> 04:05:56,100
it didn't have the same humor and the things that were interesting about it were upsetting

4721
04:05:56,100 --> 04:06:01,660
terrifying things that she said were deeply deeply upsetting no no no no I I mean yeah

4722
04:06:01,660 --> 04:06:10,900
that's wow it's you know that okay it's like that psychopath test thing you know I'm sorry

4723
04:06:10,900 --> 04:06:17,980
to bring up John twice but it is like that story of you know like oh this this psychopath

4724
04:06:17,980 --> 04:06:22,100
goes to a funeral meet somebody cool and they're like how do you meet him again and the psychopath

4725
04:06:22,100 --> 04:06:26,680
thinks oh you kill somebody that you only meet them at funerals that is exactly what

4726
04:06:26,680 --> 04:06:32,540
I felt whenever Daria heard the email about Wolfgang fucking stalking people and she was

4727
04:06:32,540 --> 04:06:37,900
like oh it's nice to know somebody cares about you and he's committed you are terrified committed

4728
04:06:37,900 --> 04:06:45,180
reporter you are terrified passionate yeah it's it these answers are incredibly bizarre

4729
04:06:45,180 --> 04:06:51,740
and I think that certainly something that I wasn't as aware of before is the content

4730
04:06:51,740 --> 04:06:58,220
of some of those emails that are just deeply upsetting fucked up and the the relationship

4731
04:06:58,220 --> 04:07:03,340
between the times that like when these emails are getting sent when the harassment's being

4732
04:07:03,340 --> 04:07:09,540
done yeah when there's you know pretty strong indications of negligence and just ignoring

4733
04:07:09,540 --> 04:07:16,820
what what they're doing and who they're promoting yeah it just it just looks really bad no it

4734
04:07:16,820 --> 04:07:21,260
does not look good does not so I'm glad to be on the other side of this I'm glad that

4735
04:07:21,260 --> 04:07:26,060
now we can you know it's out in the open it is lovely it's a little bit of a weight off

4736
04:07:26,060 --> 04:07:31,900
my shoulders yeah you're not good with secrets no certainly not but I am proud of you know

4737
04:07:31,900 --> 04:07:36,560
not tipping the hand at all you should be it was I mean we're almost two months now

4738
04:07:36,560 --> 04:07:42,980
I know no it's I'm proud of you for for not tipping the hand but more proud of you for

4739
04:07:42,980 --> 04:07:47,340
doing it and all that stuff I'm not gonna compliment you please mark already did that

4740
04:07:47,340 --> 04:07:55,580
shit up top I'm just gonna say good work thanks Barnes yeah so hey I guess that that brings

4741
04:07:55,580 --> 04:08:00,500
us to the end of this but I think we may have another episode that's sort of deposition

4742
04:08:00,500 --> 04:08:06,340
ish next because of Alex going to the gym we'll see what happens yeah so we look forward
