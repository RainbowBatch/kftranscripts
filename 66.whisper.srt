1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,300
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan, I love your work.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:07,800
I love you.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,600
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,100
I'm Jordan!

6
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,400
We are a couple dudes who like to sit around and drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,500
Is there a twist today, unspecific to the twists of yesterday?

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,700
Uh, pfft, I don't know what that is.

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,900
I don't know, I was trying to go with yesteryear and I was like, we haven't been doing this for-

10
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:24,700
Strange phrasing.

11
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,800
Yestermonth? I don't know, I got nothing.

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,600
Today's novelty beverage is red wine.

13
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,700
Hahahaha!

14
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:35,000
We are going back to our roots, the show originally was us drinking wine and talking about Alex Jones,

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,700
we had to settle that down for a little bit, but we wanted to go back to the roots!

16
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:45,000
Uh, and the reason was given to me by Dan as, we're gonna need to drink wine for this one.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,100
We might need to brace ourselves, steal our reserves.

18
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:48,800
Right, right, right.

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,800
That's not the expression, but-

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,300
No.

21
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,600
Um, look, I think that we've been getting-

22
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,000
Steal our reserves.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,600
You know, we got a lot of food squared away, we need to cover it in steel.

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,100
Right, and you know nothing about Alex Jones.

25
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,600
I don't know anything about Alex Jones.

26
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,800
Premise of the show, I know a lot about Alex Jones, Jordan over there does not know much about him.

27
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,300
I'm just excited we're drinking again.

28
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:05,800
Amen.

29
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:11,900
Uh, one of the reasons was I was listening back to our last episode and I realized I was way too mad about, uh,

30
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,600
the people who were posting the Bon Iver video meme of Alex Jones because-

31
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,700
You were very pissed.

32
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,100
I was right, but I was-

33
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,700
Hahahaha!

34
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,300
I was way too mad.

35
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,400
And I don't like that, I wanna- that's not what this show's supposed to be.

36
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,900
I don't wanna turn into some Alex Jones facsimile where I'm screaming and everybody's doing this wrong and all this.

37
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,700
Oh, that's true.

38
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,800
I felt really, like, self-conscious about it and I'm like, well, the only solution is let's get drunk.

39
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,200
Well, and I mean, I have actually been having the same kind of thoughts recently where it's like,

40
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,900
are we just becoming the anti-Alex Jones?

41
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:50,900
Like, there's been a couple of things where I've noticed, like, listening back, uh, it's like,

42
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,700
oh, that's exactly what he does.

43
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,900
But we don't build up false narratives for a specific purpose.

44
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,200
You know, like, I don't think we do that.

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,400
But we tear down false narratives for a specific purpose.

46
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,300
Which is-

47
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,200
So we're just the anti-Alex Jones.

48
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,400
We're tearing down those narratives for the sake of tearing them down because they're lies.

49
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:06,700
Right.

50
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,500
So I think it's okay-

51
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,300
We're like Reagan.

52
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,000
Right.

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,500
Tear down that lie wall.

54
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,300
Um, but, uh, to get back to that-

55
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,900
God, I hope David Hasselhoff closes out this episode.

56
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,700
He definitely will, he comes in on the money bomb.

57
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,700
Really? Okay.

58
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,200
Hahahaha!

59
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,700
So, uh, like, I want to also say that, like I said-

60
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,900
And now we have Baywatch star David Hasselhoff.

61
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,400
And, uh, D'Errico.

62
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,700
Donald D'Errico on backup vocals.

63
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:37,000
Um, I want to say that about that, uh, Bon Iver video, I'm totally right.

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,200
Uh, Alex Jones just announced-

65
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,100
That's twice we have confirmed Dan is right.

66
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,400
Uh, self-confirmed.

67
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,600
Well, Alex Jones, uh, just at the end of last week-

68
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,100
That's true.

69
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:53,100
He announced a $20,000 contest for people to make parody versions of this parody song about him.

70
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,600
Yep.

71
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,900
And that's what I'm saying he's going to do, that's what he does all the time with this shit.

72
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,400
No, you have been proven right, but, uh, you know, it's a little gauche to talk about it yourself.

73
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,600
You should've given me a little cue-

74
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,100
Calm down.

75
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,600
I would've been like, Dan, you're so right.

76
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:16,600
The reason I brought it up and maybe forced a self-congratulatory note is because I know exactly what the plan is for what this contest is going to achieve.

77
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:24,600
He's basically going to have all the- I mean, he's posted all the lyrics of the parody song on his website, on Infowars.com.

78
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:32,600
And what he's going to have people do, and the winner who ends up winning this $10,000 of the $20,000, because it's broken down, it's three prizes.

79
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,100
One for best parody, uh, that's $10,000.

80
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:36,600
Right.

81
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,600
$5,000 will be awarded to the person who films it in the weirdest- or best location.

82
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Their video is in the- I don't know what that means.

83
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,600
My-

84
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,100
Congress?

85
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:45,600
Is that a-

86
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,100
I don't know.

87
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,600
Is that a way to avoid paying out that $5,000?

88
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,100
Probably.

89
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

90
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,100
So, but like, I know what he's going to do.

91
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,600
All the lyrics are there-

92
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,100
My sex dungeon is the weirdest location.

93
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:56,600
It's super weird.

94
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,600
Yeah, that's super weird, but I'm not giving you five grand for it.

95
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:10,100
It is a way that he is going to essentially get people to try and reinforce the lines in that song that people are making fun of.

96
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,600
Yeah.

97
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:17,600
So it'll be like, uh, we love our Somalis, and then, you know, flash up on the screen something about how Somalis kill people.

98
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,100
Yeah.

99
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:23,600
It's going to be a thing where he takes his propaganda and it's reinforced through the use of that parody song.

100
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,100
Right.

101
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,600
It's like, oh, they're making fun of all this stuff.

102
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,600
All of it's true.

103
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,100
They do want to eat babies.

104
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:28,600
Yeah.

105
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,100
Stuff like that.

106
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,600
And it's like, you guys are fighting a losing battle.

107
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,600
So, anyway, it's going to be a bummer.

108
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,600
But the good news is way less people will see that parody version than the Bon Iver version.

109
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,100
That's definitely true.

110
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,600
So there's something to be said for that.

111
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
I don't know.

112
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,100
Let's get into greener pastures and happy things. I'd like to give a shout out to a couple of new donators.

113
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,600
Oh, shit. A couple?

114
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,600
That's right. I'd like to give a shout out to our new friend, Rex. What's going on out there?

115
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
I'm a policy wonk.

116
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Thank you for donating, Rex.

117
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,600
If you're Rex Tillerson, you have to let us know.

118
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,100
It's not. It's Rex.

119
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,100
How dare you, Rex Tillerson?

120
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,600
It's Rex from our favorite pro wrestling themed punk band, the Razor Ramones.

121
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,100
Alright, well then, never mind, Rex. I'm a huge fan of yours.

122
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,600
Yeah, you're the best Rex of the Rexes we've mentioned.

123
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,600
Also, I'd like to give a shout out to our other new donator. What's up, Anthony?

124
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
I'm a policy wonk.

125
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Welcome aboard.

126
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,600
If that's Anthony Wiener, I'm just going to do this every single time you give a first name.

127
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,600
It's actually Anthony Kumiya, host of the fourth hour of the Alex Jones program periodically.

128
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
I don't know.

129
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
Anyway, Jordan, let's get things started.

130
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,600
I like the idea that Infowars employees actually stealth donate to us.

131
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,600
Just going like, please get us out of this. He won't let us leave.

132
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
He won't let us leave. Just take him down. Somebody.

133
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
Only you can destroy him.

134
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,600
Today, we're going to be going over Investigation, the eleventh installment of the Investigation,

135
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,600
where we go through 2015 and find out what the fuck happened to make Alex Jones go crazy.

136
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,600
And today, we'll be going through September 6th to September 17th.

137
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,600
This is, this is inexplicable, right?

138
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,600
Like, when did this, this started in June?

139
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
What, our, yeah, yeah, yeah.

140
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Our investigation began June 15th, the day that Donald Trump announced his candidacy.

141
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,600
How is this still, how is this still going on? Shouldn't it be over by now?

142
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
It's very, I expected it to be.

143
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,600
Like, especially with his, his full on, like, now he's, he's going,

144
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,600
sovereignty, sovereignty, sir, blah, blah, blah, you know, that whole thing.

145
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,600
You mean in 2017?

146
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

147
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,600
Shouldn't he be, shouldn't he be on the train by now?

148
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
What's going on?

149
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,600
You'd think he would have made some sort of substantial move, and we just have not seen that yet.

150
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,600
No, not at all!

151
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,600
No, today we're going to be going over, like I said, September 6th to the 17th.

152
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,600
The reason that's important is the end of his big money bomb, which we've discussed,

153
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:47,600
and it's what I have speculated is the opportunity for bizarro money to come flowing into the show.

154
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

155
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,600
I think that might, I have speculated that might be the case. I don't know, we'll see.

156
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:58,600
So does he get into, like, a tube and a lot of one dollar bills kind of get vacuumed around him?

157
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,600
You know, like one of those shows?

158
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,600
The big air jets?

159
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

160
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,600
It would be better.

161
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,600
He has to grab as many of them as he can in order to...

162
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,600
Not Larry Nichols, I know you have lung cancer, but get in the tube.

163
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,600
If you want your bills covered, get in the tube.

164
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
I don't know. It would be better.

165
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,600
That's way more fun than, don't give out ten thousand dollar prizes.

166
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,600
No.

167
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,600
Apply somebody out, put them in a tube, and throw one dollar bills at them the whole time.

168
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,600
That'd be perfect.

169
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,600
That'd be great.

170
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,600
I would be way more happy with that than ten grand.

171
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,600
I probably would, too, for the story, for the experience.

172
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, of course.

173
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,600
Money's just money. You can't take it with you when you go.

174
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,600
And seeing as how we're all going in, like, ten to fifteen years max.

175
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,600
Oh, that seems high.

176
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
Oh, yeah.

177
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:42,600
But you know what? Before we go, before we die, everyone needs to listen to this out of context drop from Alex Jones.

178
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,600
God bless you, man. I'm sorry for your son.

179
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,600
They didn't get his soul, though.

180
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:55,600
And see, I don't know how that works when they brain damage a baby, and they never obtain full consciousness.

181
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,600
I guess that soul just ends up when they die going right to God, so in a way it's a reprieve.

182
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,600
I can't judge.

183
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,600
See, the globalists know a lot of this stuff.

184
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:13,600
I wonder if they wouldn't be killing, brain killing kids, soft killing them, mind killing them, if they thought they weren't still getting the soul, because that's what they really want.

185
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:20,600
So maybe they think when they're all brain damaged and get all crazed and then get older that they'll get smart enough to get corrupted and maybe possessed.

186
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:26,600
I don't know. I mean, I'm trying to figure out why these demons, from whatever dimension they come from, want to brain damage the kids.

187
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Because I know God doesn't damn people to hell that never were conscious.

188
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,600
I don't know. It's just food for thought.

189
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,600
Food for thought.

190
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,600
Why is that food for thought?

191
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,600
I don't know.

192
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:43,600
Also, I love the mind killer reference to Gang Gang Dance. Everybody knows that.

193
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,600
I'm certain that's what it was.

194
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Yeah, exactly. It's a great song.

195
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,600
Jordan, I completely fucked up.

196
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,600
I know. The Bon Iver video was great.

197
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,600
No, I forgot that I had another thing I wanted to discuss before we got into our main episode.

198
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,600
So guys, forgive me, but I have another clip that we need to listen to, because it's great.

199
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,600
Recently, I don't have permission to play this, but I'm going to anyway. I hope he doesn't sue me.

200
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,600
All right.

201
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,600
Recently, Jimmy Pardo on Never Not Funny had Tom Arnold as a guest.

202
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,600
And Tom Arnold had a very interesting story about some of the people that are involved in our universe.

203
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,600
Okay.

204
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Alex Jones comes up in this clip.

205
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Yeah.

206
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Mike Cernovich comes up in this clip.

207
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,600
And alleged Nazi Jesse James comes up in this clip.

208
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
This, when I heard this...

209
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
Sandra Bullock, also alleged Nazi.

210
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,600
No, no, no, no, no, no.

211
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Come on.

212
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,600
When I heard this, I squealed with delight, and I want to play this.

213
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,600
For those of you out in the world who do not have Never Not Funny, don't get the episodes.

214
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,600
Please enjoy Tom Arnold being cool as shit.

215
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,600
Well, here's what happened. Here's last week.

216
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:55,600
This alt-right guy, white supremacist guy, challenges me to a fight.

217
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,600
He's like, oh, I'd go good. We'll do it for a charity, because I do these charity boxing matches.

218
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,600
I found my old rabbi who made 300 grand for Ben Teshuvah.

219
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,600
I go, I will fight you for money.

220
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Good. We'll take your fans.

221
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,600
And then all of a sudden this guy named Jesse James horns in and says, I'll represent Mike Cernovich, is the guy's name.

222
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,600
Oh, that idiot.

223
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Yeah, yeah.

224
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,600
And Jesse James goes, I will fight Tom Arnold as a pussy. I'll fight.

225
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,600
And I go, wait a minute.

226
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:27,600
Are you the Jesse James that cheated on his awesome wife with the stripper with the swastika tattoo and lost his family?

227
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Because there's a lot of Jesse James out there. I don't know who's who. Apparently it was.

228
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,600
I go, oh, good. That'll be even better, because I know I'll kick your ass.

229
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,600
And by the way, that'll make us more money, so let's do this thing.

230
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,600
Okay.

231
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,600
And so then I get up. Joe Carter has a producer, director. He's helped set it up.

232
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,600
Like, this is really happening. We're going to do it at the Beverly Hilton.

233
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:54,600
We're going to make a million dollars to help Gold Star families and a post-traumatic stress organization.

234
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:04,600
It's great. It's great fun. And they go on that Infowars show with them and say I'm a pussy and whatever.

235
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,600
And they challenge me. I'm like, hey, they're promoting this. This is awesome.

236
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,600
And, you know, all his fans are kind of calling me names and this is just great, you know.

237
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,600
And then they puss out.

238
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Why do they puss out, Tom?

239
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:27,600
Oh, because they realized that everything they do, like Jesse James now sells guns.

240
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,600
And that service guy, he wrote a book called Guerrilla Man or something.

241
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Like, it's about, he says there's also this thing as day rape and, man, they're pussies now.

242
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:46,600
Everything they do, if they were on video getting their ass kicked by me, which wouldn't happen,

243
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:54,600
just like a rabbi, unfortunately, then everything they say means nothing.

244
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,600
And that's what will really happen. And so they would lose everything. So they wist out on that.

245
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,600
That's slightly different than the version that Mike Cernovich tells.

246
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,600
A little bit.

247
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Also, I believe it way more.

248
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Absolutely. Also, I'll tell you this, we get to use that clip, part of a headline to show that I was emceeing at Zany's.

249
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,600
And he talked shit about me for 20 minutes, so come at me, Pardo!

250
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,600
Sure. Alright, we got the implicit go-ahead.

251
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:31,600
Also, how great would that be if we just end up in some sort of bizarre feud about using a clip of Tom Arnold talking shit on Cernovich?

252
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:39,600
Ah, but I mean, there's a couple things in there that I fucking love, and that is that Tom Arnold does realize that Mike Cernovich,

253
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:46,600
going on Infowars and calling Tom Arnold a pussy after they had already agreed to have a celebrity boxing match,

254
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,600
is just another version of promotion. He gets it. He gets that.

255
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,600
Pro wrestling.

256
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,600
And he perfectly assesses why they couldn't follow through.

257
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:03,600
If Tom Arnold doesn't have his shit beat out of him, then, like you said, the whole game is over.

258
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,600
Even if it's close.

259
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,600
Like, oh.

260
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,600
Even if it's close, it's a disaster for Cernovich.

261
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:16,600
Imagine you got beat up by Tom Arnold. You got beat up by the star of The Stupids.

262
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,600
If I did, I wouldn't feel bad about it. It would probably be like, eh.

263
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,600
I would do it for the experience.

264
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
I probably would.

265
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,600
That would be fun.

266
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
Do I get to go into a money tube afterwards?

267
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,600
Anyway, I just like bringing... Yeah, you do.

268
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,600
His rabbi has that set up on the side of the stage.

269
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,600
Is that a stealth racist thing about Jews?

270
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,600
It wasn't, but now I realize it sounds bad. Oh well.

271
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:46,600
Anyway, I just like to bring up any time in pop culture we get evidence that these dudes are wack as fuck.

272
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,600
Yeah.

273
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Behind the scenes, they had already agreed to it, is what his point is.

274
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,600
And then they back out. That is the most beta cuck move you can do.

275
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,600
Especially Mike Cernovich challenging him and then getting biker Jesse James to stand in for him.

276
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,600
Right.

277
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
I use you as tribute.

278
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
Right, right, right.

279
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,600
Whatever, yeah.

280
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,600
Like some sort of Game of Thrones shit.

281
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
He wasn't calling the mountain, you know.

282
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,600
Yeah, exactly.

283
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,600
So, let's get to the episode, Jordan.

284
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,600
Yes, let's do it.

285
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,600
We've had our fun, now let's get shit-faced and talk shit.

286
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
Yeah.

287
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,600
We're going to start on September 6th.

288
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:27,600
And that is a Sunday show, so we know that Alex Jones likes to launch soft narratives on his Sunday shows.

289
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,600
And I feel like we've done a decent job of saying where we left off.

290
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,600
The money bomb is coming up. Alex Jones is clearly needing money at the end of the fiscal year.

291
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,600
He needs to try and raise a million dollars.

292
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:44,600
And at this point, he has only said basically that he likes what Trump is saying, but he doesn't trust him.

293
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,600
Still loves Rand Paul.

294
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,600
Yeah.

295
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,600
There we go. We're up to speed.

296
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,600
This September 6th, we're going to start exactly how Alex Jones starts the show.

297
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,600
Every day I start the broadcast and I'm just honest with you.

298
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,600
Wow, we got a lot of news.

299
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,600
And usually I cover about 20% of it.

300
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,600
That is honest.

301
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,600
Some days I cover 60, 70% of it.

302
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,600
Every once in a while I cover 90-something percent of it.

303
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,600
Nope.

304
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Usually you cover about...

305
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
Days, one of the days, I really should cover all of it.

306
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,600
Eight percent of it?

307
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,600
Maybe. Maybe eight.

308
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,600
Yeah. Maybe eight headboxes.

309
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,600
Because when you look at this world, there are two types of people when you boil it all down.

310
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,600
There's different subgroups, but there's dogs and there's cats.

311
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,600
All right. Well, kill yourself.

312
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,600
And I got this article right here at the National Post.

313
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,600
Your cat doesn't love you, scientific studies show.

314
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:33,600
I don't need a scientific study to show me that my cat, and I do have one cat and two dogs, does not love me.

315
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
Because no animal has ever loved you.

316
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,600
It only wants to pretend I'm its mother and make biscuits on my stomach in an infantile manner.

317
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,600
But it could care less if I fell down and died tomorrow.

318
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,600
It doesn't have anxiety when I'm gone, except it wants to bitch and gripe and ask for food.

319
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,600
It wants a free handout.

320
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,600
My dogs on the other hand would basically die and have heart attacks if something happened to me.

321
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
And that's clear.

322
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,600
And it's that spiritual connection.

323
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,600
It's that honorableness of the dog, which isn't perfect, but it has honor.

324
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,600
Silly and ignorant, but has guts and guts is enough, is why I'm a dog person and not a cat person.

325
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,600
Great.

326
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,600
What was that?

327
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,600
And people out there think they're getting ahead being cat people.

328
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,600
Oh, it's still going?

329
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,600
Folks that think they're getting ahead not caring about other folks.

330
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,600
You think you're cool, only caring about yourself.

331
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,600
You're an idiot.

332
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,600
Yeah.

333
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,600
It's like people that get in a hot tub and take a crap.

334
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,600
And I hate to be gross here, but you think of getting away with it.

335
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
Go to the bathroom.

336
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
Who are you hanging out with?

337
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,600
And you're crapping on everyone else, you're crapping on yourself.

338
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,600
And these are just elementary understandings here.

339
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,600
Cats are not pack animals unless you look at lions in Africa and they still feed on each other.

340
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,600
Unless you look at the cats who are pack animals.

341
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,600
Dogs are creatures of honor, first and foremost.

342
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,600
Amen.

343
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Amen.

344
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,600
If I had to have an archetypal totem animal, it would be the dog.

345
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,600
No.

346
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
Cats are cute.

347
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,600
Cats are funny.

348
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,600
But make no mistake, they won't be there for you when you're in a jam.

349
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,600
And if somebody comes in your house and attacks you, they're not going to stand up for you.

350
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,600
Dogs will.

351
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,600
You don't hear about cops going to people's houses and shooting their cats, do you?

352
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,600
It's the dog because they're not cowards.

353
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,600
Even if they're little or they're big, they stand up because they love you.

354
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,600
And our society is imploding because we're becoming a cat society, not a dog society.

355
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,600
So this is Alex Jones trying to make a point about the world,

356
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,600
while at the same time trying to work out some material for a weekend he's doing in a shitty club.

357
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,600
I was going to say, this is a shitty 80s hack bit, right?

358
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,600
Yeah, basically.

359
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Y'all know the difference between dogs and cats.

360
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,600
Yeah, man.

361
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,600
Cats on one side, they be like this.

362
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,600
Yeah.

363
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
Yeah, you said it.

364
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,600
Dogs over here, they be walking like this.

365
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,600
Oh, man, that's the truth.

366
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,600
Oh, God, I love Def Jam.

367
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,600
That's the truth.

368
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,600
I love Def Jam comedy.

369
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:51,600
That is like, that is terrible hacky nonsense.

370
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
Yeah.

371
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,600
And look, I got a cat.

372
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,600
I know she doesn't really love me, but we have a complicated kind of love.

373
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,600
You know, that's how cats and dogs are.

374
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,600
Dogs are simple.

375
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,600
Cats are complex.

376
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,600
There we go.

377
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,600
I don't know.

378
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,600
Now I'm getting into a hacky bit.

379
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,600
Yeah, damn, there's two kinds of people in the world.

380
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Oh, boy.

381
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,600
People who explain their love.

382
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,600
I don't know.

383
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,600
Who cares?

384
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,600
I got nothing for that.

385
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,600
That's dumb.

386
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,600
That's just dumb.

387
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,440
But that, I think, is an indication of how Alex often does, like, the Sunday shows are

388
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,840
low stakes for him.

389
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,840
Yeah.

390
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,820
He knows that not many people are watching, and so he just kind of fills time a lot of

391
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,940
the Sunday shows.

392
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:30,440
So why not start off the show with a five-minute riff about why don't cops kill cats when they

393
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,440
come to your house?

394
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,440
I forgot.

395
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,760
This is how he's starting the show.

396
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,760
Right out of the gate.

397
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,760
Right out of the gate.

398
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,760
Right out of the gate.

399
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,600
Look, sometimes I feel like I got to get into all of this news today.

400
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,600
Right.

401
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,600
He's talking about dog and cat people.

402
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
Yeah.

403
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,600
So he doesn't stay on that theme for very long, but he...

404
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,640
Now, does he feel the same way about dog chimeras and cat chimeras?

405
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,640
Interesting.

406
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,640
I don't know.

407
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,240
Do they take on the property?

408
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,560
This is a very good, this is groundbreaking questions for Alex.

409
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,560
Next week I'll call him to the show.

410
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:03,940
Do the animals take on the properties, or do the people take on the properties of the

411
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,000
animal that they're chimerad with?

412
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I think they would have to.

413
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Do you?

414
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,720
Yeah, I mean, there's got to be some sort of genetic influence from the host animal.

415
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,360
Yeah, but the fish people have, you know, sad human eyes.

416
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,560
You don't know that fish aren't sad all the time.

417
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,980
That could be a...

418
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,800
We have no idea about the psychology of fish.

419
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,800
I don't know.

420
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
They are pack animals.

421
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,680
I don't know if fish are sad all the time.

422
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,320
So Alex does not stay on this theme.

423
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,120
That would be a really depressing thing.

424
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,720
Scientists reveal that fish are all depressed all the time.

425
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,520
They're bummed out.

426
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,160
They like the flakes, but nothing else.

427
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,400
So Alex doesn't stay on this theme for very long.

428
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,400
He does...

429
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,260
Have you seen any cops killing your fish?

430
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,800
That's a good point.

431
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,440
He does get weird.

432
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,240
There's a couple of things he says on this show that I think are indefensibly weird.

433
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,880
And I don't think...

434
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,120
I don't think if pressed he could explain what the fuck he's talking about.

435
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,020
And here is the first of those clips.

436
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:02,040
And then they write books like Ecoscience and Bertrand Russell writes books from the

437
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,340
30s right through the 80s and the 90s bragging about it.

438
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:09,920
These people think they're gods and they say the public doesn't care.

439
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,480
We must have the right to do it.

440
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,480
You see...

441
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,480
Like you say...

442
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:20,320
At a spiritual, intergalactic level, at an interstellar level, there are rules just written

443
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,220
on the universe by God.

444
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:29,180
And if you don't protest something, if you don't say no to it, then you are acquiescing

445
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,720
and accepting it.

446
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,100
That's really weird.

447
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,920
On an interstellar level...

448
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,920
Intergalactically.

449
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,920
Intergalactic level.

450
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,920
I apologize.

451
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,920
Both.

452
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,920
He uses both of those words.

453
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,720
How do we feel about McConaughey?

454
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,560
He's great.

455
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,760
God wrote that rule on the universe.

456
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,320
McConaughey is pretty cool.

457
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,320
Just keep living.

458
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,320
Amen.

459
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,320
That's what we do here.

460
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,320
Yeah.

461
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,320
That's super bizarre.

462
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,960
He's basically expressing the belief that if you don't fight back against something,

463
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,120
you consent to it.

464
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,120
Yeah.

465
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,500
And I don't disagree with him.

466
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,560
I disagree with how he wants to direct that.

467
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:09,160
But he's denying the Nuremberg, the Nuremberg defense, basically.

468
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,360
How so?

469
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:19,400
Well, the idea that I was just taking orders is not an actual defense towards you putting

470
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,640
Jews into a concentration camp.

471
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,640
Right.

472
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,640
You know?

473
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,920
So, he is right.

474
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:30,560
And it's something that I've talked about, or I talked about recently, which is every

475
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:38,200
day that I'm not protesting the mistreatment of black people by fucking everything, I am

476
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,200
–

477
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,200
The police in particular.

478
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
Yeah.

479
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,120
I am implicitly consenting to allowing this kind of worldview to exist.

480
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,360
I think it's a little more complicated than that.

481
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,040
Well, that's because you're a cat person.

482
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:56,320
I don't think that there are universal rules and galactic rules that were written by God,

483
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,960
especially in the way that he's presenting it.

484
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,240
Because what he's saying is that these globalists, like Bertrand Russell and the eco-science

485
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,240
he references –

486
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,920
Yeah, I like how he's really bringing up the recent references.

487
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,560
You know, Bertrand Russell writing in the 30s.

488
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,560
Right.

489
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,900
And John P. Holdren's textbook Eco-Science, which you've discussed in the past, does

490
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,280
not say the things that it says.

491
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,600
He's saying that they are putting this out there.

492
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,960
They're giving the information of what they're doing to you.

493
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,920
And if you don't fight back, then you just accept it.

494
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,520
And that's cockamamie because he's lying about what those things say.

495
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,520
Yeah.

496
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,160
Eco-Science, the textbook, doesn't say that they're putting things in the water.

497
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,080
It doesn't say that they're trying to dumb down the population.

498
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,140
It has nothing to do with that stuff.

499
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,760
It's a fucking textbook.

500
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,440
And they just – we've been over it.

501
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,440
It doesn't matter.

502
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,440
Yeah.

503
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,440
Ugh, I hate him.

504
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,440
Anyway.

505
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,040
I'm still mad about the dog and cat thing.

506
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,040
I'll tell you that.

507
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,480
I couldn't even listen to that.

508
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,440
Listen, that might have been pretty weird.

509
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:55,280
Also, I'm telling you, Interstellar, the plot mechanics are not great.

510
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,280
Okay.

511
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,280
Great.

512
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,280
Save it for when you're on DougLovesMovies.

513
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,280
I'm sorry.

514
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,280
I'm sorry.

515
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:05,560
We gotta get a lot more listeners before that happens.

516
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,560
Maybe.

517
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,960
Next time he's at the Rosemont or whatever.

518
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,960
There we go.

519
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,980
Anyway, that clip was weird.

520
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,520
But I'm telling you, this next clip is much weirder.

521
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,240
I might have oversold how weird that clip is.

522
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:21,960
I think it's fucking very weird that he believes that there's Interstellar rules.

523
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,600
That's very weird to me.

524
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,360
This next clip is very – I think it's undeniably weird.

525
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,360
Okay.

526
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:33,760
And they think that people lining up to get their new iPhone, that's technology.

527
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,760
No, that's 50-year-old crap.

528
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,760
Exactly.

529
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,480
The true technologies, they have it.

530
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,800
The true technologies are mind and are genetics that every scientist that's in genetic engineering

531
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,240
understands isn't even of this world.

532
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,560
We're made in the image of the creator that made this planet.

533
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,080
We predate this planet.

534
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,180
The elite all know that.

535
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:59,600
They're just there dumbing the public down to not get it.

536
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,600
We're not seeking after the elves.

537
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,600
We are the elves.

538
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,600
And they know that.

539
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,200
They can't stand it.

540
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,520
They want to keep you from that knowledge.

541
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,060
They're aware of what we are.

542
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,280
They want to play God while we run around watching NFL.

543
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,920
That's what the joke is.

544
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,920
Yes.

545
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,040
I don't have any favorite idol.

546
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,280
My idol is myself to tell you the truth.

547
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:28,060
My idol is human ingenuity and going to the stars and fulfilling God's destiny.

548
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,060
My idol is my dear.

549
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:36,320
And that's what we need to show our children and try and reach as many people as we can.

550
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,320
I agree with you.

551
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,320
God bless you.

552
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,320
I got to jump.

553
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,840
But this is not an elite that would put stuff in vaccines to lower our IQ and put fluoride

554
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,280
in the water to lower our IQ.

555
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,240
An elite doesn't seek to dumb people down.

556
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,720
Let's say the elite are some alien species.

557
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,880
I'm not saying that, but let's just hypothetically.

558
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,840
What type of elite alien species wants to dumb down a planet and make people a bunch

559
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,840
of retarded idiots?

560
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,120
I mean, you know what?

561
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,120
You're not my God.

562
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,080
A real God wants to build me up and give me Promethean fire.

563
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,080
Not control me.

564
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,080
Do you not know that goddamn reference?

565
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,080
No, no, no.

566
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,080
You are not God.

567
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:15,680
You are fallen degenerate scum standing in the way of the true creation that dominates

568
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,680
you.

569
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,680
They hate humanity.

570
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,680
They hate honor.

571
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,680
They hate beauty.

572
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:24,360
They hate creativity because we are their God.

573
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,400
You understand that?

574
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,120
The elite cannot stand true humanity.

575
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,100
They will go to hell before they capture anything.

576
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,360
They're a joke.

577
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:39,000
They're only there to provide us with the stress to make us go to the next level.

578
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,280
Let's get that straight to your heads that they are fallen.

579
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,280
They are failed.

580
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,720
They are scum.

581
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,560
So let them play their games.

582
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,460
Let them win for the season.

583
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,040
We win for eternity.

584
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,040
Praise Jesus Christ.

585
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,960
I mean, you're getting so hardcore today, but I prayed last night at like 10 o'clock

586
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,960
at night.

587
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,440
I said, God, just let me tell the truth.

588
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,000
I am tired of backing down to these people.

589
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,100
I'm tired of watching them have their way with humanity.

590
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,600
Just turn me loose and turn humanity loose.

591
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,880
Amy in Tennessee, you're on the air.

592
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,880
Man.

593
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,880
Man oh man.

594
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,720
Amy in Tennessee, you are on the air.

595
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,040
That is smooth as silk.

596
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,040
Wow.

597
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,680
So what do you think about that?

598
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,040
Humans predate the earth.

599
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,040
Well, yeah.

600
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,920
I think most Christians believe that, right?

601
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,920
I don't think so.

602
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,680
I don't think that's nowhere near any kind of Christianity, right?

603
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:35,200
That's not anywhere near anything outside of like the weirdest theosophy, like the weirdest

604
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,800
pseudo spiritualism.

605
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:43,020
I mean, I guess there is a little bit on the seventh day God rested and then he went back

606
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:47,080
to the negative first day and he was like, well, I might as well create humans here too.

607
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,460
I mean, why not?

608
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:53,220
It goes into a little bit of like vaguely Gnostic beliefs.

609
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:58,280
There is a tiny bit of the idea of like pieces of your spirit predate humanity, that sort

610
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,280
of thing.

611
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,280
Little bit of Tolkien.

612
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,280
Sure.

613
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,280
Little bit of elves.

614
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,280
We're not...

615
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,200
And a little bit of internet message board Illuminati talk.

616
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,040
That goes back to a lot of that stuff.

617
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:14,880
And the idea that he presents that these globalists, all they're there for is to be a challenge

618
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,000
for us to get to the next level.

619
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,720
That's a fairly common belief within Christianity though, that idea that this life is a test.

620
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,360
Right, but it also goes to the ideas that have been pitched on internet message boards

621
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,080
about the Illuminati.

622
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:36,120
So with all of the bullshit that we deal with, every time he gets into that weird religious

623
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:42,080
aspect, he just has so much more of a ring of truth to him.

624
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:51,160
When he's saying we're not seeking the elves, we are the elves, it feels like he believes

625
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,160
that.

626
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,160
Right.

627
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,160
Like all of the...

628
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,160
And that's speaking in parable.

629
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,160
Yeah.

630
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,640
And that's like, if you guys understand, you get it.

631
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,640
You way get it.

632
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,640
Yeah.

633
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,760
You maybe get it too much.

634
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,120
I wonder if he's talking about the DMT machine elves.

635
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,680
You know when people take DMT, they often see machine elves.

636
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,720
I don't know what that means at all.

637
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,720
Dimethyltryptamine is a substance that you can take, it's a very powerful hallucinogen,

638
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,180
and you can smoke it.

639
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:21,480
And when you do, a lot of people...

640
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,900
I don't know what the percentages are, and I haven't taken it myself.

641
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,680
A lot of people report that you...

642
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,280
Well, we started drinking wine, so I suppose the next episode we're gonna have to do DMT.

643
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,280
I'm in.

644
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

645
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,120
It lasts for like ten minutes and we could never record on it.

646
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,840
You can't move, you're just hallucinating so hard.

647
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,080
Maybe you can move a little, who cares?

648
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:45,000
But a lot of people report that they see elves working gears and machinery.

649
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,920
And some people have speculated that behind the veil of reality, like DMT allows you to

650
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,560
see beyond the...

651
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,560
Pierce the veil.

652
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,560
Yeah, yeah.

653
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:57,920
They see that there are elves who are working the machinery of reality that create whatever

654
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,840
we see in our reality.

655
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,040
Well that's obvious, though.

656
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,200
Where else would we get cookies?

657
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,200
Those trees.

658
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,320
Those trees that have elf factories.

659
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,600
Look, let's not go any further down this road.

660
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,240
Let's try and stay on topic.

661
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,240
We're still in the sixth.

662
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,800
You've already established that we're doing an eight and a half hour long episode.

663
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,800
Never drinking wine on the show ever again.

664
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,640
This is already off the rails.

665
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,200
So on the sixth, Alex Jones does a lot of that weird stuff.

666
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:34,080
And then in addition to that, we start to see this creeping pro-Russia stance.

667
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,000
Oh, we're starting to see it now.

668
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,080
Well no, we've already seen the beginnings of it starting to develop.

669
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,080
Right, right, right.

670
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,960
No, but that was more like pro-strong man.

671
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,240
Russia is male.

672
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,240
Pro-a-man-taking-bah.

673
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,240
Yeah.

674
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,080
That whole thing.

675
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,920
We're starting to see a little bit more of it.

676
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,160
And here's what he has to say about Russia and Assad.

677
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:59,360
And then we see the shocking images of a drowned Syrian boy show tragic plight of refugees.

678
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:05,400
Our government five years ago launches Al-Qaeda in Syria, kills 300,000 of these innocent

679
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,400
people.

680
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,160
And then when Russia and Syria fight back, we call them terrorists.

681
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:14,360
And our own media says that quote, take out Assad, that'll stop ISIS when that's the group

682
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,360
attacking.

683
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,880
And they show a dead little two year old toddler in the sand, but they won't show them.

684
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,880
Fuck you.

685
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,440
Tens of thousands of dead babies that I've seen online.

686
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,440
Fuck you.

687
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,520
And you've seen online that were killed by Western backed rebels in Syria.

688
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,760
So they create the crisis and then say, look, a dead baby.

689
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,760
Yeah, look.

690
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:39,400
So that's crazy.

691
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
Compare that.

692
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:48,600
Compare that bullshit fake empathy with when somebody, like when a terrorist attack happens

693
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:54,560
and he revels in all of the people who died saying, look at how right I am.

694
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,520
And then he pretends to give a fuck about that.

695
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:06,600
Uh, no, no, he doesn't get to own both empathy and, and complete sociopathy.

696
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,600
That doesn't count.

697
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,600
Fair.

698
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,600
That's a fake voice.

699
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,600
Oh yeah.

700
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,600
That's a fake bullshit.

701
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,600
Oh yeah.

702
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,600
No, I'm not cool with that.

703
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,620
Well, are you cool with the fact that he's saying that basically Russia and Assad are

704
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,620
the good guys?

705
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,620
Well, of course.

706
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,620
Okay.

707
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:23,840
Well, actually, you know, uh, that was the sixth and then on the seventh is labor day.

708
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,760
So he doesn't have a show on labor day.

709
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,080
They just do a rerun show.

710
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,080
Uh huh.

711
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,400
Uh, and so, you know, no need to dwell on that.

712
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,760
I'm glad he supports union holidays.

713
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,960
Well, I think he actually, I'm sure that he loves the free market and prosperity so much

714
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,720
that he has to be like, well, thank God we have a day to celebrate union.

715
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,160
He does actually make a little bit of a point of that.

716
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,160
Oh really?

717
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,160
Yeah.

718
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,120
I got to celebrate this union holiday, got to give my people a day off.

719
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,240
Anyway, uh, we come back on the eighth and uh, guess what?

720
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:58,920
He's still on his bullshit about Russia being the good guys, but as you can see, I'm particularly

721
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:04,440
crazed today because this is the reality of what's happening.

722
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:09,040
And then I look at all the other news, all the other things that are happening.

723
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:13,840
U S demands Greece close airspace to Russian humanitarian aid for Syria when they're only

724
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,680
flying them in food and Russia is doing us a favor trying to keep all the refugees from

725
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,680
coming here.

726
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:25,320
See, I mean, that's not to, that's not to say that that in and of itself is an evil

727
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,320
thing to say.

728
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:32,200
It's not wrong to say that Syria does or Russia does some good things, some bad things, but

729
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:38,840
we're seeing a pattern developing over the course of early September of just outright

730
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,840
Russia's the good guys, we're the bad guys.

731
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,680
And it's really bizarre.

732
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:48,200
It's really bizarre considering Alex Jones has passed, he has, but as we've discussed,

733
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,200
he played into so much Russophobia in his early career.

734
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,240
And the last time Russia did us a favor was in world war two.

735
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,400
That's that was the very last time.

736
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,400
Yeah.

737
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,400
Yeah.

738
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,400
So I don't know.

739
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,400
I don't know what to make of it.

740
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:07,600
It is really interesting that, uh, if we look at the timeline of the world, it seems like

741
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,800
summer fall of 2005 is when something 2015.

742
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,800
Yeah.

743
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,800
Excuse me.

744
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,800
Yeah.

745
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,800
2015 is when something really fucked up happened.

746
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,800
Yeah.

747
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,560
I think that that might be the branching point when our world could have gone one way or

748
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,560
the other and we went the wrong way.

749
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,240
That's our dark timeline.

750
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:31,760
It just so happens that that's when, uh, Alex Jones is starting to warm to Trump, happens

751
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,440
to be saying tons of positive shit about Russia and Assad on his show.

752
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,440
I don't know.

753
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,680
I don't have a conclusion, but it's weird.

754
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:49,200
The thing that I think about pretty consistently is what's the balance between Putin taking

755
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,340
advantage of a situation and Putin instigating the situation, right?

756
00:33:54,340 --> 00:34:01,040
So all of these guys right now in 2015 are just starting to be like, well, look at this

757
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,680
strong man doing shit right now.

758
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:10,640
How much of that is Russian propaganda seeping out and then Putin gone or you know, if not

759
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:16,680
Putin himself directly, but his, his circle of oligarchs, um, saying this is something

760
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:24,060
we can take advantage of and how much is directly his like, look at what I did like that kind

761
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,060
of a shit.

762
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:31,880
I think as it relates to Alex, it's, he's taking in like RT and Sputnik and he's getting

763
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:36,040
the Russian line as the truth because it's more appealing to him.

764
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:40,800
He has this idea that it's a masculine culture and that they've kicked out the globalists

765
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,040
and therefore their media is obviously much more reliable than ours.

766
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,680
Ours is just full of propagandists and CIA plants that are in the media.

767
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:57,240
And so he just has no reason to doubt things that come from their, their outlets.

768
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,760
It's mind boggling to try and see through these people's eyes.

769
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,760
It's very weird.

770
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:10,320
It seems it's, it could not be more obvious that RT is a state controlled media outlet

771
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,720
even more so only shows what the state wants you to see.

772
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,720
Yeah.

773
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,680
Like it can't be more obvious.

774
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,120
So how can you not catch it?

775
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,680
I don't know.

776
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,720
The way is you don't want to, well, yeah, yeah, you're, you're absolutely right.

777
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:31,640
It doesn't fit with what you, I, I, I mean, I do understand though, because if you've

778
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:39,840
built your entire life, like if you're Alex Jones at, in 2015 he's 40 ish, maybe, maybe

779
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,840
a hundred.

780
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,840
Who knows?

781
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,840
He's timeless.

782
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,720
His soul has migrated and he's talking with his ancestors and blah, blah, blah.

783
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:52,660
So you've built your entire life around this ethos and just like you said, we have this,

784
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:59,160
we have this splitting point, dark timeline versus the light timeline, wherein either

785
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:04,760
all of these people really confront themselves and say, what I've believed for the longest

786
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:09,080
length of time is wrong or they doubled down.

787
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,080
They doubled down.

788
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,080
And of course they doubled down.

789
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,240
Well, at least in the case of Alex, certainly.

790
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:17,640
I don't, I can't speak to whatever is happening with political figures and shit like that,

791
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,440
but in terms of Alex, yeah, he's like, oh.

792
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:29,200
I would actually say that the, the entire politics of 2015 was the, the firm cementing of there

793
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,000
will never be a shared reality again.

794
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,080
Oh, totally.

795
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:37,400
Like it started, it started when Fox News started.

796
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,400
Fuck off man.

797
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,040
It started like Reagan, probably.

798
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,040
You know what?

799
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,040
You're absolutely right.

800
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,360
I don't know if it was even before that.

801
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:49,120
That was when the billionaire campaign of lobbying really took off.

802
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,120
Yeah.

803
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:55,080
But, but that I feel like is whenever it's like, this is how it's going to be forever.

804
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,080
Yeah.

805
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,800
I, I agree that it's where things ramped up to a, to a horrifying extent.

806
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,800
Yeah.

807
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,040
I think it's because, uh, people realized that, uh, election was coming up and they

808
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,440
realized that, uh, it was win or lose at that point.

809
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,440
Yeah.

810
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:14,120
And the trends in society that we could see were like, well, if something doesn't happen,

811
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,120
Democrats are never going to lose another election because that's just the way society

812
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,120
is going.

813
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,120
Yeah.

814
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,560
People are becoming more progressive.

815
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,960
People are becoming more accepting, more opening.

816
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,760
Uh, and that is what the Democratic party largely represents, especially over the Republican

817
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,760
party.

818
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:35,320
And unless a third of viable party were to exist, uh, there doesn't seem like there's

819
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,040
any shot there.

820
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:42,760
And the GOP really embraced it because they were the ones who realized that the only way

821
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,920
we win elections is to lean into being the white supremacist party.

822
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:55,680
Because if you look at that, uh, the, uh, GOP autopsy that they did on the 2012 election,

823
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,880
it was all about, we need to return back to the big tent.

824
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,220
We need to expand.

825
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:03,440
We need to, uh, find more Latino voters.

826
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,320
We need to do all of this stuff.

827
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:09,800
And they took none of that advice and didn't need to and didn't need to because they gerrymandered

828
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,800
the hell out of it.

829
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,800
Exactly.

830
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,800
And purged voter rolls, blah, blah, blah.

831
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,800
They went straight to white supremacy.

832
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,800
Yeah.

833
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,800
And, uh, God bless him.

834
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,800
I don't know.

835
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,800
I don't know.

836
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,800
No.

837
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,680
God bless him because they give us something to fight back against.

838
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,320
They are the Illuminati of how we grow.

839
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,320
That's how we grow as people.

840
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:32,200
So on the eighth, Alex Jones has a long interview that in genetic memory.

841
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,200
That's also how it grows.

842
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:38,520
How you learn, uh, Anthony Gucci already comes in for a really long interview about how great

843
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,900
their products are and about how terrible immigrants are.

844
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:45,980
There's they're trying to, they're, they're, they're hitting both at the same time.

845
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:50,480
They're trying to scare people about the immigrant waves that are going to come while simultaneously,

846
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,820
you know, being like, all our products are fucking awesome.

847
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:57,120
They're spending way more time on the show trying to sell stuff like, uh, you know, we

848
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:02,280
have these periodic visits from Dr. Group who comes in for like these hour long sessions

849
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:06,680
and now we're seeing like Anthony Gucci already is on almost every day doing something to

850
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,480
try and sell product.

851
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,880
And that is not, uh, that is not unremarkable.

852
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,920
It's part of the lead up to the money bomb.

853
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,920
Money bomb.

854
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,920
Yeah.

855
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,360
In some world we exist in, it's going to ramp up and ramp up hard.

856
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,360
Yeah.

857
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:26,000
So the, uh, after that, Alex Jones has an interview with John McAfee who created McAfee

858
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
McAfee.

859
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
The McAfee.

860
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Yes.

861
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,880
The guy who infects every windows computer with junkware.

862
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,880
Uh, that'd be him.

863
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,480
Uh, he's also the guy who may or may not have murdered his neighbor in South America.

864
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,480
Wait, what?

865
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,120
I don't know if this is the case.

866
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:45,880
His neighbor wound up dead and he fled, uh, he was living down South, uh, the border.

867
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:52,680
And, uh, his neighbor ended up dead and he was being pursued by the police for questioning.

868
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,320
I don't, I don't know if he did it.

869
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,960
I don't, I have no idea, but I do know that he fled and then his house burned down.

870
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,960
I don't know.

871
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,360
Wait, and then his house burned down?

872
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,080
As I understand the timeline, yes.

873
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:09,280
I admit I haven't done a ton of research into it, but McAfee is a wild dude.

874
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,320
He's a wild dude.

875
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,120
McAfee did that shit.

876
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,960
I'm not ready to say that.

877
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,960
That's on you, man.

878
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,960
That's on you.

879
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,840
McAfee is the O.J. of, uh, computer software.

880
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,840
And weird goatees.

881
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,840
Never seen his face.

882
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,840
Uh, he has a weird goatee.

883
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,840
Good for him.

884
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:30,020
So McAfee is on and Alex is trying to get the exclusive out of him that he's running

885
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,020
for president.

886
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,020
John McAfee.

887
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:37,300
And Alex is super excited about it because McAfee has a deep libertarian past and what

888
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,300
have you.

889
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,300
Right.

890
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,300
And anybody who-

891
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,300
Like a lot of those software giants too.

892
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,300
Sure.

893
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:46,800
All of those guys have a full-on, like, we're gonna build our own utopia out of Uber.

894
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,800
Why not?

895
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,840
If you can create a world online, why couldn't you create a world in the real world?

896
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,840
That's a good point.

897
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,660
So Alex is super excited about it because anyone who pays attention to Alex would make

898
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:58,120
a great president, obviously.

899
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:03,840
So he's trying, like, McAfee is being like, his whole storyline is, my aides, they went

900
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,200
out and they filed paperwork for me to run for president.

901
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,200
Yeah.

902
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,200
I don't know if I'm gonna run for president.

903
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,200
Yeah.

904
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,080
And Alex is like, are you giving us the exclusive?

905
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,520
Are you gonna announce here on Infowars that you're running for president?

906
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:18,160
And he's like, I can give you the exclusive that they filed some papers.

907
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,080
Like, fuck you, man.

908
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,720
That's really not a great exclusive.

909
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,800
He keeps being like, if I run, I'm gonna win.

910
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,440
Well, then why don't you run?

911
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,240
He didn't run and he didn't win.

912
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:33,520
But in the middle of their interview, Alex Jones says this, and it really troubles me.

913
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,840
That's why I like Ted Nugent is he's real and I know nothing against the NRA.

914
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,840
They used to be really bad 10 years ago.

915
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,760
Now they're really good.

916
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:47,400
We've got to radicalize the liberty movement because we face a radical globalist threat.

917
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,200
Milk toasting it won't beat it.

918
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,820
I really am scared of that mentality because all of his...

919
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,120
That's exactly what he did.

920
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,800
Because all of his stuff is based on lies and fear.

921
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,400
It's not based on reality.

922
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:04,240
So he perceives an extreme enemy that he's up against, and therefore it's okay for him

923
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:09,000
to radicalize his base, which is essentially what terrorists do.

924
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,800
Yeah, that's exactly what terrorists do.

925
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:20,600
I mean, the thing is ISIS has a better argument than he does for radicalizing their base.

926
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:26,000
With stopping short of advocating anything ISIS does, looking at it purely just on a

927
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,580
logic basis, their argument does make more sense.

928
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:34,440
They're fighting a real enemy.

929
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:39,160
Their desired goals are terrible, and those don't make sense, but the idea of fighting

930
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,600
back certainly does.

931
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,600
Oh, of course.

932
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,840
Especially in their situation.

933
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,880
And the idea of extreme measures.

934
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:52,440
Imagine if we had a terrorist group that was fighting against an imaginary enemy.

935
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,600
Without explosives, we do.

936
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,600
We do.

937
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,600
We absolutely do.

938
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,600
It's the liberty movement.

939
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,600
Yeah.

940
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,200
That was radicalized partly by Alex Jones.

941
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,200
Partly.

942
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,040
I mean, he's the most mainstream voice of the people who radicalize them.

943
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,800
Behind the scenes there are tons of those websites and shit.

944
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,860
Like there's a whole Byzantine network of monsters out there, but yeah, he does.

945
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:16,920
He's responsible for a lot of terrible shit.

946
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,720
In the end of this episode we get a phone call from Old Man House Phone.

947
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,640
He calls back in.

948
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,480
I love me some Old Man House Phone.

949
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,600
I did not pull a clip from it because it's boring, but he wants to talk to John McAfee

950
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,320
about guns.

951
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,880
That's fun.

952
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,280
It's just important to point out whenever House Phone calls in.

953
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,760
So, we move on to the tenth.

954
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,760
Hold on.

955
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,760
Let me back up real quick.

956
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,120
I'm sorry, the ninth.

957
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,440
I think I've forgotten.

958
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,800
Has Rappaport showed up?

959
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,800
No.

960
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,800
John Rappaport is not in the mix.

961
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,800
Rappaport is still not in the mix.

962
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,800
Not in the mix.

963
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,720
And I'll tell you, to the end of this, past the money bomb, still not there.

964
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,720
Still not in the mix.

965
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,720
No.

966
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,280
Let's move on, Jordan, to September ninth.

967
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:05,840
On this show, Alex Jones is very obsessed with a story out of Pittsburgh, where a gentleman,

968
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:11,440
he runs a barber shop, and he got fined $750 for refusing to cut the hair of a lady who

969
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,840
came in, because it's a dude's barber shop.

970
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,760
Alex is furious about this.

971
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,920
Like barber shop, like the movie barber shop, or barber shop like a white dude in a small

972
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,920
town?

973
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:23,920
Second one.

974
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,920
There we go.

975
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,800
I was going to say, I doubt the first one showing up on Infowars.

976
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,800
No.

977
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:34,200
He went in to the shop and they said, we are not going to get, you can't get him in here.

978
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,500
And so she was like, all right, I'm going to complain about this.

979
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,480
And he got fined $750.

980
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:43,960
Alex Jones presents it as, hey, these guys just don't have the technology to cut ladies

981
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:44,960
hair.

982
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,360
You know, like they don't know how to do it.

983
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,520
And there's a reasonable point to be made there.

984
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,480
But if you actually look into the story, you can find that this dude is basically running

985
00:44:53,480 --> 00:45:00,840
the man show out of a barber shop and his reason for not wanting to like serve a woman

986
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:05,220
who came in was less about, I don't know how to cut your hair and it was more predicated

987
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:09,160
on this is where dudes go to hang out.

988
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:14,200
He ends up calling in and they have an interview on a later show where he's like, men come

989
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:18,800
in here to have a beer and make jokes and fart and they can't do that if ladies are

990
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,800
in here.

991
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,040
I'm like, you should have gotten fined.

992
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,040
Yeah.

993
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,160
Don't call yourself a business then.

994
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,160
Call yourself a clubhouse.

995
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,160
Like, right.

996
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,160
What are you doing?

997
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,160
Yeah.

998
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,160
That mentality.

999
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,720
Put your shit up in a tree, you idiot.

1000
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,720
What is this?

1001
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,720
The little rascals?

1002
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:32,720
What's happening?

1003
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,720
Absolutely.

1004
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,920
But the reason that Alex Jones has a leg to stand on in terms of his complaints is that

1005
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:42,160
he doesn't really necessarily believe that businesses should have to serve everybody.

1006
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,160
Yeah.

1007
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,160
That's true.

1008
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:48,180
I believe that based on his libertarian beliefs, if pressed, he would say that a business could

1009
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:51,360
deny service to African Americans if they wanted to.

1010
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,080
And the free market would sort it out.

1011
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,080
Right.

1012
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,080
Exactly.

1013
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,680
Even though it has been conclusively proven for all of time that the free market would

1014
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,680
not sort it out.

1015
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,280
And the last great example of that was, of course, Chick-fil-A.

1016
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,280
Yeah.

1017
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,280
Did not work out.

1018
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,280
Yeah.

1019
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,280
Didn't do shit.

1020
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:10,880
But that is what is behind his sort of support of this barbershop and it's super whack if

1021
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,920
you actually look at the details, but who cares?

1022
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:20,160
It's more interesting to me if the guy really just doesn't know how to cut ladies' hair

1023
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,240
and that was his excuse for it.

1024
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:29,760
Like if his defense in court was like, dude, I never actually went to school.

1025
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,400
I don't know how to cut this lady's hair.

1026
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,960
I'm just going to fuck up her hair.

1027
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,960
Yeah.

1028
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,320
Then I'd be like, oh, yeah, fair.

1029
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:41,440
I mean, that's borderline reasonable.

1030
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,680
But his position is not.

1031
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,680
No.

1032
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:49,520
So something way more important- This is only where I cut hair of dicks.

1033
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,520
Yeah.

1034
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:51,520
Yeah.

1035
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,080
Something way more important happens on the September 9th show.

1036
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,080
Yeah.

1037
00:46:55,080 --> 00:47:01,160
That day, or the day before, Donald Trump came out and said some stuff about immigrants

1038
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:08,000
and Alex Jones has a very strong response to it and it might not be what you expect.

1039
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,520
We're going to go out to break with Donald Trump saying we've got to accept the immigrants.

1040
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:18,200
He tells the truth about these Arab countries and African countries won't take them, but

1041
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:21,000
he says that we've got to because we have the moral high ground.

1042
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,120
The whole world's collapsing into depression.

1043
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:26,880
We can't take billions of people, especially if they're put on welfare.

1044
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,880
This is suicide.

1045
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,440
Let's go to the clip.

1046
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,200
Well, it's a serious problem.

1047
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:36,400
We haven't seen anything like it since the Second World War and it's getting worse and

1048
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,400
worse.

1049
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:42,200
And I was actually impressed in one way, but surprised that Merkel in Germany allowed this

1050
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:45,040
to happen because they're really flowing through all over Europe.

1051
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:51,440
And if you notice, Russia is not taking and China is not taking and the Gulf States, whether

1052
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:56,280
you look at Saudi Arabia or Qatar or any of them, they're taking none.

1053
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:00,880
But some of them are and some of them are actually being very generous.

1054
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:06,200
It just really, I wonder, you know, where all the really Donald being generous with

1055
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:12,440
the Germans that pay some of the highest taxes in Europe or the French that pay 84% on average

1056
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:15,480
for people to come in and get put on welfare.

1057
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:22,540
I mean, you read the scams that third world immigrants run all across the place, Somalis

1058
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:25,880
up in Minnesota, Afghans in Germany.

1059
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:29,280
I mean, they just don't pay the taxes.

1060
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,780
They don't they do whatever they want.

1061
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:34,680
They run black market operations and they get welfare.

1062
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,520
And then, oh, I want to commend Merkel.

1063
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,520
She's so generous.

1064
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:41,160
Hey, Trump, shut your fat mouth, you punk.

1065
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:42,480
I knew you'd start flip.

1066
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,000
My gut told me something.

1067
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
How about you give your five billion dollars to him?

1068
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
OK.

1069
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,360
Holy shit.

1070
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:55,140
I'm telling you, man, he was against abortion, then he was for it, then he was against it,

1071
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,140
all the rest of it.

1072
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:57,400
He loves Hillary Clinton.

1073
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,400
Whoa.

1074
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,400
Wow.

1075
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,400
Is that intense?

1076
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,280
So this is this is bizarre.

1077
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,480
That is wild.

1078
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,480
Yeah.

1079
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:11,000
Alex Jones has taken an anti Donald Trump stance on September 9th, 2015.

1080
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,440
That's more like vitriol.

1081
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,440
That's more passion.

1082
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,440
He called him a punk.

1083
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,440
Yeah.

1084
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,440
Once you shut your fat mouth.

1085
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,440
Yeah.

1086
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,440
That's more interested.

1087
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,000
Like that's exactly what he said to Schiff.

1088
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,880
He just didn't say, fill your hand.

1089
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:24,880
Yeah.

1090
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:25,880
Goddamn cocksucker.

1091
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:26,880
Yeah.

1092
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:31,280
Well, like that is more passionate than all of the stuff he said about his mob ties.

1093
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,280
Absolutely.

1094
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,160
Like that in the past episodes we've gone over.

1095
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,480
That's super bizarre.

1096
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,480
Yeah.

1097
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,760
That I don't know what to make of that.

1098
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,080
In the moment Trump is not a white supremacist.

1099
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,080
Wow.

1100
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,080
Yeah.

1101
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,080
How?

1102
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,080
What?

1103
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,080
Mm hmm.

1104
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,080
How are we still doing?

1105
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,760
It should be over by now.

1106
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:49,760
Totally.

1107
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,760
What?

1108
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,080
There's so many goddamn twists and turns.

1109
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,080
Yeah.

1110
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:57,000
So on this show after this, he has an interview with the sheriff, the guy who's he's not the

1111
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
sheriff.

1112
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,040
Just the sheriff like a like a Cormac McCarthy character.

1113
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,320
He has an interview with the judge whose eyes are burning fire.

1114
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:08,280
He has an interview with a guy who's running for sheriff in Houston.

1115
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,280
Okay.

1116
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,440
And this guy is nuts.

1117
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:16,840
He says that he thinks that Obama is creating racial strife in order to cancel the 2016

1118
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,840
elections.

1119
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:21,220
Uh, spoiler alert, he does not win the election for sheriff.

1120
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,220
Goddamn it.

1121
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,720
If, ah, oh man.

1122
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,680
If Obama had just canceled him.

1123
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,680
Mm.

1124
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:27,680
Mm.

1125
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,680
Man.

1126
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:29,680
Good stuff.

1127
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:30,680
Yeah.

1128
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:31,680
Good stuff.

1129
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:32,680
We'd have to deal with the militia uprising, but I think that would be easier.

1130
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:35,560
We'd have to get the revolution out of the way pretty quick and then just moved on.

1131
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,560
Band-aid coming on.

1132
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,560
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1133
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:42,280
Uh, so after that, and he has an interview with Ted Nugent, the nudge calls in, he put

1134
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,840
up the nudge signal on the past day when he was talking to John McAfee.

1135
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,080
You heard that in the little clip there.

1136
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1137
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,080
He's like, I was just honest.

1138
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,080
He's real.

1139
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,400
He's like, I haven't talked to the nudge in a while.

1140
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:56,680
So he gets nudge to call in and he talks about how his show on the sportsman channel has

1141
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,960
been canceled and it's because everybody's afraid of guns.

1142
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:04,040
Everybody's got the best ratings ever, and I don't think any of that's true.

1143
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:07,760
I think it's just a convenient way for them to play victim about the Second Amendment.

1144
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,760
Yeah.

1145
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,440
And it's very boring, so.

1146
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:15,200
Like it's hard for them to find an excuse to play victim about the Second Amendment.

1147
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,200
Yeah.

1148
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:21,840
Also, I would like to wonder, what is, why was Alex saying that ten years ago the NRA

1149
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,800
was very bad and now it's very good?

1150
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,880
Oh, because they weren't that extreme about the Second Amendment.

1151
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,760
They had gone into a period where they were sort of kowtowing to anti-gun interests and

1152
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,600
they'd be like, well, maybe you don't need semi-automatics.

1153
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,420
Maybe you're right.

1154
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:36,880
Maybe that is reasonable.

1155
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:43,480
And because of these other people, these more extreme gun groups, the NRA got molded into

1156
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,680
a more extreme organization.

1157
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:49,640
And Alex believes that gun people should be on the offensive.

1158
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,640
And actually, he has an interview later on.

1159
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,800
Man, hearing that sentence does not make me feel good.

1160
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:59,000
Gun people should be on the offensive is the problem with America.

1161
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
It's pretty scary.

1162
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,800
He later has an interview with a guy who runs a, like, Citizens for Gun Rights organization

1163
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,760
that Ted Nugent was involved with, and it's a little bit scary and they make some very

1164
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:09,760
false claims.

1165
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,760
But we'll deal with that a little bit down the road.

1166
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:16,000
So on the 9th, Alex had that thing where he called Trump a punk.

1167
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Yeah.

1168
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,920
Then on the 10th, Trump backpedaled a little bit on his, man, maybe the immigrants, maybe

1169
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:23,920
we don't have to take as many.

1170
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,640
And Alex is like, wow, good, he's backpedaling.

1171
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:31,840
But he was just mad because he changed his mind about stuff.

1172
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:36,000
His pure anger was about the fact that he flip-flops on dumb positions.

1173
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,640
And he's like, I called it all along, I knew there was a reason not to trust you.

1174
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:43,080
And then whenever he changed his mind again, he's like, well, okay, now we're back on board.

1175
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,160
Yeah, he's backpedaling, that's good.

1176
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,160
It's very weird.

1177
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,160
Wow.

1178
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,160
It's super bizarre.

1179
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,160
That's bananas.

1180
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:52,860
So on this episode on the 10th, he has Mark Dice, he has a video where Mark Dice goes

1181
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:57,720
out to the streets and tries to get people to sign a petition to ban the sale of the

1182
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,000
Bible on Amazon.

1183
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
And it barns a noble.

1184
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
God damn it.

1185
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,320
Mark Dice is the worst.

1186
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,840
Yeah, but here's the thing.

1187
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:08,000
A lot of people sign it, but you can tell, again, it's a thing where they're like, fine,

1188
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,840
fuck, I'll just sign it, leave me alone.

1189
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:16,220
But then beyond that, based on free market, based on Alex Jones' sort of libertarian beliefs,

1190
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:18,760
you should be able to not sell the Bible.

1191
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:24,200
Yeah, if you can refuse service to a lady getting a haircut, you should be able to refuse

1192
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,200
selling the Bible.

1193
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:31,080
Yeah, I don't understand where the line between your belief in religious supremacism and libertarian,

1194
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:36,720
like where is the, like, what is more important to you, religious baiting or your principles,

1195
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,880
your phony ass principles?

1196
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:39,880
It's insane.

1197
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:42,800
So Mark Dice almost gets into a fight with a guy on the street.

1198
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,440
All right, now I'm in, now I'm way in.

1199
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:50,360
Some guy is, like, really mad at him because he's trying to ban the Bible, and, but again,

1200
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:54,440
it's not ban the Bible, it's just don't sell it on Amazon or at Barnes and Noble.

1201
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,440
Wait, so, so somebody got really mad at him.

1202
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,440
Yeah.

1203
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,940
Why did they leave it in the fucking clip?

1204
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:02,880
Because the guy gets really mad at him and he's like, no, no, no, hey, hey, look, I'm

1205
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,340
doing a hidden camera show.

1206
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:07,260
We're trying to point out that people are stupid for signing this, and the guy's like,

1207
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:09,000
I don't believe you, fuck off.

1208
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,920
And then Mark Dice chases him down and is like, no, man, no, no, no, you get it.

1209
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,900
Look, the camera's right over there.

1210
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:16,480
It's so desperate and sad.

1211
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,480
Wow.

1212
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,480
Yeah, it's awful.

1213
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,480
That's pathetic.

1214
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:20,480
Yeah, Mark Dice is the worst.

1215
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,480
That's really sad.

1216
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:24,080
Alex Jones tells a story about harassing a lady at the hike and bike trail because she

1217
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:28,600
had a bumper sticker he didn't approve of, which is nonsense.

1218
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,640
That's better than elves are we are elves.

1219
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,800
I'm just giving you a rundown of stuff because, like, we can't possibly cover everything.

1220
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,800
No, no.

1221
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,560
But man, that one was, that one was wild.

1222
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,960
It's like, I don't, I don't.

1223
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,440
We've already spent an hour and a half on two clips.

1224
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:45,120
I don't believe the story about harassing this lady at the hike and bike trail.

1225
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:49,000
I think it's made up, but even in his made up story, he's still a dick.

1226
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,880
What is he doing at the hike and bike trail?

1227
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,880
He's there all the time.

1228
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:52,880
What?

1229
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:53,880
He's taking his kids there all the time.

1230
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:54,880
Oh, okay.

1231
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,400
He tells stories about the hike and bike trail at least every third episode.

1232
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,000
Well, maybe he's not a terrible father.

1233
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Maybe.

1234
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Give him his kids back.

1235
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,640
When he was, he has some, he has some custody.

1236
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:09,240
When he was telling that story about the immigrants who were fishing and cooking the fish outside,

1237
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,240
that was at the hike and bike trail.

1238
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,240
That was at the hike and bike trail.

1239
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,240
Okay.

1240
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,960
He later gets an ear infection from, uh, from the hike and bike trail.

1241
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,400
Yeah, from the lake at the hike and bike trail.

1242
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,260
You miss his two days of work because of it.

1243
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:25,920
But he uses it as an opportunity to sell, uh, uh, Silver Bullet, his colloidal silver

1244
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:26,920
product.

1245
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:27,920
Oh, okay.

1246
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:28,920
Even though.

1247
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:32,640
Dude, at this point, when you say he uses it as an opportunity to sell Silver Bullet,

1248
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:36,920
I'm halfway like, does he think, does he think werewolves are real?

1249
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:37,920
He might.

1250
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:42,960
So we're, we're in the 10th, uh, and werewolves are the original chimera.

1251
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,200
Alex Jones has a lot of really bad stuff in the next couple of days.

1252
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:49,160
Uh, and here is one of those things.

1253
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:59,600
I tell you, you talk about a death wish, but see the, in the criminals that run Europe

1254
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,120
that have hijacked it can get away with this.

1255
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,960
They can get away with anything.

1256
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:11,000
So it's not just a fetish to smear garbage all over Europe.

1257
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,960
I got stacks of articles of women being pulled out of cars, rape, children being raped.

1258
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:21,920
They're like, well, that's part of the radical Islamic culture to rape your daughter says

1259
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,440
you see, they're kicking out of their countries.

1260
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:29,560
They're poorest, their most criminal, their most degenerate, their most mentally ill and

1261
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:34,880
a bunch of 18 year old, 20 year old troublemaker crooks and ISIS people that folks don't want

1262
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,960
their countries anymore.

1263
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,560
We have them posting on their Facebook.

1264
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:39,560
I'm here, I'm in Berlin.

1265
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:40,560
Look at me.

1266
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,560
I'm a jihadi.

1267
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,560
I fought.

1268
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:44,480
I caught a bunch of Christians heads off.

1269
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:49,120
Come hang out with me ladies and all the German women turn into trendy TV and stuff.

1270
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,120
I go, absolutely.

1271
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:55,000
And that's the cool thing is to get, you know, beat up by a gang banger or a, you know, have

1272
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,920
his name tattooed all over him and or the next best things to be slapped around and

1273
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,120
put in a slave pit by a radical jihadi.

1274
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:06,760
I mean, they got all these women, teenagers, all over the world getting on airplanes and

1275
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:10,760
flooding to go be in dirt shacks and raped by over a hundred men.

1276
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:14,760
Then of course they're begging for mommy and daddy after, but that doesn't happen.

1277
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:18,280
You just get taken out of the field, shot in the back of the head, but it's so liberal.

1278
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,500
Gloria Steinem loves it.

1279
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:20,500
And so is Rachel Maddow.

1280
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:25,280
Hey Rachel Maddow, why don't you go over there and hang out with your little jihadi pals

1281
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:30,500
that little CIA Anderson Cooper promoted in the last four years as the Arab spring run

1282
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,640
by the filthy White House.

1283
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,800
That's so close to a Dennis Miller.

1284
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:35,800
Like that's so close.

1285
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,560
The Arab spring is run by the White House?

1286
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,600
The Arab spring was run by the White House according to Alex, yes.

1287
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,600
Okay.

1288
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:45,040
And the CIA was behind it and Anderson Cooper has a past with the CIA.

1289
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,040
Yeah.

1290
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:50,600
And so he was not really over there overseas in his capacity as a CNN reporter.

1291
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:54,900
He was, I don't know, inciting the Arab spring, I guess.

1292
00:57:54,900 --> 00:58:00,320
There are a couple stories that have come out of people like young white girls going

1293
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:06,240
to join ISIS in the same way that there are a couple stories that have come out of young

1294
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,120
white dudes who've gone over to join.

1295
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,560
And it generally does not end up all that well.

1296
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:12,560
No.

1297
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:15,360
There are also stories of the opposite as well.

1298
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:21,000
People going to join the actual Syrian resistance and fight against the Iraqi army.

1299
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Or the Iraqi army.

1300
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1301
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,200
Or even trying to come here as refugees.

1302
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,200
Yeah.

1303
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,200
Oh, crazy.

1304
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:33,440
But yeah, what he does is he takes like, again, it's these kernels, it's these like one or

1305
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:39,120
two stories that have come out and he embellishes it to be like there's thousands of young white

1306
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:43,760
girls who just want to go get beat by a Muslim because that's cool.

1307
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,480
These trendy women just want it.

1308
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,480
It's so disgusting.

1309
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:52,720
Well, there is a Pornhub channel.

1310
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,320
I can tell you this.

1311
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,320
There's not.

1312
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,320
There is definitely not.

1313
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:59,640
I just wanted to make you snort.

1314
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,080
That's bad.

1315
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,400
Your impulse and his.

1316
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,400
Both bad.

1317
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,440
But it has nothing on this next clip.

1318
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:07,440
Oh, no.

1319
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:12,960
This is the first of two very severe historical misrepresentations that Alex makes that we'll

1320
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,660
discuss on today's show.

1321
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:16,360
And I think it's probably the worst of the two.

1322
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,640
I'll let you decide.

1323
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:20,200
Because Hitler was a project of the elites in this country.

1324
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,200
I'm already out.

1325
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,200
I'm already out.

1326
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,200
And they shut Hitler up.

1327
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,200
Hitler was not good, by the way.

1328
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:29,020
But it's beyond what they tell you.

1329
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:30,020
Hitler was bad.

1330
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:31,020
Got it.

1331
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:38,760
Roosevelt wouldn't take the Jews because the liberal Jewish groups in New York City said

1332
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:42,440
they hadn't paid a ransom to them to get out.

1333
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:46,440
And I've had Dr. Pachinik on who was a Jew who lost family in Europe when they fled to

1334
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:47,440
Cuba.

1335
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:55,380
They fled to Cuba on a boat right after he was born because New York City wouldn't take

1336
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:58,440
them because the Jews said you didn't pay up.

1337
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,400
Oh, is it Andy Smith that doesn't want to kill Jews?

1338
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,240
I guess it is, isn't it?

1339
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:07,680
If I was a real Nazi collaborator, then it would be okay if I was Arnold Schwarzenegger

1340
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,820
that wears Nazi uniforms and says he wants to be Hitler.

1341
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:12,240
That's okay.

1342
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:18,680
But if I point out that the evil corrupt people like George Soros who was involved then, the

1343
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:25,360
people above him robbed the Jews and sucked off the Jews and told them you either pay

1344
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:28,240
a ransom or you go to Israel.

1345
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,680
And then when they said, okay, we'll go to Israel, they said still you're going to pay

1346
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,320
a ransom.

1347
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:37,520
The average ransom calculates out to $1 million today.

1348
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:44,080
All the poor Jews or the middle class Jews that didn't have it, they got sent to be murdered.

1349
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:49,320
And then the very Jews that helped murder them sit around and create a Holocaust narrative

1350
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:55,040
and projected on as guilt onto the American people as the national narrative, as if we

1351
01:00:55,040 --> 01:01:00,580
were involved in it, as if the average American that fought Hitler or whose grandfathers fought

1352
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:03,020
Hitler was bad.

1353
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:08,200
So we have to let that same Jewish mafia that helped kill the Jews with Hitler engage in

1354
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:11,320
all these criminal activities or we're anti-Semitic?

1355
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:17,580
I say feel your hand, Nazi-loving scum, and go straight to hell where you came from.

1356
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:18,800
My friends, it is official.

1357
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,880
We can now say that Alex Jones is a Holocaust denier.

1358
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:22,880
Wow.

1359
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,280
Or at least a Holocaust revisionist.

1360
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,980
Un... wow.

1361
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:28,360
That's pretty wild stuff.

1362
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:29,360
Unreal.

1363
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:32,480
So if you look into it, there are a bunch, you know, like there were people who were

1364
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:36,760
able to make bribes to get themselves out of Nazi-occupied territory.

1365
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:40,000
Yeah, not to New York City Jews.

1366
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,640
You could get out of camps if you bribed people with a lot of money because, you know, they're

1367
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,440
evil but, you know, they want some money.

1368
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:47,840
Everybody's gotta get paid.

1369
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:48,840
Right.

1370
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:53,720
Alex is extrapolating that to be like, oh, it was Jewish groups who were keeping these

1371
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:58,160
poor Jews in these camps to be killed because they didn't pay up.

1372
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,160
That's amazing.

1373
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:02,160
Because that plays on anti-Semitic tropes.

1374
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,160
Yep.

1375
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:08,120
It plays on a kernel of truth in the sense that some people were able to buy their way

1376
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:10,280
out and...

1377
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:15,260
And it does play on the fact that America absolutely denied Jewish refugees.

1378
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:16,400
You know why?

1379
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:21,480
Because of the same fucking type of people who are denying Muslim refugees now.

1380
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,480
Alex.

1381
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:27,520
So that's why they're rewriting this goddamn history so they can't, so it's like, well,

1382
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:28,720
it wasn't us.

1383
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,760
We're the ones who aren't fucking bringing it.

1384
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:32,520
No, that's fucking bullshit.

1385
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:37,960
If Alex had been around in the 19 goddamn thirties, he would have screamed about how

1386
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:42,240
Jews shouldn't be allowed in there because they're Jews because they're German.

1387
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,240
They're German.

1388
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:45,120
They're secret Nazis.

1389
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,800
That fucking bullshit.

1390
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:51,440
What better way to sneak Nazis into America than for them to be Jewish?

1391
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:54,520
They play on your sympathies and then before you know it, they're here.

1392
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:58,540
They're making a little Reichs within our country.

1393
01:02:58,540 --> 01:03:06,960
Even though the very fucking antisemitic beliefs that Hitler got, he got from intellectuals

1394
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,360
here in the 1910s and 20s.

1395
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:15,120
So this whole fucking bullshit, this whole fucking bullshit about rewriting history to

1396
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,480
make your team...

1397
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:23,760
Like if you're somebody now who says all lives matter, do not, do not pretend for a second

1398
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:29,280
that during the civil rights era, you wouldn't have been like, well, I get why Martin Luther

1399
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:33,320
King Jr. is angry, but I really don't like what he's saying.

1400
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:38,280
I'm pulling on the neck of my shirt because the next clip that we're going to play...

1401
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:40,080
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1402
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,240
God damn it, Dan.

1403
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:44,960
It starts with him in the middle of a rant about all lives matter.

1404
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:45,960
No!

1405
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:49,600
God damn it!

1406
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:50,600
Fucking Christ.

1407
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:54,880
Before we get to that, I want to just tell everybody, in case you're unaware, the idea

1408
01:03:54,880 --> 01:04:00,520
of Holocaust denial is much more complicated than just someone saying it didn't happen.

1409
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:05,080
There's a lot of schools of thought within the Holocaust denial community.

1410
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:08,880
There are people who believe, like, it did happen, but there weren't gas chambers.

1411
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:11,940
Or it did happen, but they were work camps.

1412
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:13,240
They weren't death camps.

1413
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:18,100
It did happen, but the reason that people died was because of malnutrition, not because

1414
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:22,720
of a concerted effort on the Nazi's part to kill the Jews.

1415
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:29,040
Or there's another branch that's just like, hey, yeah, six million Jews died, but a bunch

1416
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:31,300
of other people died, so why do we care?

1417
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:36,920
There's all these branches, and the thing that Alex is expressing is one of the branches

1418
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:38,720
of Holocaust denial.

1419
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:43,000
This is incredibly disgusting sort of thing to hear from him.

1420
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:50,700
This is, again, this is the, and I'm still pissed about this after our last episode,

1421
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:57,580
that is exactly the same shit that people will try with the alt-right versus the alt-light.

1422
01:04:57,580 --> 01:05:01,840
If you are minimizing the Holocaust, you are denying it.

1423
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:03,880
That is full stop.

1424
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:11,080
You are not pretending to be more fucking intelligent or more researched than anybody

1425
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:12,080
else.

1426
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,080
You're denying it.

1427
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,080
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1428
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:15,080
Exactly.

1429
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:21,480
You're a fucking monster equivalent to somebody saying that it didn't happen.

1430
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:24,440
Equivalent to somebody saying that it should have happened.

1431
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:26,000
You're a fucking monster.

1432
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,240
Full stop.

1433
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:33,440
I think that you sort of hit the nail on the head earlier, and the reason that he engages

1434
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:38,280
in this sort of thing is that there is a part of him that realizes that his mentality is

1435
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:42,840
what was the problem in our country then.

1436
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:43,840
And now.

1437
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:48,280
But be that as it may, Alex Jones does have a little thought about All Lives Matter, but

1438
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:50,720
that's not the most important part of this clip.

1439
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,880
It just is where he begins.

1440
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:57,900
He's ranting about All Lives Matter and how Democrats have to apologize for saying All

1441
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:00,560
Lives Matter when all lives do matter.

1442
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:05,840
But it leads to another really weird sort of religious rant that I actually think is

1443
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:06,840
much more interesting.

1444
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:11,520
But the rapture is a fraud.

1445
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:14,040
There's the battle of Armageddon.

1446
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:15,040
Christ comes back.

1447
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:19,440
The dead in Christ are raised.

1448
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:22,840
And then those living spend a thousand years with Christ here on Earth.

1449
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:25,080
That's what the Bible says.

1450
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,440
And they've got it that there's a teleporter machine.

1451
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:28,440
What?

1452
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:29,440
Whatever.

1453
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:32,440
Let's just say God the devil isn't real.

1454
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:34,440
For the sake of argument.

1455
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:35,440
Where is that?

1456
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:39,160
Where is that revelation that there's a teleporter machine?

1457
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,300
I want to be clear.

1458
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:44,360
That's not referencing something that he talked about before this clip started.

1459
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,360
That's I don't.

1460
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:47,680
It just came out that there is a teleporter machine.

1461
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,440
I don't know what that's in reference to.

1462
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,600
No, that's that's what he's talking about with the rapture.

1463
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:52,600
Oh.

1464
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:53,600
That's what he's saying.

1465
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,960
He's saying that the rapture isn't what people think it is.

1466
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:58,740
It's a fucking teleporter machine.

1467
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:00,120
That very well may be the case.

1468
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,120
Anyway.

1469
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,120
Here we go.

1470
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:03,120
Let's get back.

1471
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:06,880
Let's just say God the devil isn't real for the sake of argument.

1472
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:09,560
I'm going to fight putting fluoride in the water.

1473
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:12,760
I'm going to fight aborting babies and selling their body parts.

1474
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:20,000
And I don't care if twiddly-dee and twiddly-dumb preachers get up there on television in front

1475
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,800
of their crowds and follow their 501c3 and give their government script.

1476
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:27,400
Steven, finish up your points, brother.

1477
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:28,400
Thanks for holding.

1478
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,400
Wait.

1479
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:30,400
There's a guy on hold?

1480
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,400
Yeah.

1481
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:34,600
I'm going to have to leave it there as a punchline just because that's great.

1482
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:39,440
What I think is really fascinating is to look at like the preachers that he does have on

1483
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:44,540
as opposed to the preachers he complains about because he's had this guy named Pastor David

1484
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:46,400
James Manning on a bunch.

1485
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,880
Are you aware of that guy?

1486
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:48,880
No.

1487
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:55,440
David Manning is one of the craziest black nationalist homophobic pastors in the world.

1488
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:59,520
He runs a place called At-La Ministry in New York.

1489
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:03,760
And the most notable thing he's done recently is a couple years back, maybe a year and a

1490
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:08,640
half ago or so, he came out and said that the gay agenda is way more pervasive than

1491
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:09,760
we think.

1492
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:16,480
And what they're doing is that they're putting semen in the lattes at Starbucks.

1493
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:17,760
That's how you get the frothy milk.

1494
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,040
That's how you get the frothy milk.

1495
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:21,880
That makes as much sense as anything else?

1496
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,360
There's semen in the lattes.

1497
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:26,200
I'm pronouncing it like that because that's how he pronounces it and it's fun.

1498
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:27,200
That's the weirdest.

1499
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,200
It's super fun.

1500
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:29,200
There's semen in the lattes.

1501
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,200
Yeah.

1502
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:34,880
Because if you go into Starbucks and you get a latte, it has semen in it.

1503
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,520
And then you get a taste for semen.

1504
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:40,240
And then everyone goes, the gays like to eat semen and they have a lot of fun.

1505
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:44,560
So you'll associate these good times that you have with lattes with semen.

1506
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:45,640
Oh man.

1507
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:46,640
It's wild.

1508
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:50,640
But Alex has him on as a guest pretty regularly.

1509
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:54,800
Not super regularly, but at least like, I've found at least ten times he's been on.

1510
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:57,780
At least like seven.

1511
01:08:57,780 --> 01:08:58,780
It's wild.

1512
01:08:58,780 --> 01:08:59,780
Alright.

1513
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:00,780
No.

1514
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:01,780
I'm moving on.

1515
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:02,780
I have no opinions on that.

1516
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:03,780
Fucking.

1517
01:09:03,780 --> 01:09:04,780
True.

1518
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:05,780
Untrue.

1519
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:06,780
I'm fine with both.

1520
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:12,440
I'd like to say just like, full disclosure, I used to manage a Starbucks and there's no

1521
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:13,440
semen in lattes.

1522
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:14,440
They get...

1523
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:17,040
I was just waiting for you to...

1524
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:20,520
Full disclosure, I drink a lot of semen, but just recreationally.

1525
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:21,520
Oh, of course.

1526
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:22,520
No sex involved.

1527
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:25,640
I just like, I gotta get my fix.

1528
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:31,200
You get market-produced milk and it's put into a steaming wand.

1529
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:35,160
You have a cup and the steaming wand froths the milk.

1530
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:36,160
This is how I...

1531
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:37,160
Yeah.

1532
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:38,160
It's not jizz.

1533
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:42,220
But that, like, he complains about churches all the time and yet he'll have someone like

1534
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:43,220
him on.

1535
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:46,520
It's fucking bizarre, but I mean...

1536
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:47,520
Everything.

1537
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:48,520
Everything.

1538
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:49,520
Nothing makes sense.

1539
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,520
Everything is bizarre right now.

1540
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,160
So like I told you, they're doing a lot of sales.

1541
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,160
They're trying to boost sales.

1542
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:54,880
Trying to get the shit out.

1543
01:09:54,880 --> 01:10:00,480
And it's like every single day, there's something like this big Anthony Gucciardi appearance,

1544
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,000
Dr. Group coming on.

1545
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,480
On the 10th, they have an even bigger thing happens.

1546
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:10,040
We're gonna go to our guest, Steve Wetzel, here in just a moment who I asked to come

1547
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,980
on the show.

1548
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:14,600
I've been in talks with these folks.

1549
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:18,480
We're gonna spend about 10 minutes on this and then get back into the news.

1550
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:24,520
I've been in talks, well, they've been a sponsor for four years, three, four years, but I've

1551
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:29,480
been in talks for two years to do this.

1552
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:31,960
And finally, we got it all done.

1553
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:36,040
I'll be honest with you, I went out and talked to some of the other top providers and they

1554
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:42,120
just couldn't provide something as good, as as low a cost that was as high quality.

1555
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,920
Because I believe in treating people like I want to be treated.

1556
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:45,920
The golden rule...

1557
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:46,920
This is fucking boring.

1558
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:49,000
He launches a line of survival foods.

1559
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:54,760
He has a group called My Patriot Supply and their private labeling.

1560
01:10:54,760 --> 01:11:00,960
Like an entire line of, you know, you get buckets in your house of food.

1561
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:08,600
So I mean, he's just really trying to expand what he has for people to buy.

1562
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:11,080
So I mean, it does feed into this, we need to make money.

1563
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:13,240
We need to make money fucking fast.

1564
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:16,300
So you get a little bit of a markup on this new thing.

1565
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:19,400
It's a good new revenue stream, especially when you're fucking spending all your time

1566
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,720
scaring people.

1567
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:22,580
So there's that.

1568
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:30,400
Also on this show, super fun to note, Alex Jones legit forgets what year 9-11 happened.

1569
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:34,140
Oh, God.

1570
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:35,140
It's 2015.

1571
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:36,140
Oh, fantastic.

1572
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:37,140
It's 2015.

1573
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:40,700
He says it's the 15th anniversary coming up of 9-11.

1574
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:42,360
And then he's like, hold on.

1575
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:43,360
Is that right?

1576
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:44,360
15th anniversary.

1577
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:45,960
He even thinks about it.

1578
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:46,960
He's like, that's it.

1579
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:47,960
That's it.

1580
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:48,960
Hold up.

1581
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:49,960
Nah, it's 15th.

1582
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,400
It's always just fun to remember when people forget 9-11.

1583
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,480
Anyway, let's get on to 9-11.

1584
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,720
September 11th, 2015 is the next day.

1585
01:11:56,720 --> 01:12:01,040
Oh, that's right, we're actually doing a 9-11 episode.

1586
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:02,040
Forget about that.

1587
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:04,280
He doesn't talk about it almost at all.

1588
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:08,920
The 9-11 episode in 2015 is very, like, it's kind of blasé.

1589
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:09,920
Hey, let's be honest.

1590
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:10,920
It's kind of bland.

1591
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:13,400
Aren't we all a little bit done with 9-11?

1592
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,520
I've moved on.

1593
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,560
So here is something that he does have to say on 9-11.

1594
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:23,760
At a certain point, you know, seeing 2,000 people die versus the half a million civilians

1595
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:29,680
that we killed in Iraq, kind of like, you know what?

1596
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:30,680
It evens out.

1597
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:31,680
Sure.

1598
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:33,280
I think I'm good on 9-11.

1599
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:35,160
I don't think we're the good guy anymore.

1600
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:36,160
No.

1601
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:37,160
No, no, no, no.

1602
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:38,160
No.

1603
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:40,900
Oh, on 9-11, that was the day that he has the interview with the guy with the barbershop

1604
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:41,900
that we talked about earlier.

1605
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:42,900
Yes.

1606
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:46,600
He's having this interview and the guy is a sleazy seaman dude.

1607
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:49,160
He just gave me a very bad vibe.

1608
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:50,880
These dudes can't fart if ladies are around.

1609
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:51,880
I like them to fart.

1610
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:52,880
Wait, what?

1611
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:54,360
That's sort of one of his arguments.

1612
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:55,680
I have my man cave here.

1613
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:58,360
Dudes can't tell jokes and fart if women are around.

1614
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:01,880
That is legitimately, like, what his argument comes down to.

1615
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:02,880
All right.

1616
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:08,640
But more importantly, Alex has something he needs you to be really afraid about on 9-11,

1617
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:09,720
and here's that.

1618
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:18,080
They are going to turn the Middle East over to radical Islam, merge with communism.

1619
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:19,280
That's not how that works at all.

1620
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:24,080
That's the checkmate move by the New World Order and the central banks and Saudi Arabia.

1621
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,800
Do you understand that?

1622
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:30,880
Do you have that through your head, okay?

1623
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:34,720
And then if the states don't go along with it here in the United States, the globalists

1624
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:38,560
are going to bomb stuff and say the patriots did it, or they're going to find reasons to

1625
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:42,320
indict people, like the Texas Attorney General, I know they're trying to indict the governor

1626
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:46,080
right now, and I'm not going to get any more of that.

1627
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,080
I mean, do you understand?

1628
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:52,280
They got feds following the governor around all the time.

1629
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:54,040
Don't they always have feds following the governor?

1630
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:57,360
Yeah, but the governor was in trouble for some insider trading stuff.

1631
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1632
01:13:58,360 --> 01:13:59,360
Illegal things.

1633
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:00,360
Yeah, yeah.

1634
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:01,520
Things that were illegal that he was doing.

1635
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:02,520
Yeah.

1636
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:03,520
Alex doesn't seem...

1637
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:04,520
He seems to think he's being targeted.

1638
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:05,520
Well, if he...

1639
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:06,520
See, that's the one thing.

1640
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:10,760
If Alex lived in Illinois, he'd be like, well, of course they're following around.

1641
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:13,000
One of our governors has probably committed so many crimes.

1642
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
So many crimes.

1643
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1644
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:18,520
Even our best governors have committed at least most crimes.

1645
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,320
Light crimes.

1646
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:23,420
But those things are things you need to be afraid of.

1647
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:27,260
The idea that they're going to do false flags, blaming the patriots, the fact that they're

1648
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:30,120
going to overthrow the Middle East and merge it with communism.

1649
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:34,760
Preemptively protecting any white nationalist crime that occurs.

1650
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:39,600
A lot of that is stuff you need to be afraid of, but Alex Jones has some more information

1651
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,360
that you should be more afraid of immediately.

1652
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:42,360
What's that?

1653
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:47,080
All the time right now trying to find him with a crooked toenail to throw him in jail.

1654
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:49,600
And by the way, the FBI doesn't like doing it.

1655
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,640
I mean, most people in the FBI are not really bad.

1656
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:57,000
They're compartmentalized, but it's so dirty now, they're just going, I cannot believe

1657
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000
we're this evil.

1658
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,640
And I'm not going to get into my sources, folks, but I mean, I have sources...

1659
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:02,640
Donald Trump Jr.

1660
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:03,640
Not yet.

1661
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:10,080
That's the problem with my job, man, is I know so much more than I can even say because

1662
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,400
I can't reveal sources.

1663
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:16,500
But the reason I know they're making their move is it's bad.

1664
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:17,500
It's bad.

1665
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:19,900
They're looking at a whole bunch of governors they're going to arrest.

1666
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:24,480
They're looking at taking out people in legislatures, governments even looking at sending hit teams

1667
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:27,400
around to kill key people that aren't going to go along with this.

1668
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:30,640
And all these generals that are now telling the truth and stuff, you know they're going

1669
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,900
to send a hit team to kill you and your family, right?

1670
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:36,360
People say you suicided your wife and kids, so I'm going to tell the generals and everybody

1671
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:37,800
else something right now.

1672
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:43,720
You're going to preside over the destruction of America and the world sliding into a new

1673
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:51,720
dark age and you are going to end up getting locked in prison or killed probably because

1674
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:53,600
of your inaction and your cowards.

1675
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,640
I mean, I'm going to say it right now.

1676
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:56,640
Spoiler alert.

1677
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:57,640
None of that happened.

1678
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:02,080
That's a really, really great way to describe the GOP under Trump right now.

1679
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:03,360
How do you mean?

1680
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:04,360
Cowards?

1681
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:09,280
Like you guys, because of your inaction, are going to wind up in jail and you're like,

1682
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:11,520
oh yeah, that's probably true.

1683
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:12,520
So hit team...

1684
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:14,800
Fucking sooner or later.

1685
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:22,360
And let's be honest, now it's entirely possible that we don't make it through this whole section

1686
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:23,520
of democracy.

1687
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,520
Very possible.

1688
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:27,400
Now historically though, America's made it through shit.

1689
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:28,400
We've done it.

1690
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:29,400
We've done a lot.

1691
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:30,400
Yeah, that's true.

1692
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:35,520
And as much as they want to believe that once they enact the GOP agenda and they restrict

1693
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:39,720
voting rights and all of that shit, it's not like our voting rights haven't been restricted

1694
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:40,720
before.

1695
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:45,920
It's not like a large, it's not like women got the vote in 1776, you know, like that

1696
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:46,920
kind of thing.

1697
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:52,880
So if they do, if they, if they don't pull it off perfectly, sooner or later we're going

1698
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,560
to fucking come after them, right?

1699
01:16:55,560 --> 01:17:03,720
So if, if the GOP doesn't win this a hundred percent, and it seems unlikely sooner or later,

1700
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:06,320
they're going to get fucked and they don't understand that.

1701
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:08,680
No, but we're not saying there's going to be hit teams.

1702
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:14,440
Uh, I mean, fucking are we, are we not, are we not saying that now you're now, are we

1703
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:16,280
not saying that now you're turning into Alex Jones.

1704
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:17,280
Are we not saying that?

1705
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:21,040
I'm just saying, are we not saying you got to stop Jonesing?

1706
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:22,040
That's our new thing.

1707
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:23,040
That's our new thing.

1708
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,640
So to get too close to Alex Jones, stop Jonesing bro.

1709
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:29,120
We're no longer, we're no longer doing the points we're doing stop Jonesing.

1710
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:30,120
Yeah.

1711
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:31,320
Um, so that, that's wild.

1712
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:32,320
That didn't happen.

1713
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:36,240
Hit teams did not take out governors or legislators.

1714
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:42,200
What kind of lunacy would occur if you, I'd like to point out for all of you listening

1715
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:45,760
who think that we're a little bit off, it's not the wine, Jordan is watching the baseball

1716
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:46,760
game on his phone.

1717
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:48,760
I am not doing that.

1718
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:49,760
Jordan has the Cubs game.

1719
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:53,000
I am just, I'm just keeping, I'm just being aware of it.

1720
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,880
I am just keeping awareness of it.

1721
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,760
I understand you're a fan.

1722
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:02,360
I, I'm far more, I'm far more angry about that.

1723
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:05,240
I seen you, if you had just said it was the wine.

1724
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:06,240
Are you sure?

1725
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:07,240
Are you sure?

1726
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:08,240
It's not because, Oh wait, we're up.

1727
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:09,240
Nevermind.

1728
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:12,640
Listen, listen.

1729
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:16,200
So on September 11th, that was one of the things he wanted to talk about, but again,

1730
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:17,200
it makes total sense.

1731
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:18,360
He wants to scare people.

1732
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:21,520
And so the idea that he has high level sources that say they're going to take out all the

1733
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,520
guys you like.

1734
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:23,520
Right.

1735
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:27,200
All of our Patriot guys, they're going to take them out secretly, um, that, that feeds

1736
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:28,200
into that.

1737
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:32,040
But he also has an interview with a guy named Joseph Farah.

1738
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:33,360
You're aware of Joseph Farah.

1739
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:34,560
I am not.

1740
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:35,560
Never heard of that name before.

1741
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:40,240
He is the guy who started World Net Daily and he is a dick.

1742
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:41,240
Yeah.

1743
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:46,520
I was going to say you, you said World Net Daily and I'm like, I bet he's a horrifying

1744
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:47,520
fucking person.

1745
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:52,120
He is big into the Clinton conspiracies along with our friend Larry Nichols.

1746
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:53,120
Yep.

1747
01:18:53,120 --> 01:19:00,240
Uh, and then also he, uh, is super, has made a lot of public claims that Obama, his birth

1748
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:01,240
certificate is fake.

1749
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:02,240
Yeah.

1750
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:07,160
He offered to pay up $15,000 if they could prove it was real and then reneged once the

1751
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,800
birth certificate was revealed.

1752
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:09,800
Yeah.

1753
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:16,520
Uh, it, it, he's a, he's a dick, but he, uh, he released some information about the Clintons

1754
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:22,480
that is dubious, uh, in the past about how they wanted to silence conservative voices

1755
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:23,480
and stuff like that.

1756
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:24,480
Yeah.

1757
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:29,000
So Alex has him on to do an interview about, you know, the growing Clinton menace in the

1758
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
2016 election.

1759
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,920
And he asks Joseph Farah, uh, Hey, you've got a bunch of information.

1760
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:37,040
Why don't you release it?

1761
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:41,520
Well, you know, you have a bunch of stuff from this Clinton stash that you have very

1762
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:42,920
legitimate question.

1763
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:45,600
Now, let's see how legitimate his answer is.

1764
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:46,600
Okay.

1765
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:47,600
I agree with you.

1766
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:51,840
In closing, I want to get you back in the next few months to get into those documents

1767
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:52,840
you got.

1768
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:55,680
You said some of it was so incendiary, you had to carefully dole it out.

1769
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:58,560
When are we going to learn more about what you got from the Clinton library?

1770
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,720
I mean, what you released was bombshell.

1771
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:05,000
Yeah, well, it's, there's a lot of good stuff in there, but you know, when I look at it,

1772
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:10,920
I think this means something to me because I experienced it, you know, how much can I

1773
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:15,400
put out there without people thinking I'm just being self-indulgent and just being this

1774
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:16,520
doesn't matter.

1775
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:22,360
This is how they plan to shut down new media and how they, I mean, it's, it's really powerful.

1776
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:27,280
They thought of shutting down new media even before we got started, Alex, that's that they

1777
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:29,480
saw the, I have to hand it to them.

1778
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:34,480
They saw what a threat, uh, you know, we were at such an early stage in the development

1779
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:35,480
of new media.

1780
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:42,880
And so now, you know, now with guys like you and Breitbart and Drudge and the rest, uh,

1781
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:46,080
they really got their hands full and there'll be more serious than ever.

1782
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:49,080
Oh, that's a good dodge to Alex Jones's question.

1783
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:55,120
But in terms of the actual answer he gives us, I have a bunch of damning documents that

1784
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:59,280
I don't want to release because people think I'm just being sentimental or nostalgic.

1785
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:04,200
What is, no, that means self-indulgent, which I don't know what he also said, nostalgic.

1786
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:05,200
Okay.

1787
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:08,040
As Alex was talking over him, he said, I don't want to look like I'm nostalgic.

1788
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:09,960
I don't understand what that means at all.

1789
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:14,720
I think if I was going to try and give him a tiny bit of credit, I would say that what

1790
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:19,040
he means is people will think I'm trying to self-aggrandize, I'm trying to make myself

1791
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,440
the story about the Clintons.

1792
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:22,820
And I want to avoid that.

1793
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:27,140
It's him trying to be magnanimous and humble, but the reality is he has nothing.

1794
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:28,760
He has no information.

1795
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:34,040
Obviously, you're the fucking guy who runs and started World News, World Net Daily.

1796
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:36,860
You're on Alex Jones's show talking shit about the Clintons.

1797
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:40,800
If you had any concrete information, you would pony that motherfucking shit up.

1798
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:45,440
Frankly, even if you had no concrete information, you would make something up.

1799
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:46,440
Right.

1800
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:47,440
Why is he pretending?

1801
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:48,760
Because you want to have the MacGuffin.

1802
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:54,660
You want to have this idea of this possible thing, this magic thing that's in a box.

1803
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:56,720
It's the same thing with what's on the server.

1804
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:58,320
It's the same thing.

1805
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:03,580
Whatever it creates in your mind is way more potent than what the reality is.

1806
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:08,760
It's the same reason, like, I've been putting out these, I made an archive of the episodes

1807
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:11,800
of That's What They Want You To Think, me and Marty's conspiracy theory show.

1808
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:12,800
Yeah.

1809
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:13,800
Nice plug.

1810
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:14,800
Thanks.

1811
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,520
We did one episode about a group called the Hellfire Club.

1812
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:18,160
I don't know if you're aware of them.

1813
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:19,160
Not at all.

1814
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:21,400
They're a secret society that existed way in the past.

1815
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:25,200
There's a guy named Sir Francis Dashwood, and I just love their names.

1816
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:26,200
They're great.

1817
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:27,200
Oh, no, no, no.

1818
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:29,120
Of course I know who the Hellfire Club is.

1819
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1820
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:33,280
So they had this secret society, and most of it really was just debauchery.

1821
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:34,280
It was fucking.

1822
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:38,400
It was drinking and fucking and saying things that God doesn't want you to say, and making

1823
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:41,040
paintings of themselves as saints.

1824
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,600
Sodomy was involved.

1825
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:44,540
Yeah, probably a lot of butt-fucking.

1826
01:22:44,540 --> 01:22:50,760
But the idea that they had was they created secrecy intentionally.

1827
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:57,440
They had this methodology wherein they would publicly talk about how secret their society

1828
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:58,440
was.

1829
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:01,400
And because they would do that, there was a mystique to what they did.

1830
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:05,100
And everyone thought they were doing way more important shit than they were actually doing.

1831
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:06,600
They were drinking and fucking.

1832
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:11,200
They were committing sacrilege, perhaps, but it wasn't to any larger goal.

1833
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:16,440
But because they would be like, ask me about the Hellfire Club.

1834
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:19,160
Hey, Dan, have you been to the Hellfire Club?

1835
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:22,840
Man, I haven't, but I hear they're really up to some weird shit in there, but no one

1836
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:24,320
talks about what goes on there.

1837
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:25,320
Nobody talks about it?

1838
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:26,320
No.

1839
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,000
But, like, do you know?

1840
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,000
I have no idea.

1841
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,440
I've heard some fables.

1842
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:32,440
Fables?

1843
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:33,440
Fables?

1844
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:34,440
Yeah.

1845
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:35,440
Did Aesop write about the Hellfire Club?

1846
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:36,440
Moving on.

1847
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:37,840
That roleplay didn't work out.

1848
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,400
But you understand what I'm saying?

1849
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:41,360
None of our roleplays have ever worked out.

1850
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:42,360
We've never taken improv classes.

1851
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:43,360
No.

1852
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:44,360
But you understand what I'm saying?

1853
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:45,360
No, absolutely.

1854
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:46,360
Joseph Farah's playing the same game.

1855
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:51,320
This mystique, like, I don't want to release this stuff because your mind will be like,

1856
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:53,080
oh, it's got to be the most damning stuff.

1857
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:54,080
He's not putting it up.

1858
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:55,080
Maybe it's dangerous.

1859
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:56,080
Yeah.

1860
01:23:56,080 --> 01:24:01,360
I think what had the best representation of that, I think, is in one of his, I think it

1861
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:07,680
was the long, dark tea time of the soul, he had a famous author who would famously have

1862
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:13,120
a bunch of chickens taken into his hotel room every night and nobody knows what they were

1863
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:14,120
for.

1864
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:15,120
Yeah.

1865
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:18,000
And then later on he was like, well, yeah, he just had them brought in and had them smuggled

1866
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:22,800
out with nobody knowing because it created that sense of, what the fuck is this guy doing?

1867
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:23,800
Like that kind of thing.

1868
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:26,240
How many weird celebrities play that same game today?

1869
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:27,240
Yeah, exactly.

1870
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:28,240
Yeah, absolutely.

1871
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:32,320
So Joseph Farah is playing the same game, but it's unfortunately way more damaging because

1872
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:36,480
what it creates is part of that vast right wing conspiracy.

1873
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:37,480
Of course.

1874
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:40,600
That Hillary Clinton so accurately complained about.

1875
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:41,600
So.

1876
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,600
Oh, poor Hillary.

1877
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:44,600
Oh, poor Hillary.

1878
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:46,440
Poor, well, actually poor all of us.

1879
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:47,440
Yeah.

1880
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:51,200
And let's be clear, we're not like sitting here saying that she's the greatest.

1881
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:52,200
No.

1882
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:53,200
That's not our game.

1883
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:54,200
Yeah.

1884
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:55,200
That's like us.

1885
01:24:55,200 --> 01:25:01,960
Like, I, the thing I think about whenever we talk about the election is a lot of what's

1886
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:06,040
going on with Emmanuel Macron right now in France.

1887
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:10,120
Like he's way better than, uh, once or fuck.

1888
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:11,120
Le Pen.

1889
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:12,120
Yeah.

1890
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:13,120
Then Le Pen.

1891
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:14,120
Right.

1892
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:15,120
But he's still acting like he's a king, you know?

1893
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,120
Yeah.

1894
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:17,120
Like he's not, he's not doing good.

1895
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:20,360
He, he sucks in a lot of ways, but Le Pen would have been so much worse.

1896
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:21,360
Yeah, exactly.

1897
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:30,120
And like our, our, our, it seems like our world now exists in the extreme far right.

1898
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:31,120
Yeah.

1899
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:32,680
And then people who are center right.

1900
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:33,680
Neoliberalism.

1901
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:34,680
Yeah, exactly.

1902
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:35,680
Yeah.

1903
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:36,680
Which is.

1904
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:37,680
Which sucks.

1905
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:38,680
Like, hey, how about progressives?

1906
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:41,680
Like I, I, this is a thing that I thought about.

1907
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:47,680
But dude, if you think about it, that is the way that a lot of conservatives felt before

1908
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:53,560
the tea party really got going is that like the center was liberal and then the extra,

1909
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:54,560
you know what I'm saying?

1910
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:59,720
Like the Republicans were coming to the center and then the Democrats were straight up socialists.

1911
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:00,720
Yeah.

1912
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:06,480
And so they launched this hard right thing and they have moved it super far to the right.

1913
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:07,480
So far right.

1914
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:12,200
And maybe, I don't know, I don't know how I feel entirely about the blossoming internet

1915
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:15,120
socialism that's been going on lately.

1916
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:20,220
I need to look into it a little more before I, before I speak on it, but it's possible

1917
01:26:20,220 --> 01:26:26,400
that that will become its own sort of a new version on the left of the tea party and swing

1918
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,060
things back.

1919
01:26:28,060 --> 01:26:32,320
But unfortunately what will happen then is it won't readjust to the middle.

1920
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:35,760
It will swing the other way and then there'll be an even more extreme response from the

1921
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:38,680
militias on the right and then eventually we'll all kill each other.

1922
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:42,720
There is, there is the, for every action there is an equal and opposite.

1923
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:43,720
Yeah.

1924
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:44,720
Yeah.

1925
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:45,720
Yeah.

1926
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:46,720
Which kind of sucks.

1927
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:49,360
Dead silence for the next 10 minutes.

1928
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:51,680
Let's get introspective.

1929
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:57,340
So speaking of things that suck, this next clip from Alex is one of the most woefully

1930
01:26:57,340 --> 01:27:00,080
misogynistic things he's ever had to say.

1931
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:01,080
And that's saying a lot.

1932
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:02,080
Oh God.

1933
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:04,040
But I just illustrate how serious this is.

1934
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:08,400
You know, I mentioned this article, feminists claim it's sexist to complain.

1935
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:13,280
See, I think it's sexist for her to complain out of 40 and slip.

1936
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:18,080
Biologists claim it's sexist to compliment women, feminazi to use the Rush Limbaugh term

1937
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:19,080
publicly.

1938
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:22,600
Uh, just real quick, let's, let's tell the story about what happened.

1939
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:28,040
What there was a lady, there was a lady who on LinkedIn, uh, had a guy sent her a message,

1940
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:32,360
uh, that was basically like, Hey, I'd like to get in touch with you.

1941
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:37,360
Also, I got to say this might not be politically correct, but you've got the best picture on

1942
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:38,360
LinkedIn.

1943
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:39,360
All right.

1944
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:42,840
And so her response was, I come here, this is a professional networking site.

1945
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:47,760
I do not want to be judged by my appearance, especially by someone twice my age, this whole

1946
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:48,760
sort of thing.

1947
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:51,640
And then there was a massive backlash against her.

1948
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:53,160
Everyone started calling her a cunt.

1949
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:57,580
Uh, she started getting tons of death and rape threats over social media.

1950
01:27:57,580 --> 01:28:02,640
She was inundated with so much abuse just from standing up for herself.

1951
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:07,200
I don't think that I read the messages that were sent, uh, they're posted.

1952
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:09,160
You can read, there's a Guardian article about it.

1953
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:12,880
I don't think that she said anything that was like, Hey, fuck you, man.

1954
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:13,880
Right.

1955
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:14,880
It was more corrective than anything else.

1956
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:17,880
It's like, Hey, don't fucking, I'm a, I'm a person.

1957
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:20,600
This is not a place for you to try and pick me up.

1958
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:27,240
I've, I've had that so many times at shows where, um, afterwards if it's me and a, uh,

1959
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:29,640
well actually this just happened recently.

1960
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:33,720
Uh, Kristen Lundberg, uh, uh, comic in Chicago.

1961
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:38,400
Um, she and I did a show together and one of the guys on the show afterwards came up

1962
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:44,000
to her and was like, man, whenever you pulled out that violin, you were so sexy.

1963
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,520
There are compliments about comedy.

1964
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:47,520
Yeah.

1965
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:49,200
You don't need, what is that?

1966
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:50,640
It's what the fuck is that?

1967
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:51,640
It's very weird.

1968
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:58,360
And the reason that like she, you were very funny instead of fucking like, that's exactly

1969
01:28:58,360 --> 01:28:59,360
what that is.

1970
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:01,640
Like, are you good at your job?

1971
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:04,680
But the reason that she brought it up and I think, you know, the conversation that's

1972
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:10,360
been had that a lot of dudes aren't listening to is that these sexualizing and eroticizing

1973
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:16,480
compliments, especially in non romantic contexts, what it does is it's a way of exerting power

1974
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:17,480
over women.

1975
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:18,480
Yeah.

1976
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:21,000
It's a way of taking away their, uh, agency and their ability.

1977
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,620
And that's the point that she was making and she's totally right.

1978
01:29:23,620 --> 01:29:25,400
Now let's hear Alex discuss it.

1979
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:26,400
Oh no.

1980
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:27,400
Shame's man.

1981
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:28,400
I don't want to know.

1982
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:29,560
For complimenting her.

1983
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:31,560
I don't want to know.

1984
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:32,560
Stop.

1985
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:33,560
Mic down.

1986
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:38,400
And now in the London Telegraph today, lawyer who accused barrister of sexism, the same

1987
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:41,680
woman has described men online as hot stuff.

1988
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:43,800
Ooh, a thought crime there.

1989
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:47,840
I mean, a mammal will be attracted to the opposite sex.

1990
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:50,040
That's not a crime.

1991
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:53,320
Having the name he or she or boy or girl, it's not bad to be he or she.

1992
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:57,520
See, I mean, this is how freakish this is getting.

1993
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:02,600
A lawyer who accused a fellow barrister of sexism in England after he described LinkedIn

1994
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:07,280
profile as stunning and previously praised men for their physical appearance online telling

1995
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:13,000
them they are hot stuff that she just chose to do this and the feminist groups said, good

1996
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:18,520
name him and shaming to get her stars in bars.

1997
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:22,920
Charlotte proud man, 27 said she felt objectified.

1998
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:28,280
Oh, oh, that's why you had your hair all done up and stuff on there after receiving an online

1999
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:33,000
message from Alexander Carter, 57.

2000
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:40,160
She had invited to connect on the professional networking site, so she invited him to connect.

2001
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:41,800
He said, wow, I love your photo.

2002
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:43,200
It's stunning.

2003
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:44,200
How dare him?

2004
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:49,800
I mean, I'll be sitting there and there's an old lady checking me out of the Dillard's

2005
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:53,280
or something about a shirt and she's got a cool watch or something.

2006
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:54,600
I don't say it if I don't like it.

2007
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:57,480
I know that's a really nice watch or your hair really looks nice.

2008
01:30:57,480 --> 01:31:04,360
I mean, does my dad does, uh, I see a guy get, you know, uh, on an elevator with me

2009
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:08,720
with a cool sports jacket or a cool Rolex or cool, uh, bag.

2010
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:09,840
I'll say, man, that's really cool.

2011
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:10,960
I'm just being nice.

2012
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:13,440
Plus I like it.

2013
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:19,800
This is sick telling us that our very communication's bad, but it is a smaller and smaller boxes,

2014
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:21,720
but it's all selectively enforced.

2015
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:26,360
If you want to have liberal Hollywood, sexism, sex stuff, debauchery, torture, murder, and

2016
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:29,200
it's okay.

2017
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:32,240
You can have kids play violent video games all day, but if they go to school and write

2018
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:38,640
an essay about the Marines and mention him to 16 here come the police.

2019
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:43,640
He wrote, I appreciate this, that this is probably horrendously politically incorrect,

2020
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:45,200
but that is a stunning picture.

2021
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:51,240
Oh, he even admitted it was politically incorrect, even prostrated himself before that.

2022
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:52,680
I'm so sorry.

2023
01:31:52,680 --> 01:32:00,320
It's politically correct, incorrect, and that's signaled her like a bug-eyed Burana to come

2024
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:06,840
in and go after him to see they pack members of the cult even more.

2025
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:14,280
I'll be, you know, what I found is these women that are fake feminist, I've talked a lot

2026
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:19,640
of guys about this, like democratic party, operative women and stuff actually want to

2027
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:24,920
be debased and want to be called pigs and stuff, and so the problem was he groveled

2028
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:25,920
to her.

2029
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:26,920
I'm not staying with her, but that's what I would imagine.

2030
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:27,920
He just said, hey, you pussy.

2031
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:33,080
It's time for us to get together right now, he's been partying that night, brother.

2032
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:35,160
Holy shit.

2033
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:36,560
Holy shit.

2034
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:38,780
That end is crazy.

2035
01:32:38,780 --> 01:32:45,240
If he had just fucking outright sexually harassed her as opposed to couched his sexual harassment

2036
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:50,380
in polite language, he would have been fucking on LinkedIn.

2037
01:32:50,380 --> 01:32:52,720
That's so fucking awful.

2038
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:54,480
That interpretation is wild.

2039
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:57,680
I don't, how can you not understand that?

2040
01:32:57,680 --> 01:33:03,320
How can you not understand that the context of his, look, I want to fuck.

2041
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:05,960
But that's not why I would hire someone.

2042
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:07,560
That's not why I would be on LinkedIn.

2043
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:08,560
Yeah.

2044
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:13,620
What's wrong with you if you're like, hey, look at this sexy attractive woman.

2045
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:18,520
That's great, so long as you're not being a creep, so long as you're not pulling them

2046
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:23,120
off the street, so long as you're catcalling, so long as it's within the context that makes

2047
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:28,160
sense and is accepted by both sides.

2048
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:34,720
But the idea that you should do that in a professional circumstance is so, it's bizarre.

2049
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:39,960
So, also, but the reason that he thinks he's in sort of safe harbor to critique her and

2050
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:45,920
call her like a wild, out of control, feminazi, blah, blah, blah, is that he said at the beginning

2051
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:49,200
of that that she'd called men sexy and hot stuff online.

2052
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:54,200
Yeah, like that's exactly fucking, fucking, fuck, come on.

2053
01:33:54,200 --> 01:34:00,760
If you look into that, the circumstances are she commented sexy on her friend's photos

2054
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:01,760
on Facebook.

2055
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:02,760
No fucking.

2056
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:04,480
Which is completely different.

2057
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:05,480
Very, very different.

2058
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:06,480
It's so stupid.

2059
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:07,480
That's congratulatory.

2060
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:12,160
He knows, he knows that people aren't going to look into it.

2061
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:18,400
He knows that his audience is already predisposed to these anti-feminist, chauvinist mentalities

2062
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:21,320
because he knows that his fucking audience is all dudes.

2063
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:27,240
But that's like, that's just like whenever they show the, or the little headlines, stuff

2064
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:37,600
like that, where it's like, oh, a former convict murdered by the cops instead of father of

2065
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:38,600
two.

2066
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:39,600
No, it's even worse.

2067
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:42,120
But when it's a white person, it's father of three.

2068
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:46,720
There were two examples within the last week that were really illustrative of that.

2069
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:47,720
Oh yeah.

2070
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:52,480
There was the one where a guy pulled someone out of a burning car and they said ex-felon

2071
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:57,200
saved, instead of going to a job interview, saved someone from a burning car.

2072
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:59,760
Why the fuck do you have to bring up that he's a fucking felon in the headline?

2073
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:00,760
No.

2074
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:06,080
And then the other one was that there was a lady who sent ricin to President Obama and

2075
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:07,440
they used her headshot.

2076
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:08,440
Former actress.

2077
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:09,440
Right.

2078
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:10,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2079
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:11,440
So.

2080
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:14,240
Fucking unbelievable.

2081
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:20,240
Or just, just the way that the white lady shot, the Australian white lady shot by the

2082
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:22,440
cops is treated so differently.

2083
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:23,440
And the chief of police.

2084
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:24,440
The police chief resigned.

2085
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:26,720
She didn't get fired.

2086
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:27,720
She resigned.

2087
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:28,720
Yeah.

2088
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:29,720
Over it.

2089
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:30,720
Un-fucking-believable.

2090
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:36,720
It's all, it's like if it weren't so tragic and, you know, a sign of what our society's

2091
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:38,300
up to, it would be comical.

2092
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:41,360
Like the actual elements of it are farce.

2093
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:45,920
But be that as it may, that's kind of where we leave off September 11th, 2015.

2094
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,920
Not a whole lot of talk about September 11th.

2095
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:48,920
Never forget.

2096
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:49,920
Really.

2097
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:52,120
He has an interview with our favorite homophobic pastor, Chuck Baldwin.

2098
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:57,080
He is the guy who said that no civilization that has officially endorsed homosexuality

2099
01:35:57,080 --> 01:35:58,080
has ever survived.

2100
01:35:58,080 --> 01:35:59,080
Oh, that's true.

2101
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:03,240
He goes on to say a bunch more homophobic stuff, and they scream about how Christianity

2102
01:36:03,240 --> 01:36:08,720
is responsible for saving people from slavery, all sorts of, you know, everything that's

2103
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:09,920
good that's ever happened is Christianity.

2104
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:12,440
Everything that's good that's ever happened is Christian.

2105
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:15,640
Even when Christians did bad stuff, well, that's because they weren't Christians.

2106
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:16,640
Yeah.

2107
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:17,640
So.

2108
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:18,640
They were doing bad stuff.

2109
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:19,640
So that was on the 11th, and then.

2110
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:23,800
It's as if, regardless of your religion, people are capable of doing good and bad.

2111
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:24,800
Yeah.

2112
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:25,800
So the 11th is a Friday.

2113
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:30,160
Then, over the weekend, Alex Jones goes to the hike and bike trail and jumps into the

2114
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:32,040
lake and ends up with an ear infection.

2115
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:35,700
So he's gone on Sunday, David Knight hosts on the 13th.

2116
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:37,760
David Knight hosts again on the 14th.

2117
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:40,920
So he can skip past those, and we get back to the 15th.

2118
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:44,320
And it's weird, because he ended the 11th show talking about how Christianity has done

2119
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:46,640
everything great for civilization.

2120
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:52,380
And he comes back on the 15th, and he wants to talk a whole bunch about West.

2121
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:53,380
The West.

2122
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:54,640
God damn it.

2123
01:36:54,640 --> 01:37:01,040
And it's very similar stuff, but instead of religion, it's based in the West.

2124
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:05,400
And I would posit, he does not have a good handle on history.

2125
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:06,960
But we can discuss that on the 11th.

2126
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:09,260
Oh, oh, did we just discover that now?

2127
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:11,280
We can discuss that on the other end of this book.

2128
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:15,640
All I've been taught my whole life was how evil the West was.

2129
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:18,080
How inherently bad white people were.

2130
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:30,560
And then I studied history from even foreign perspectives, and it's just not true.

2131
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:37,320
And why the West is great, and why I say it's the best, on average, some cultures are better

2132
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:43,160
than other things for whatever manifestation, whatever manifest destiny reason.

2133
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:46,680
Just like different breeds of dogs behave differently and have different attributes.

2134
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:51,000
White dogs are better.

2135
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:55,760
The West has been the great innovator.

2136
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:58,920
The great builders, the great scientists.

2137
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:07,040
Now much of the ideas of the West has come from the East, come from the South, come from

2138
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:09,240
even older cultures.

2139
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:15,760
But for whatever reason, many of those cultures fell before and never rose back up.

2140
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:22,520
And the West, the Romans particularly, were great innovators at grabbing other cultures

2141
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:23,920
and using it.

2142
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:30,120
When other cultures tended to not innovate, they intended to invent things, but then not

2143
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:31,880
innovate off of that.

2144
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:33,240
I don't know what that means.

2145
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:34,240
On average.

2146
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:35,240
I do.

2147
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:37,960
And so it was the West that was the melting pot.

2148
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:47,160
It was the West, early on, that actually wasn't racist and sectarian like some of the other

2149
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:48,160
groups.

2150
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:50,360
Now the West became like that later.

2151
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:51,360
Sure.

2152
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:57,720
So I have a lot of historical thoughts, but first is...

2153
01:38:57,720 --> 01:38:59,600
Where do we start with his bullshit there?

2154
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:02,280
I'll try and work backwards.

2155
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:05,240
I want to start at the beginning, all right?

2156
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:07,840
Go ahead.

2157
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:08,840
The idea that...

2158
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:11,120
First there was God.

2159
01:39:11,120 --> 01:39:12,120
The idea that...

2160
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:13,520
Then he created the stars and the...

2161
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:14,520
Okay.

2162
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:18,440
The idea that old-time West civilizations weren't racist is patently absurd.

2163
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:22,600
I haven't studied Rome all that much, but I've studied Greece extensively.

2164
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:26,160
It's a big part of my college education.

2165
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:30,440
And one of the things, just a great example that's very easy for people to analyze and

2166
01:39:30,440 --> 01:39:33,640
understand is that, you know the word barbarian?

2167
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:34,640
You know where it comes from?

2168
01:39:34,640 --> 01:39:35,640
No.

2169
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:36,640
It comes from the Greek.

2170
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:37,640
Barbary.

2171
01:39:37,640 --> 01:39:43,720
Barbaros, which is a term for people outside invading because they thought that everybody

2172
01:39:43,720 --> 01:39:44,720
who didn't...

2173
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:45,720
Do you mean immigrants?

2174
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:46,720
Yeah, they did.

2175
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:49,480
They thought, well, they had a really interesting idea about having to take people into your

2176
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:50,480
home.

2177
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:51,480
Strangers, they had like a...

2178
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:52,480
They had a neighbor.

2179
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:53,480
Yeah.

2180
01:39:53,480 --> 01:39:59,800
They had a very complicated thing with actual people, but big groups, they would...

2181
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:01,680
Barbarian comes from barbar.

2182
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:03,740
They thought that everyone just said barbar.

2183
01:40:03,740 --> 01:40:06,240
They didn't respect anyone else's language or any culture.

2184
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:07,240
Oh.

2185
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:08,240
Yeah.

2186
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:09,240
It was like woof woof.

2187
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:10,720
It was just an onomatopoeia kind of thing.

2188
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:12,680
Those who say barbar became barbarians.

2189
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:13,680
Okay.

2190
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:15,640
And that's where the word comes from to this day.

2191
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:16,820
That's really fascinating.

2192
01:40:16,820 --> 01:40:20,740
There's tons of stuff like that throughout the history of Greece and Rome.

2193
01:40:20,740 --> 01:40:24,160
They were very terrible with other cultures and civilizations.

2194
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:25,160
Right.

2195
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:29,540
Secondly, the idea that Rome was like this great innovator that took things from other

2196
01:40:29,540 --> 01:40:34,800
cultures and then made it better, they conquered everybody.

2197
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:35,800
They just took things.

2198
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:36,800
They killed everybody.

2199
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:37,800
They took things.

2200
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:38,800
Yeah.

2201
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:39,800
You know what else they took?

2202
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:40,800
Their land.

2203
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:41,800
They took over everything.

2204
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:42,800
They were an empire.

2205
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:43,800
Yeah.

2206
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:44,800
They were a complete empire.

2207
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:50,240
So then, the idea that the West is the great innovators, I would just have pulled up a

2208
01:40:50,240 --> 01:41:00,120
list of Chinese inventions, paper, printing, movable type, gunpowder, compass, alcoholic

2209
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:07,200
beverages, bells, wooden coffins, daggers, lacquer, millet cultivation, noodles, rowing

2210
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:15,160
ores, plowshares, pottery, pottery urns, the ability to cultivate rice, soybean cultivation,

2211
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:19,560
acupuncture, banknotes.

2212
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:20,560
You know what?

2213
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:21,560
We can stop at acupuncture.

2214
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:22,560
Belts.

2215
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:25,480
I think you should have just stopped right before acupuncture, actually.

2216
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:26,480
Belts.

2217
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:27,480
Bombs.

2218
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:28,480
Blast furnaces.

2219
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:29,480
Bristle toothbrushes.

2220
01:41:29,480 --> 01:41:30,480
Cast iron.

2221
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:35,920
So what you're saying is that it is directly the Chinese fault for the Holocaust.

2222
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:37,960
I think the Chinese cause the Holocaust.

2223
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:46,680
Most types of drill, color printing, crossbows, dominoes.

2224
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:51,920
The thing that drives me insane, before I get, I think everybody gets your point.

2225
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:52,920
Fire lands.

2226
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:53,920
I think everybody gets your point.

2227
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:54,920
Fireworks.

2228
01:41:54,920 --> 01:41:55,920
Fishing reels.

2229
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:56,920
I think everybody gets your point.

2230
01:41:56,920 --> 01:41:57,920
Flame throwers.

2231
01:41:57,920 --> 01:41:58,920
I think zero people have not gotten your point at this point.

2232
01:41:58,920 --> 01:41:59,920
Fragmentation bombs.

2233
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:03,400
Wait, why are we proud of fragmentation bombs?

2234
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:04,400
I don't know.

2235
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:07,840
Hey, let's talk about India and what they've invented.

2236
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:14,400
In the third millennium BC, the Indians invented a flushing toilet.

2237
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:17,080
They invented a fucking flushing toilet.

2238
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:18,940
The Indians invented the ruler.

2239
01:42:18,940 --> 01:42:20,840
They invented the weighing scale.

2240
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:24,880
They invented all sorts of ways to fuck with metal.

2241
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:29,560
The Indians invented the plow that was used to- I think I understand what it was he was

2242
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:33,440
talking about when he said he didn't want to reveal Hillary Clinton's information because

2243
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:34,440
it was self-indulgent.

2244
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:35,440
Shampoo.

2245
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:37,440
The Indians invented shampoo.

2246
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:40,160
The word is based on an Indian word.

2247
01:42:40,160 --> 01:42:42,180
They invented tons of games that we use.

2248
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:45,900
Shoots and ladders is based on an Indian game called Snakes and Ladders.

2249
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:48,920
Well then I will never forgive them.

2250
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:58,040
No, no, so here's the thing that I hear though- The Indians invented indigo dye.

2251
01:42:58,040 --> 01:42:59,400
All right, I'm done.

2252
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:00,760
That's actually pretty amazing.

2253
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:02,400
Although that is the cheapest dye.

2254
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:03,400
So I wear blue jeans.

2255
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:07,600
You and I both listen to that episode of Dala.

2256
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:08,600
Exactly.

2257
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:09,600
All right.

2258
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:10,600
Yes.

2259
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:14,220
The Knowledge Fight, the podcast that references other podcasts.

2260
01:43:14,220 --> 01:43:16,880
We've gone too so far into this episode.

2261
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:24,080
But here's the bigger thing that he just misses entirely.

2262
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:30,320
You pointed out, look at all of these inventions in China and India.

2263
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:34,540
And then he talks about the West being Rome and all of those places.

2264
01:43:34,540 --> 01:43:37,080
Who the fuck was right in the middle?

2265
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:40,260
Who the fuck put together all of these things?

2266
01:43:40,260 --> 01:43:42,880
He says the West was the melting pot?

2267
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:45,880
That is unbelievable bullshit.

2268
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:52,320
Like the Silk Road began and end in the middle.

2269
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:55,100
It didn't start on the West or the East.

2270
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:59,600
It was right there in the fucking middle, in the Middle East.

2271
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:04,960
It was those civilizations that came from Iraq.

2272
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:09,240
Those places were the ones that made us all what we are.

2273
01:44:09,240 --> 01:44:14,320
And the fact that he pretends that it's the East or the West boggles my mind.

2274
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:17,360
That is a complete misrepresentation of all of history.

2275
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:20,960
And we don't have fucking time to go through all of the Middle Eastern countries and their

2276
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:21,960
innovation.

2277
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:22,960
Just start with zero.

2278
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:25,120
The number zero.

2279
01:44:25,120 --> 01:44:30,640
Or Africa, the things that have come out of Africa or South America.

2280
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:35,120
All the world's cultures have had innovation within them.

2281
01:44:35,120 --> 01:44:38,840
All the world's cultures have brought us amazing things that we use.

2282
01:44:38,840 --> 01:44:39,840
And the most-

2283
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:40,840
It's fucking absurd.

2284
01:44:40,840 --> 01:44:48,280
The important part is that the areas where they all met, the areas where everybody mixed,

2285
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:53,520
that's where things got a lot better and a lot more interesting a lot faster.

2286
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:56,920
Everywhere where it's isolated, everywhere.

2287
01:44:56,920 --> 01:45:02,480
When you're talking about Africa, especially in the historical context, generally people

2288
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:05,480
wind up talking about Egypt.

2289
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:07,040
Those central parts of Africa-

2290
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:08,040
Because it had access.

2291
01:45:08,040 --> 01:45:09,040
Exactly.

2292
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:15,600
Where you can still see indigenous people today, they are so isolated that they never

2293
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:18,280
wound up interacting with all of this insane stuff.

2294
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:21,120
Because they weren't in the North and they weren't close to other-

2295
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:22,120
Yep.

2296
01:45:22,120 --> 01:45:23,120
And they didn't have ports.

2297
01:45:23,120 --> 01:45:24,120
Yeah.

2298
01:45:24,120 --> 01:45:25,120
Like Egypt had ports.

2299
01:45:25,120 --> 01:45:26,120
Exactly.

2300
01:45:26,120 --> 01:45:31,000
So you had people that came in boats from far off lands and had to go through them in

2301
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:32,320
order to do anything.

2302
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:33,320
Exactly.

2303
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:34,320
The idea of the West-

2304
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:36,760
That's how the Library of Alexandria got so big and then burned down.

2305
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:44,720
The idea of isolation is the idea of completely removing any innovation or invention or anything

2306
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:45,720
like that.

2307
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:46,720
Nationalism.

2308
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:47,720
Exactly.

2309
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:48,720
Yeah.

2310
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:49,720
It's a great plan.

2311
01:45:49,720 --> 01:45:53,480
If you want the world to die, nationalism is the way you do it.

2312
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:54,480
All right.

2313
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:59,120
So I mean, Alex has a lot of really fucked up views about the West and he's wrong about

2314
01:45:59,120 --> 01:46:01,200
most of them, as we've discussed.

2315
01:46:01,200 --> 01:46:03,080
But get this.

2316
01:46:03,080 --> 01:46:06,400
This next clip is super bizarre.

2317
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:12,760
We know Alex Jones as a man who's primarily against tyranny.

2318
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:14,840
That is what he's afraid of.

2319
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:16,640
Theoretically primarily against tyranny.

2320
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:18,680
Well, based on his words.

2321
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:24,480
His sort of world conception is that the liberals are not really liberals.

2322
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:29,600
They want to push socialism, which will lead to communism, which will lead to a totalitarian

2323
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:31,680
regime tyranny.

2324
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:33,580
That is his big fear.

2325
01:46:33,580 --> 01:46:37,360
He doesn't understand how much fewer steps it takes to get to tyranny.

2326
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:38,360
We're there.

2327
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:39,360
We're way past it.

2328
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:40,360
We're real close.

2329
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:41,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2330
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:44,240
But he has this like, that is what has driven his career.

2331
01:46:44,240 --> 01:46:48,920
Now, as I talked about at the beginning of this episode, there's also that weird pseudo-spiritual

2332
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:54,120
shit that's going on in the background, but in terms of what he's really willing to present

2333
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:58,400
as his overarching theme, it's a fight against tyranny.

2334
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:01,660
That is how he sort of presents himself all the time.

2335
01:47:01,660 --> 01:47:05,440
This next clip is super fucked up when you keep that in mind.

2336
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:09,600
The globalists do not want you to be perceptive.

2337
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:11,480
They do not want you to be powerful.

2338
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:13,600
They do not want you to be free.

2339
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:16,480
They are incredible enslavers.

2340
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:20,120
And all I know is they're not good.

2341
01:47:20,120 --> 01:47:24,960
They claim they're engaging in all this tyranny to bring in a total control system to protect

2342
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:28,640
the earth from wars and factions killing each other.

2343
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:29,640
That's not right.

2344
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:30,880
I'll be honest with you.

2345
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:34,760
If there was a quasi-tyranny, I'm just going to be totally honest from now on, that had

2346
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:40,520
good friends and empowered individuals, but went and shut down really bad people, I would

2347
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:44,560
say it was a lesser of evils, very dangerous, might become the ultimate tyranny down the

2348
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:50,160
road, but I wouldn't fight it to the point of putting my full will against it to where

2349
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:51,960
I try to force his hand against me.

2350
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:54,460
What the fuck does that mean?

2351
01:47:54,460 --> 01:47:57,980
What he just said is tyranny is cool as long as it's on my side.

2352
01:47:57,980 --> 01:47:59,560
As long as it's the right kind of tyranny.

2353
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:00,840
As long as it's on my side.

2354
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:01,840
Right.

2355
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:04,080
That's incredibly fucked up.

2356
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:06,200
That should invalidate most of his beliefs.

2357
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:07,640
That should invalidate everything.

2358
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:10,440
That means he has no principles, he's just on a team.

2359
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:12,760
It's just that his team is weird.

2360
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:21,080
His team is not the republicans necessarily, it's not even libertarians, it's anti-government

2361
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:23,320
weird constitutionalists.

2362
01:48:23,320 --> 01:48:31,420
That really is one of those things where you do point back, like, I shit all over the founding

2363
01:48:31,420 --> 01:48:36,600
congresses, I refuse to call them the founding fathers.

2364
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:37,600
That's fucking annoying.

2365
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:38,920
It's patriarchal.

2366
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:39,920
Fucking annoying.

2367
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:42,680
Not patriarchal, just very...

2368
01:48:42,680 --> 01:48:43,680
It's like saying the...

2369
01:48:43,680 --> 01:48:45,880
Call them the founding daddies.

2370
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:51,560
It's like saying the Pledge of Allegiance, it's super weird, just in a gross way.

2371
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:56,040
But the Framers of the Constitution, I don't know why that's better for me.

2372
01:48:56,040 --> 01:48:58,320
It doesn't have fathers in the name.

2373
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:01,520
The guys who jerked off onto paper and made it words.

2374
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:02,520
Sure.

2375
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:05,480
They did an ooky cookie with the paper.

2376
01:49:05,480 --> 01:49:07,640
I am trying so hard to get to a point.

2377
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:09,240
Which you are failing at.

2378
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:10,240
Awful.

2379
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:16,560
The one thing that I do give them is that all of those guys really did come from it

2380
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:18,520
from different angles.

2381
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:25,440
Like there were, in general, the same concept of Republicans and Democrats that we have

2382
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:26,440
now.

2383
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:30,800
Well, it's flipped, but there were a bunch of times that there were liberal and conservative

2384
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:31,800
folk.

2385
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:32,800
Yes, progressive and conservative.

2386
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:33,800
Yeah, yeah.

2387
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:36,800
I mean, Jefferson and Washington had incredibly different perspectives.

2388
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:37,800
Exactly.

2389
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:38,800
Exactly.

2390
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:41,940
And they disagreed with each other loud and hard.

2391
01:49:41,940 --> 01:49:46,280
But at the end of the day, all of them were against kings.

2392
01:49:46,280 --> 01:49:47,280
Yeah.

2393
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:48,280
Tyranny.

2394
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:50,520
They didn't fucking throw everything.

2395
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:51,520
You guys want taxes?

2396
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:52,520
I hate taxes.

2397
01:49:52,520 --> 01:49:54,580
But no fucking kings.

2398
01:49:54,580 --> 01:49:55,920
Like they all agreed on that.

2399
01:49:55,920 --> 01:49:58,720
And you know what else they would not be thrilled with?

2400
01:49:58,720 --> 01:49:59,720
Quasi-kings.

2401
01:49:59,720 --> 01:50:00,720
Yeah.

2402
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:01,720
Yeah.

2403
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:03,280
I'm cool with quasi-tyranny.

2404
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:05,120
Maybe it turns into tyranny down the road.

2405
01:50:05,120 --> 01:50:06,120
But right now it's quasi-tyranny.

2406
01:50:06,120 --> 01:50:08,440
And it might be the most dangerous thing ever.

2407
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:09,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2408
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:10,440
What is that?

2409
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:11,440
No.

2410
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:17,760
That is the one thing that you can point to with our overarching idea of the overarching

2411
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:24,200
idea of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution is no kings.

2412
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:28,320
And right now we have a political party that is for kings.

2413
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:30,280
Well, I mean, you look at it.

2414
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:36,200
Well, and probably 40% of the other party is, like the way that we've expanded executive

2415
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:40,720
powers is beyond reason, especially under Obama.

2416
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:41,720
Totally.

2417
01:50:41,720 --> 01:50:47,200
Now that was maybe in response to the fact that we had the most obstructive Congress

2418
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:48,440
in history.

2419
01:50:48,440 --> 01:50:52,160
And so the only way to actually get anything done is for Obama to be like, fuck it, I'm

2420
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:53,160
doing it.

2421
01:50:53,160 --> 01:50:57,800
And the largest financial crisis in recorded, not recorded history, but in recent memory.

2422
01:50:57,800 --> 01:50:58,800
Definitely not recorded history.

2423
01:50:58,800 --> 01:50:59,800
No, but in recent memory.

2424
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:00,800
Yeah, absolutely.

2425
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:06,000
And a bunch of wars and the fact that our healthcare system was in desperate need of

2426
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:07,000
something.

2427
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Yeah.

2428
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,420
There's a whole list of reasons why it happened.

2429
01:51:10,420 --> 01:51:11,420
It's not good, though.

2430
01:51:11,420 --> 01:51:12,960
But that's how you get tyranny.

2431
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:13,960
Right.

2432
01:51:13,960 --> 01:51:18,400
And a whole bunch of crises come together and people fuck up along the way.

2433
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:23,240
And once Trump gets away with everything that he's been doing, we'll be 100% there.

2434
01:51:23,240 --> 01:51:27,280
He has, he will and has gotten away with everything.

2435
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:28,280
Yep.

2436
01:51:28,280 --> 01:51:30,780
And Alex will cheerlead all the way.

2437
01:51:30,780 --> 01:51:36,880
So also a couple more points about this September 15th episode before we get to more clips.

2438
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:43,120
It opened with a Jon Bound report that was about how Assad is a real cool dude doing

2439
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:44,240
a great job in Syria.

2440
01:51:44,240 --> 01:51:45,840
All he's doing is fighting ISIS.

2441
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:46,840
Yeah.

2442
01:51:46,840 --> 01:51:47,840
Yeah.

2443
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:48,840
Nonsense.

2444
01:51:48,840 --> 01:51:49,840
Fighting ISIS.

2445
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:51,600
Also, I realized why so many episodes start with a Jon Bound report.

2446
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:57,600
And that is because the radio stations start at six of the hour.

2447
01:51:57,600 --> 01:52:00,440
The shows start at six after.

2448
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:04,040
They have their commercials and station identification or what have you.

2449
01:52:04,040 --> 01:52:07,480
And so almost every episode of the show now starts with a Jon Bound report.

2450
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:09,580
And I'm like, why is he on every fucking day?

2451
01:52:09,580 --> 01:52:10,580
These reports are terrible.

2452
01:52:10,580 --> 01:52:15,440
And it's just because he got to fill time until the stations actually pick up the show.

2453
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:21,040
So yeah, they're doing more pro Assad stuff, more pro Russia business.

2454
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:28,720
Then being pro Assad is such a, such a perfect bellwether of whether or not you should kill

2455
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:29,720
yourself.

2456
01:52:29,720 --> 01:52:30,720
Yeah.

2457
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:32,840
Like if you're pro Assad, just fucking die now.

2458
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:33,840
I'm okay with that.

2459
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:39,240
Alex is super mad about a story that he read about LA trying to call themselves the capital

2460
01:52:39,240 --> 01:52:40,720
of Latin America.

2461
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:44,120
Uh, well, you know why they did that?

2462
01:52:44,120 --> 01:52:47,520
It was a desperate sales pitch to try and get the Olympics.

2463
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:50,800
I was going to say, I'm sorry, the world cup, they were trying to get the world cup to come

2464
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:57,320
to LA and it was part of a PR campaign talking about how, uh, you know, North America is

2465
01:52:57,320 --> 01:53:02,600
one and you know, they are the capital of Latin America and Alex is like, no, it's just

2466
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:04,920
about the North American union coming together.

2467
01:53:04,920 --> 01:53:07,040
This is them coming out into the open globalist.

2468
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:13,680
No, they wanted to make a ton of money in Los Angeles by, well, in regards to the world

2469
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:18,400
cup, a very small amount of people wanted to make a very large amount of money and fuck

2470
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:19,640
over everybody.

2471
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:21,000
And thankfully that didn't happen.

2472
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Yeah.

2473
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:26,720
But although they will probably get the Olympics, so they'll be fucking us over in some way.

2474
01:53:26,720 --> 01:53:30,200
And that's why I, that's why I had that brain fart calling at the Olympics.

2475
01:53:30,200 --> 01:53:37,440
But be that as it may, uh, we need to check in Alex, like I said, in that, uh, a couple

2476
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:43,680
of, a couple of days back called Trump a punk, called him, told him to shut his fat mouth.

2477
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:48,300
And then the next day Trump backpedaled, Trump backpedaled and Alex softened.

2478
01:53:48,300 --> 01:53:53,520
So now we've got to check in Alex Jones on this 15th of September has some thoughts about

2479
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:54,520
Trump.

2480
01:53:54,520 --> 01:53:55,520
Here's where we're at.

2481
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:58,480
When I get mad at Rand Paul and say he should be more aggressive and sound more like Trump

2482
01:53:58,480 --> 01:54:01,340
because I love Rand Paul, I know he's for real.

2483
01:54:01,340 --> 01:54:02,340
I support him.

2484
01:54:02,340 --> 01:54:03,340
I want him to win.

2485
01:54:03,340 --> 01:54:09,240
I trust him, but I know he's listening to more milk toast political advisors that say

2486
01:54:09,240 --> 01:54:14,200
that Trump's going to get destroyed in a general election because he's too extreme.

2487
01:54:14,200 --> 01:54:15,200
He's not extreme.

2488
01:54:15,200 --> 01:54:17,320
I don't know if I trust Trump or not.

2489
01:54:17,320 --> 01:54:22,680
I don't know him, but I do know what he's saying is true.

2490
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:24,240
And that's why he's so popular.

2491
01:54:24,240 --> 01:54:25,720
We're back to where we started.

2492
01:54:25,720 --> 01:54:27,920
Of course we have made no progress.

2493
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:28,920
None.

2494
01:54:28,920 --> 01:54:29,920
He went.

2495
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:30,920
It just went back.

2496
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:31,920
Back.

2497
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:32,920
Back.

2498
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:33,920
Yeah.

2499
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:34,920
It just.

2500
01:54:34,920 --> 01:54:35,920
There is there is a will they won't they thing going on.

2501
01:54:35,920 --> 01:54:38,720
And the baseline is I like what he's saying, but I don't trust him.

2502
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:46,100
I think his real problem so far seems to be that Rand Paul actually believes in what Alex

2503
01:54:46,100 --> 01:54:50,960
Jones says he believes and Alex Jones doesn't actually believe in what he says he believes.

2504
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:52,600
That might be part of the tension.

2505
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:54,980
Like that's what it seems to me like.

2506
01:54:54,980 --> 01:54:57,760
And I think Rand Paul's a little smarter than Alex.

2507
01:54:57,760 --> 01:55:00,160
Rand Paul is so much smarter than Alex.

2508
01:55:00,160 --> 01:55:06,760
But in terms of knowing like what is possible, what isn't possible, I think Rand Paul's also

2509
01:55:06,760 --> 01:55:08,160
a fucking dick.

2510
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:09,160
Absolutely.

2511
01:55:09,160 --> 01:55:11,520
I think he's a disaster.

2512
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:16,960
He seems to be an ideologically consistent dick, which is something that we cannot say

2513
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:17,960
about Alex.

2514
01:55:17,960 --> 01:55:18,960
No.

2515
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:19,960
He just said he's cool with partial tyranny.

2516
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:20,960
Yeah.

2517
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:21,960
So yeah.

2518
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:22,960
Alex is nonsense.

2519
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:23,960
It's a complete mess.

2520
01:55:23,960 --> 01:55:24,960
So.

2521
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:25,960
Alex is the wind.

2522
01:55:25,960 --> 01:55:27,520
He blows wherever it may.

2523
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:31,840
On this episode, he has that interview with the guy from the Citizens for Guns or whatever.

2524
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:33,800
I can't remember the name of the organization.

2525
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:34,800
And I'll tell you this.

2526
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:35,800
Citizens for Guns.

2527
01:55:35,800 --> 01:55:36,800
It's not important.

2528
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:37,800
That might as well be.

2529
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:38,800
Might as well be the name.

2530
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:39,800
Yeah.

2531
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:43,120
It's just a guy who's super into guns.

2532
01:55:43,120 --> 01:55:46,160
And he has a terrible Skype.

2533
01:55:46,160 --> 01:55:49,680
He's just sitting in a room doing this interview with Alex.

2534
01:55:49,680 --> 01:55:53,660
And they end up having this conversation.

2535
01:55:53,660 --> 01:55:58,360
This is the second instance of complete historical revisionism.

2536
01:55:58,360 --> 01:56:02,020
I think it's slightly less offensive than the Holocaust denial that Alex engaged in

2537
01:56:02,020 --> 01:56:05,060
previously, but it is just as whack.

2538
01:56:05,060 --> 01:56:08,000
Federal government, you can go here and no farther.

2539
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:12,520
And if you try, then the Second Amendment comes into play.

2540
01:56:12,520 --> 01:56:18,400
To put it a little bit more crudely, we'll point our guns at you if you try to act tyrannically.

2541
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:22,520
And that's in the Declaration of Independence, in the Constitution, in the Bill of Rights.

2542
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:25,680
The war started over them coming to take the guns.

2543
01:56:25,680 --> 01:56:30,200
It doesn't matter how many quack professors they pay from Bloomberg to write books claiming

2544
01:56:30,200 --> 01:56:32,000
it wasn't about guns.

2545
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:35,000
It was all about self-defense.

2546
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:36,720
It's always about self-defense.

2547
01:56:36,720 --> 01:56:39,080
It's always about being free.

2548
01:56:39,080 --> 01:56:42,280
The Revolutionary War was about guns.

2549
01:56:42,280 --> 01:56:43,280
Yeah.

2550
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:44,280
The UK.

2551
01:56:44,280 --> 01:56:45,280
That's obvious.

2552
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:46,280
Okay.

2553
01:56:46,280 --> 01:56:47,280
Who has not read history?

2554
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:48,280
Alex.

2555
01:56:48,280 --> 01:56:52,080
Don't you remember in 1776 when they wrote the Declaration of Independence, they were

2556
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:55,560
like, guns!

2557
01:56:55,560 --> 01:56:57,800
That's why it was the Second Amendment.

2558
01:56:57,800 --> 01:57:04,080
Yeah, I think that there were more issues about taxation, certainly.

2559
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:06,880
Alex loves to bring up tariffs when he talks about the Civil War.

2560
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:09,080
This one might be more appropriate.

2561
01:57:09,080 --> 01:57:10,080
There was that.

2562
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:11,080
There was the lack of recourse.

2563
01:57:11,080 --> 01:57:14,080
There was a lack of redress of grievances.

2564
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:16,240
There was no representation.

2565
01:57:16,240 --> 01:57:19,080
Those sorts of issues seem to be more important.

2566
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:24,280
I know that the tea party, the Boston Tea Party, was not about guns.

2567
01:57:24,280 --> 01:57:25,280
I know that.

2568
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:26,280
Hmm.

2569
01:57:26,280 --> 01:57:27,280
Maybe it was.

2570
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:28,280
What else you got?

2571
01:57:28,280 --> 01:57:29,280
Maybe it was.

2572
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:30,280
What else you got?

2573
01:57:30,280 --> 01:57:31,280
Maybe they were throwing...

2574
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:32,280
Give me six more examples.

2575
01:57:32,280 --> 01:57:34,120
I don't need to.

2576
01:57:34,120 --> 01:57:35,600
Alex has no examples.

2577
01:57:35,600 --> 01:57:36,600
None.

2578
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:37,600
I mean...

2579
01:57:37,600 --> 01:57:38,600
It's just an assertion.

2580
01:57:38,600 --> 01:57:43,080
It's just an assertion that the Revolutionary War was about guns.

2581
01:57:43,080 --> 01:57:45,120
What?

2582
01:57:45,120 --> 01:57:50,640
I mean, what do you say to a person who believes that?

2583
01:57:50,640 --> 01:57:54,820
What do you say to somebody who believes that the Civil War was about states' rights or

2584
01:57:54,820 --> 01:57:56,440
tariffs?

2585
01:57:56,440 --> 01:57:59,320
What words are possible?

2586
01:57:59,320 --> 01:58:02,120
I think that there's a way, though, to...

2587
01:58:02,120 --> 01:58:03,720
Tariffs, no.

2588
01:58:03,720 --> 01:58:04,720
That's not true.

2589
01:58:04,720 --> 01:58:11,840
But I think there is a way to look back on what happened in the course of the Civil War

2590
01:58:11,840 --> 01:58:18,000
and rewrite it reasonably with the states' rights.

2591
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,440
It's not what was going on then.

2592
01:58:20,440 --> 01:58:22,440
This is gonna be a dangerous argument for me to make.

2593
01:58:22,440 --> 01:58:24,400
This is already dangerous territory.

2594
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:31,400
I think that in hindsight, you can make the argument that what they were trying to argue

2595
01:58:31,400 --> 01:58:33,260
was states' rights.

2596
01:58:33,260 --> 01:58:37,520
That we should be able to decide whatever is legal in our state, federal government,

2597
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:38,520
get out, whatever.

2598
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:39,520
Uh-huh.

2599
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:40,520
Like, I think you can do that.

2600
01:58:40,520 --> 01:58:45,360
You can't use what they were saying back then to make your argument, because it's not true.

2601
01:58:45,360 --> 01:58:46,960
It's clearly about slavery.

2602
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:48,960
But you could do that.

2603
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:53,100
I don't think you can do that with the Revolutionary War being about guns.

2604
01:58:53,100 --> 01:58:54,100
Absolutely not.

2605
01:58:54,100 --> 01:58:55,100
Because I don't think that...

2606
01:58:55,100 --> 01:58:56,100
Do you know what...

2607
01:58:56,100 --> 01:59:02,520
I don't think the primary disagreement between the British and us was gun ownership.

2608
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:10,200
Do you know what the primary disagreement that is a through line between the Revolutionary

2609
01:59:10,200 --> 01:59:11,760
War and the Civil War?

2610
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:12,760
What's that?

2611
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:14,280
Rich people are fucking us over.

2612
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:15,760
Yeah, that's true.

2613
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:18,520
That's what the argument has been.

2614
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:20,800
That's what the argument has always been.

2615
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:23,840
And in the Revolutionary War, it was the rich British are fucking us over.

2616
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:24,840
Yep.

2617
01:59:24,840 --> 01:59:25,840
And the Civil War...

2618
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:27,920
It was the rich Southerners are fucking us over.

2619
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:28,920
Yeah.

2620
01:59:28,920 --> 01:59:29,920
It was the rich...

2621
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:32,520
The rich people are...

2622
01:59:32,520 --> 01:59:36,320
Okay, and I don't want to pull out a...

2623
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:39,320
And the Southerners were rich because they were enslaving people.

2624
01:59:39,320 --> 01:59:40,520
Exactly.

2625
01:59:40,520 --> 01:59:43,320
And it wasn't even the Southerners.

2626
01:59:43,320 --> 01:59:45,840
It was a very small number of Southerners.

2627
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:48,180
And then it was racism.

2628
01:59:48,180 --> 01:59:52,480
It was the propaganda that they'd been fed the whole time about how black people aren't

2629
01:59:52,480 --> 01:59:54,040
even really people.

2630
01:59:54,040 --> 01:59:55,640
It is always...

2631
01:59:55,640 --> 02:00:02,200
And I'm not gonna pull a hardcore socialist argument out.

2632
02:00:02,200 --> 02:00:08,040
I am just going to point out the same thing that has always been true, that it's a rich

2633
02:00:08,040 --> 02:00:10,480
man's war and a poor man's fight.

2634
02:00:10,480 --> 02:00:14,160
Rich people always wind up fucking fine.

2635
02:00:14,160 --> 02:00:18,000
They always wind up winning, regardless of who wins.

2636
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,240
Oh, fuck, fucking fuck.

2637
02:00:20,240 --> 02:00:21,240
Fuck you.

2638
02:00:21,240 --> 02:00:22,240
They're smart.

2639
02:00:22,240 --> 02:00:23,240
They're fucking insane.

2640
02:00:23,240 --> 02:00:28,680
I mean smart in terms of cunning, in terms of an evil ability to, no matter what the

2641
02:00:28,680 --> 02:00:33,080
outcome, I'm gonna benefit from it.

2642
02:00:33,080 --> 02:00:35,760
They're privy to more information than everybody else.

2643
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:37,640
They're not smart.

2644
02:00:37,640 --> 02:00:39,140
It's like insider training.

2645
02:00:39,140 --> 02:00:40,780
It's not like they're brilliant.

2646
02:00:40,780 --> 02:00:43,000
It's that they know a day...

2647
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:48,720
The guys who voted on the healthcare bill were like, okay, well, we're gonna invest

2648
02:00:48,720 --> 02:00:56,440
in the same day on companies that stand to profit from this exact vote.

2649
02:00:56,440 --> 02:00:57,960
It's not that they're smarter than us.

2650
02:00:57,960 --> 02:01:00,180
It's that they're fucking us over.

2651
02:01:00,180 --> 02:01:04,000
But it's manipulating a system that we allow to continue.

2652
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Yeah, exactly.

2653
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:06,000
So Jordan.

2654
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:07,000
Yes.

2655
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:10,680
Before September 15th, something really fucked up happened.

2656
02:01:10,680 --> 02:01:19,040
September 14th, Donald Trump had a rally in Texas, and Joe Biggs went to the rally.

2657
02:01:19,040 --> 02:01:23,680
Oh, I bet he has some insider information we would never have found out without him.

2658
02:01:23,680 --> 02:01:30,520
Now, I have a couple clips from Joe Biggs reporting about going to the Trump rally that

2659
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:39,000
I think bring into sharp focus the moment when Alex Jones realized Trump's the way to

2660
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:40,000
go.

2661
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:41,000
Really?

2662
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:42,000
Yeah.

2663
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:43,000
No shit.

2664
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:48,280
Now, I'm not entirely sure about this, and Alex doesn't give a lot of indications that

2665
02:01:48,280 --> 02:01:52,840
I'm correct, but I will make my argument over the course of the next three or four clips.

2666
02:01:52,840 --> 02:01:56,320
Two or three hours, basically, is what you just said.

2667
02:01:56,320 --> 02:01:58,540
No, we got way more than that.

2668
02:01:58,540 --> 02:02:03,360
Here is the first clip of Joe Biggs reporting about going to the Trump rally.

2669
02:02:03,360 --> 02:02:06,320
And again, it is not what you'd expect.

2670
02:02:06,320 --> 02:02:07,320
Gotta get to the Trump situation.

2671
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:09,360
So you're up there for Lord Trump-ish.

2672
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:10,360
What happened?

2673
02:02:10,360 --> 02:02:13,760
I went in there with an open mind, you know?

2674
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:15,600
He says a lot of good things out there, you know?

2675
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:20,120
He's definitely a crowd pleaser, and I wrote down on this piece of paper that he was lackluster.

2676
02:02:20,120 --> 02:02:24,640
He's lackluster in the sense that he's not motivated or convicted in a sense when it

2677
02:02:24,640 --> 02:02:26,740
comes to the issues at hand.

2678
02:02:26,740 --> 02:02:31,840
Issues that a presidential candidate should be, you know, have conviction in, have knowledge

2679
02:02:31,840 --> 02:02:32,840
in.

2680
02:02:32,840 --> 02:02:36,840
When he's asked certain questions about these issues, he doesn't have a really good answer.

2681
02:02:36,840 --> 02:02:37,840
He doesn't know what he's doing.

2682
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:38,840
Because he doesn't know what they fucking are!

2683
02:02:38,840 --> 02:02:42,640
They're kind of reminding me of Rodney Dangerfield with these one-liners, like, hey, we got a

2684
02:02:42,640 --> 02:02:43,640
border problem, huh?

2685
02:02:43,640 --> 02:02:45,080
What are we going to do about it?

2686
02:02:45,080 --> 02:02:46,080
Let's build a wall.

2687
02:02:46,080 --> 02:02:48,280
All right, so what is a wall going to do?

2688
02:02:48,280 --> 02:02:51,760
All he does is he brings problems to the table without a solution.

2689
02:02:51,760 --> 02:02:54,960
And that's what I heard last night, a whole lot of problems being brought to the table

2690
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:59,920
without him giving any kind of clear path to how he was going to give a solution to

2691
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:01,500
these issues.

2692
02:03:01,500 --> 02:03:05,280
We know a wall won't work contiguously.

2693
02:03:05,280 --> 02:03:08,940
What really works is prosecuting people that hire illegals.

2694
02:03:08,940 --> 02:03:14,280
So at this point, Joe Biggs is doing slightly reasonable reporting.

2695
02:03:14,280 --> 02:03:16,100
That actually sounds pretty reasonable.

2696
02:03:16,100 --> 02:03:21,000
And I'm going to get into this next clip, but that's the beginning of the two of them

2697
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:25,760
kind of advocating for reasonable, moderate immigration reform.

2698
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:31,960
And Trump, er, Jones saying that a wall won't work is mind-boggling.

2699
02:03:31,960 --> 02:03:34,760
When months later, he's screaming about a wall.

2700
02:03:34,760 --> 02:03:35,760
We need a wall.

2701
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:36,760
Yeah, absolutely.

2702
02:03:36,760 --> 02:03:37,760
No.

2703
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:38,760
A wall is the most important thing.

2704
02:03:38,760 --> 02:03:39,760
Yeah.

2705
02:03:39,760 --> 02:03:42,140
Guatemala, there's a wall on the border of Guatemala and Mexico.

2706
02:03:42,140 --> 02:03:43,140
Which there isn't.

2707
02:03:43,140 --> 02:03:49,420
He even has, later, like a couple days past this, he has an interview with Jesse Ventura.

2708
02:03:49,420 --> 02:03:53,600
And Jesse Ventura lives in Mexico, and he's like, what about the wall between Mexico and

2709
02:03:53,600 --> 02:03:54,600
Guatemala?

2710
02:03:54,600 --> 02:03:57,440
And he's like, I don't know if that exists.

2711
02:03:57,440 --> 02:03:58,440
It doesn't.

2712
02:03:58,440 --> 02:03:59,440
It 100% doesn't.

2713
02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:00,440
Of course not.

2714
02:04:00,440 --> 02:04:01,440
He's like, I've never been down there.

2715
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:02,440
I don't know.

2716
02:04:02,440 --> 02:04:03,440
Like, well, they're also looking into it.

2717
02:04:03,440 --> 02:04:04,440
It doesn't exist.

2718
02:04:04,440 --> 02:04:09,700
The last wall that was similar to the one that Trump proposes was the Berlin Wall.

2719
02:04:09,700 --> 02:04:13,200
Which Jesse Ventura also brings up a bunch, and he's great for it.

2720
02:04:13,200 --> 02:04:16,120
But at this point, like, Joe Biggs is making sense.

2721
02:04:16,120 --> 02:04:18,080
He's absolutely making sense.

2722
02:04:18,080 --> 02:04:19,080
Trump has a bunch of-

2723
02:04:19,080 --> 02:04:20,640
He's about to bring the hammer down.

2724
02:04:20,640 --> 02:04:21,640
Not yet.

2725
02:04:21,640 --> 02:04:23,440
Trump has a bunch of problems.

2726
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:24,440
No solutions.

2727
02:04:24,440 --> 02:04:25,440
He's up there.

2728
02:04:25,440 --> 02:04:26,440
He doesn't have a grasp of the issues.

2729
02:04:26,440 --> 02:04:27,440
A lot of bluster.

2730
02:04:27,440 --> 02:04:28,440
Doesn't know what he's talking about.

2731
02:04:28,440 --> 02:04:31,520
He's just coming in with Rodney Dangerfield-style one-liners.

2732
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:33,640
All this is, but he's a showman.

2733
02:04:33,640 --> 02:04:34,640
Right.

2734
02:04:34,640 --> 02:04:35,640
Kind of makes sense.

2735
02:04:35,640 --> 02:04:41,440
In this next clip, they talk a little bit more about immigrant stuff, and Alex is, like,

2736
02:04:41,440 --> 02:04:43,440
surprisingly moderate.

2737
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:44,760
It's very weird.

2738
02:04:44,760 --> 02:04:49,200
For the months that we've listened to him screaming about how the globalists are trying

2739
02:04:49,200 --> 02:04:55,600
to flood us with, you know, people who may need to get rid of them, or not let them in,

2740
02:04:55,600 --> 02:04:56,600
this-

2741
02:04:56,600 --> 02:04:57,600
Comparing the man-

2742
02:04:57,600 --> 02:04:58,600
Hold on.

2743
02:04:58,600 --> 02:04:59,600
Listen to-

2744
02:04:59,600 --> 02:05:00,600
Comparing the man we know now versus the man that we're talking about-

2745
02:05:00,600 --> 02:05:01,600
No.

2746
02:05:01,600 --> 02:05:02,600
I'm talking about the last few months in 2015.

2747
02:05:02,600 --> 02:05:03,600
Oh, in 2015.

2748
02:05:03,600 --> 02:05:04,600
Okay.

2749
02:05:04,600 --> 02:05:05,600
Yeah.

2750
02:05:05,600 --> 02:05:07,840
He's been screaming about fucking immigrants the whole time that we've been doing this

2751
02:05:07,840 --> 02:05:08,840
investigation.

2752
02:05:08,840 --> 02:05:09,840
No, absolutely.

2753
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:10,840
Yeah.

2754
02:05:10,840 --> 02:05:11,840
So, I mean, I'm not talking about present-day Alex.

2755
02:05:11,840 --> 02:05:16,520
I'm talking about the present-day Alex versus the previous Alex in terms of the wall.

2756
02:05:16,520 --> 02:05:17,520
Right, right, right.

2757
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:18,520
That boggles my mind.

2758
02:05:18,520 --> 02:05:19,520
It's nuts.

2759
02:05:19,520 --> 02:05:20,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2760
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:21,520
It's nuts.

2761
02:05:21,520 --> 02:05:23,240
It's complete evidence that he's sold himself out.

2762
02:05:23,240 --> 02:05:24,840
His principles mean nothing.

2763
02:05:24,840 --> 02:05:25,840
Agreed.

2764
02:05:25,840 --> 02:05:31,440
So, here is the- I've labeled this clip, Joe and Alex seem very moderate on immigration

2765
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:32,440
reform.

2766
02:05:32,440 --> 02:05:35,760
You know, Donald Trump said in two years he's going to have every illegal out of the country.

2767
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:39,720
The only way you could do that, it was just like I was fucking Michaela Thelen back there,

2768
02:05:39,720 --> 02:05:40,720
it would be like Nazi Germany.

2769
02:05:40,720 --> 02:05:44,880
They're going to have to go door to door and find out, are you an American?

2770
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:45,880
I need to see proof.

2771
02:05:45,880 --> 02:05:46,880
And that's what's going to happen.

2772
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:49,840
That's the only way you're going to get all the illegals out.

2773
02:05:49,840 --> 02:05:53,000
But then at the same time, you still have illegals in the country who want to do good.

2774
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:58,120
And we're not even saying- all we're saying is don't say free welfare, free babies, come

2775
02:05:58,120 --> 02:06:02,440
here and have the Democrats sign them up to anti-gun groups and give them fake voting

2776
02:06:02,440 --> 02:06:03,440
cards.

2777
02:06:03,440 --> 02:06:04,440
Guns!

2778
02:06:04,440 --> 02:06:07,640
But at the same time, that's reasonable.

2779
02:06:07,640 --> 02:06:11,840
If that was his actual position and if it reflected reality in any way, that's a pretty

2780
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:12,840
reasonable position.

2781
02:06:12,840 --> 02:06:13,840
It's not terrible.

2782
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:18,480
It's not what he actually believes, but it's the way he presents things.

2783
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:19,480
Joe Biggs-

2784
02:06:19,480 --> 02:06:23,120
That's like a McCain Republican idea.

2785
02:06:23,120 --> 02:06:29,520
Like in 2008 when McCain ran, like that's the kind of idea of like, hey, we know a lot

2786
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:33,800
of people are good, but we just don't want you taking advantage of a system.

2787
02:06:33,800 --> 02:06:36,440
And so we're going to do things- we're going to take steps to stop that.

2788
02:06:36,440 --> 02:06:39,960
And as we already have covered when Jesse Ventura was last on, he was talking about

2789
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:45,700
like, I'm not sure if these people are getting the programs that you say they are.

2790
02:06:45,700 --> 02:06:47,200
They're not because it's not possible.

2791
02:06:47,200 --> 02:06:48,200
Right.

2792
02:06:48,200 --> 02:06:52,280
But if they are, why would you not blame the system as opposed to the person who is just

2793
02:06:52,280 --> 02:06:53,280
trying to survive?

2794
02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:54,280
Exactly.

2795
02:06:54,280 --> 02:06:56,400
And that is a far more reasonable stance.

2796
02:06:56,400 --> 02:07:00,600
But Joe Biggs is coming in here and Trump is saying he's going to get rid of all the

2797
02:07:00,600 --> 02:07:01,600
illegal immigrants.

2798
02:07:01,600 --> 02:07:05,760
And he's like, that's impossible without turning into a fucking police state.

2799
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:06,760
Probably not.

2800
02:07:06,760 --> 02:07:08,760
Which would require some sort of tyranny.

2801
02:07:08,760 --> 02:07:09,760
Yeah.

2802
02:07:09,760 --> 02:07:13,040
Joe Biggs is pushing back against that and Alex is fine with the push.

2803
02:07:13,040 --> 02:07:14,440
It's crazy.

2804
02:07:14,440 --> 02:07:20,280
This next clip- Do we just diverge entirely from that?

2805
02:07:20,280 --> 02:07:21,440
No, not yet.

2806
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:22,440
No, not yet?

2807
02:07:22,440 --> 02:07:23,440
What's happening?

2808
02:07:23,440 --> 02:07:26,440
This next clip is still sensible.

2809
02:07:26,440 --> 02:07:28,040
We're not even critics of Trump here.

2810
02:07:28,040 --> 02:07:30,880
I mean, Joe just wanted to see what he was really like.

2811
02:07:30,880 --> 02:07:37,160
Yeah, but a lot of it is like a Rodney Dangerfield one liner.

2812
02:07:37,160 --> 02:07:39,080
Why do folks like him so much then?

2813
02:07:39,080 --> 02:07:40,080
He's a crowd pleaser.

2814
02:07:40,080 --> 02:07:43,000
He definitely knows how to work a crowd and that's what he was doing.

2815
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:46,160
He didn't have, the first thing he talked about when he showed up, hey, this is teleprompter

2816
02:07:46,160 --> 02:07:47,160
free.

2817
02:07:47,160 --> 02:07:48,160
We don't have any.

2818
02:07:48,160 --> 02:07:51,920
And he rambled on about how you made $215 million on The Apprentice.

2819
02:07:51,920 --> 02:07:54,560
It took 30 minutes before he even named an issue.

2820
02:07:54,560 --> 02:07:59,480
And when he did, he talked about this vague tax plan that he had and that in a few weeks

2821
02:07:59,480 --> 02:08:02,720
he's going to release this- Sure, he appealed like a carnival barker

2822
02:08:02,720 --> 02:08:03,720
to success.

2823
02:08:03,720 --> 02:08:08,920
But everyone was in there screaming and yelling, women crying, babies screaming, signs flying

2824
02:08:08,920 --> 02:08:09,920
up through the air.

2825
02:08:09,920 --> 02:08:11,400
Well that just shows how desperate people are.

2826
02:08:11,400 --> 02:08:15,760
So basically he's just saying there's no substance to what he's saying.

2827
02:08:15,760 --> 02:08:18,720
He's a showman, he's a carnival barker.

2828
02:08:18,720 --> 02:08:23,360
But at the end there, they're talking about how even with that lack of substance, people

2829
02:08:23,360 --> 02:08:25,380
are going crazy.

2830
02:08:25,380 --> 02:08:30,220
They were in an arena that was full of people.

2831
02:08:30,220 --> 02:08:36,160
Trump is able to draw these crowds, these massive crowds, that are mind blowing.

2832
02:08:36,160 --> 02:08:38,720
Oh, he would be booked at the improv immediately.

2833
02:08:38,720 --> 02:08:39,720
Totally.

2834
02:08:39,720 --> 02:08:40,720
He could do a set.

2835
02:08:40,720 --> 02:08:41,720
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

2836
02:08:41,720 --> 02:08:42,720
He's like Steve-O.

2837
02:08:42,720 --> 02:08:43,720
He's terrible, but fuck it.

2838
02:08:43,720 --> 02:08:44,720
Yeah, he can get a weekend.

2839
02:08:44,720 --> 02:08:45,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

2840
02:08:45,720 --> 02:08:46,720
Trump's stapling his balls to his leg.

2841
02:08:46,720 --> 02:08:49,240
Now I'd pay for that.

2842
02:08:49,240 --> 02:08:50,480
Yeah, well.

2843
02:08:50,480 --> 02:08:54,280
So I think that this is sort of- I would pay for me stapling Trump's balls

2844
02:08:54,280 --> 02:08:55,280
to his leg.

2845
02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:56,280
Yeah, you need to do it.

2846
02:08:56,280 --> 02:08:57,280
That's weird.

2847
02:08:57,280 --> 02:08:58,280
Oh, I need to do it.

2848
02:08:58,280 --> 02:09:04,440
So this next clip, I think we've heard a lot of a very reasonable perspective that Joe

2849
02:09:04,440 --> 02:09:13,080
Biggs has from going to this Trump rally, but I think we're going to start to see here-

2850
02:09:13,080 --> 02:09:14,800
It's gonna start to deteriorate?

2851
02:09:14,800 --> 02:09:15,800
Well maybe-

2852
02:09:15,800 --> 02:09:17,320
This will be the beginning of the end?

2853
02:09:17,320 --> 02:09:18,320
Maybe.

2854
02:09:18,320 --> 02:09:21,240
And I'll make my point after this clip and the next one.

2855
02:09:21,240 --> 02:09:23,600
Also, do you know how great Todd Glass is?

2856
02:09:23,600 --> 02:09:24,600
It's hilarious.

2857
02:09:24,600 --> 02:09:29,760
I can't- any time you bring up Rodney Dangerfield now, I don't think of Rodney Dangerfield.

2858
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:37,080
I think of Todd Glass doing Mitch Hedberg jokes in Rodney Dangerfield's voice.

2859
02:09:37,080 --> 02:09:38,080
He's the best.

2860
02:09:38,080 --> 02:09:39,080
It's just amazing.

2861
02:09:39,080 --> 02:09:41,040
Anyway, not the best is this.

2862
02:09:41,040 --> 02:09:44,480
Well, I definitely had an agenda when I went up there as well.

2863
02:09:44,480 --> 02:09:48,640
I wore my Hillary for a prison 2016 t-shirt under my suit.

2864
02:09:48,640 --> 02:09:50,320
By the way, that's a best seller.

2865
02:09:50,320 --> 02:09:51,320
We have photos.

2866
02:09:51,320 --> 02:09:52,320
At least you sent me those photos, Joe.

2867
02:09:52,320 --> 02:09:54,360
Yeah, yeah, they should be all on my Twitter right now as well.

2868
02:09:54,360 --> 02:09:58,920
And I have footage of myself, I'm in the front row, I suck up to the front row, and I'm sitting

2869
02:09:58,920 --> 02:10:01,080
there, I'm kind of getting nervous a little bit, I was like, alright, I gotta do it, I

2870
02:10:01,080 --> 02:10:02,080
gotta do it.

2871
02:10:02,080 --> 02:10:05,640
And I undid my shirt like Superman, and you can see the Hillary for prison shirt, and

2872
02:10:05,640 --> 02:10:09,520
I jumped up and screamed right in a lull, like a little silence part, and I go, Hillary

2873
02:10:09,520 --> 02:10:10,520
for prison!

2874
02:10:10,520 --> 02:10:13,480
And Trump's like, yeah, Hillary, and he's like, pointing at me.

2875
02:10:13,480 --> 02:10:15,800
So if you guys have that clip, we can show it really quick.

2876
02:10:15,800 --> 02:10:16,800
Did not happen.

2877
02:10:16,800 --> 02:10:17,800
Oh, we have a video clip of that?

2878
02:10:17,800 --> 02:10:18,800
Yeah, yeah.

2879
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:19,800
Oh, I didn't even know we had that video clip.

2880
02:10:19,800 --> 02:10:20,800
I just gave it to Nico.

2881
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:21,800
Did that for real happen?

2882
02:10:21,800 --> 02:10:22,800
It did.

2883
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:23,800
It did.

2884
02:10:23,800 --> 02:10:32,720
And it was, uh, Trump is in the middle of saying something that the crowd likes, and

2885
02:10:32,720 --> 02:10:38,680
Joe Biggs rips his shirt open, and he's got Hillary for prison, he yells Hillary for prison,

2886
02:10:38,680 --> 02:10:42,040
and Trump is like, you know who's not surging in the polls?

2887
02:10:42,040 --> 02:10:43,040
Hillary.

2888
02:10:43,040 --> 02:10:44,040
And he's like, thank you.

2889
02:10:44,040 --> 02:10:45,640
And he just points over at Joe Biggs.

2890
02:10:45,640 --> 02:10:47,540
That's the extent of the interaction.

2891
02:10:47,540 --> 02:10:48,560
But hear me out on this.

2892
02:10:48,560 --> 02:10:52,960
So Joe Biggs has been jerking off for three years based on that, right?

2893
02:10:52,960 --> 02:10:56,440
Joe Biggs went there as a marketing possibility.

2894
02:10:56,440 --> 02:11:02,000
The idea of going there and finding out what's going on with Trump was secondary to the idea

2895
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,840
of field testing this Hillary for prison shirt.

2896
02:11:04,840 --> 02:11:10,320
So he goes there as a marketing opportunity because Trump has pulled an arena full of

2897
02:11:10,320 --> 02:11:14,460
people to Texas, which there might be audience crossover with.

2898
02:11:14,460 --> 02:11:19,040
So Joe Biggs goes down there, he does the Superman thing, and people seem to really

2899
02:11:19,040 --> 02:11:20,040
like it.

2900
02:11:20,040 --> 02:11:21,040
Now listen to this next clip.

2901
02:11:21,040 --> 02:11:22,040
Oh no.

2902
02:11:22,040 --> 02:11:25,840
So I opened up my shirt, and the entire crowd erupted.

2903
02:11:25,840 --> 02:11:29,680
And you could see these different reporters or a man gets standing ovation for showing

2904
02:11:29,680 --> 02:11:30,680
his Hillary for prison shirt.

2905
02:11:30,680 --> 02:11:33,720
And it got to a point where I just ended up pulling the blazer off in the top and just

2906
02:11:33,720 --> 02:11:34,720
had the shirt going.

2907
02:11:34,720 --> 02:11:37,960
And see, anybody could have done what you gotta love the fact you always went with great

2908
02:11:37,960 --> 02:11:38,960
ideas.

2909
02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:39,960
You're always making the news.

2910
02:11:39,960 --> 02:11:42,840
You're always making people, you know, linking to what we're doing.

2911
02:11:42,840 --> 02:11:43,840
Great job, Joe.

2912
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:46,280
Well, I'm telling you, I probably told the least.

2913
02:11:46,280 --> 02:11:48,040
This is probably, you know, nice.

2914
02:11:48,040 --> 02:11:53,040
Maybe a thousand people with Infowars was, I want to see the spike in the site last night

2915
02:11:53,040 --> 02:11:54,040
because people were all on their phone.

2916
02:11:54,040 --> 02:11:55,040
Where do I get that?

2917
02:11:55,040 --> 02:11:56,600
I was like, you gotta go to the Infowars store, man.

2918
02:11:56,600 --> 02:11:57,600
You're gonna love it.

2919
02:11:57,600 --> 02:12:00,040
So sorry about the sound on the clips from this episode.

2920
02:12:00,040 --> 02:12:02,240
It was just glitchy and there was nothing I could do about it.

2921
02:12:02,240 --> 02:12:07,180
But beyond that, I think that this is the moment.

2922
02:12:07,180 --> 02:12:08,180
This is it.

2923
02:12:08,180 --> 02:12:09,840
The Hillary for prison shirt.

2924
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:16,040
It's because of the potential sales of Hillary for prison shirts that they pull on the...

2925
02:12:16,040 --> 02:12:19,360
They don't say it there at all.

2926
02:12:19,360 --> 02:12:26,120
But I fucking love and hate how my perspective keeps changing based on the information that

2927
02:12:26,120 --> 02:12:27,400
we keep getting.

2928
02:12:27,400 --> 02:12:32,640
But I legitimately think that that moment for them is transformative.

2929
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:33,640
Holy fuck.

2930
02:12:33,640 --> 02:12:35,400
Because they realize this is a whole market we can tap into.

2931
02:12:35,400 --> 02:12:42,400
Your argument is Alex Jones loves Trump now because of t-shirt sales.

2932
02:12:42,400 --> 02:12:45,160
Well, even go beyond t-shirt sales.

2933
02:12:45,160 --> 02:12:48,200
It's a market, a fertile market that we can tap into.

2934
02:12:48,200 --> 02:12:51,520
Alex Jones couldn't get an arena of people to show up somewhere.

2935
02:12:51,520 --> 02:12:52,520
Of course not.

2936
02:12:52,520 --> 02:12:53,640
Trump shows up to town.

2937
02:12:53,640 --> 02:12:56,040
He's got a whole stadium full of people.

2938
02:12:56,040 --> 02:13:01,440
Joe Biggs comes in, charms them, does some like grifty door to door salesmanship with

2939
02:13:01,440 --> 02:13:02,440
their shirts.

2940
02:13:02,440 --> 02:13:04,000
I imagine behind the scenes they did...

2941
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:07,040
What do I need you to do to get you into a t-shirt today?

2942
02:13:07,040 --> 02:13:10,760
I imagine, I don't know this, but I imagine behind the scenes they saw a spike in traffic

2943
02:13:10,760 --> 02:13:11,960
to the site.

2944
02:13:11,960 --> 02:13:15,720
Everybody got a bunch of sales from it and they're like, this might be something we need

2945
02:13:15,720 --> 02:13:16,720
to do.

2946
02:13:16,720 --> 02:13:17,720
Wow.

2947
02:13:17,720 --> 02:13:18,720
So I think that...

2948
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:21,920
I mean, I think we always knew that there would be some sort of crass capitalism to

2949
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:22,920
it.

2950
02:13:22,920 --> 02:13:23,920
Totally.

2951
02:13:23,920 --> 02:13:25,800
But this is, this is too much, right?

2952
02:13:25,800 --> 02:13:27,600
Well, that's field testing it though.

2953
02:13:27,600 --> 02:13:28,600
Yeah.

2954
02:13:28,600 --> 02:13:29,600
That's taking it to the streets.

2955
02:13:29,600 --> 02:13:30,600
Taking it to the streets.

2956
02:13:30,600 --> 02:13:31,600
All right.

2957
02:13:31,600 --> 02:13:32,600
Quote the doobs.

2958
02:13:32,600 --> 02:13:33,600
All right.

2959
02:13:33,600 --> 02:13:34,600
We're done with that.

2960
02:13:34,600 --> 02:13:38,520
So that's where we leave off on the 15th.

2961
02:13:38,520 --> 02:13:42,120
There's a whole bunch of other dumb bullshit that happens on that show.

2962
02:13:42,120 --> 02:13:47,320
Alex Jones does reveal, he doesn't want to reveal it, but he does say that it costs him

2963
02:13:47,320 --> 02:13:51,880
over $15 million to run Infowars for a year.

2964
02:13:51,880 --> 02:13:52,880
Okay.

2965
02:13:52,880 --> 02:13:56,600
So if you take that number and you consider...

2966
02:13:56,600 --> 02:13:59,360
That seems, that seems honest.

2967
02:13:59,360 --> 02:14:01,280
That seems to make sense, right?

2968
02:14:01,280 --> 02:14:03,280
About $15 million makes sense.

2969
02:14:03,280 --> 02:14:08,500
Well, yeah, it's, it's in the realm of believable, especially considering he runs it out of

2970
02:14:08,500 --> 02:14:10,240
Texas and what have you, but...

2971
02:14:10,240 --> 02:14:11,960
Say he's exaggerating as always.

2972
02:14:11,960 --> 02:14:14,760
I would say $10 million does make sense though.

2973
02:14:14,760 --> 02:14:16,160
That's me in the middle at 12th.

2974
02:14:16,160 --> 02:14:18,960
But be that as it may, it doesn't matter.

2975
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:21,540
I'm glad you and I can come to a detente on this.

2976
02:14:21,540 --> 02:14:27,660
It doesn't really matter whether the number is 10 or 15, because the money bomb that we're

2977
02:14:27,660 --> 02:14:31,120
about to get into, because we're about to jump into the 16th, which is the beginning

2978
02:14:31,120 --> 02:14:35,080
of the money bomb, 28 hour live broadcast.

2979
02:14:35,080 --> 02:14:36,080
Jesus.

2980
02:14:36,080 --> 02:14:39,120
He doesn't, he's trying to make a million dollars.

2981
02:14:39,120 --> 02:14:40,120
Yeah.

2982
02:14:40,120 --> 02:14:41,120
So that...

2983
02:14:41,120 --> 02:14:42,960
Publicly, he's trying to make a million dollars.

2984
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:43,960
Right, but...

2985
02:14:43,960 --> 02:14:46,080
He's trying to make a certain amount of money.

2986
02:14:46,080 --> 02:14:47,080
Hopefully it's a million.

2987
02:14:47,080 --> 02:14:48,080
Right.

2988
02:14:48,080 --> 02:14:53,960
But all of the things that he says he wants to do with that million dollars is weird hypothetical

2989
02:14:53,960 --> 02:14:59,040
stuff about shooting the show into Europe, which he said, which he said already, I'm

2990
02:14:59,040 --> 02:15:00,720
not, we are not going to do that immediately.

2991
02:15:00,720 --> 02:15:03,040
We're going to get the satellites, blah, blah, blah.

2992
02:15:03,040 --> 02:15:04,040
Of course not.

2993
02:15:04,040 --> 02:15:10,520
The best of it is stuff he's already doing, paying for reporters, paying for cameras,

2994
02:15:10,520 --> 02:15:14,880
paying for syndication, paying for closed captioning.

2995
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:17,120
He's doing all of that already.

2996
02:15:17,120 --> 02:15:22,640
So all of that million dollars is just operating expenses that he already has accrued.

2997
02:15:22,640 --> 02:15:28,320
The idea that he needs this million dollars for future stuff is absurd.

2998
02:15:28,320 --> 02:15:33,840
If you watch, I watch them, because these are, I watch this shit on YouTube, his studio

2999
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:36,320
looks exactly the same as it does now.

3000
02:15:36,320 --> 02:15:44,360
There's no, from 2015 to 2017, there is no discernible change that has been made in terms

3001
02:15:44,360 --> 02:15:45,680
of the studio.

3002
02:15:45,680 --> 02:15:47,320
Yeah, but there's upkeep.

3003
02:15:47,320 --> 02:15:51,560
There are no people who are there that aren't...

3004
02:15:51,560 --> 02:15:52,560
Rappaport.

3005
02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:54,360
No, fuck off.

3006
02:15:54,360 --> 02:15:55,360
Rappaport works for free.

3007
02:15:55,360 --> 02:15:57,360
Rappaport probably does work for free.

3008
02:15:57,360 --> 02:15:58,360
Rappaport's a soldier.

3009
02:15:58,360 --> 02:16:01,360
Rappaport probably does work for free.

3010
02:16:01,360 --> 02:16:06,740
But hear me out, the way I wanted to end that sentence is there isn't a greater number of

3011
02:16:06,740 --> 02:16:10,600
people that work there that aren't balanced out by the less number of people who have

3012
02:16:10,600 --> 02:16:13,200
quit since this change happened.

3013
02:16:13,200 --> 02:16:19,160
So there isn't really like a wide expansion that has happened.

3014
02:16:19,160 --> 02:16:24,560
He's pretended that an expansion in his audience has happened, but if you look at these statistics

3015
02:16:24,560 --> 02:16:30,080
that are available on Quantcast and other tracking sources, that hasn't happened.

3016
02:16:30,080 --> 02:16:33,420
If you look at the numbers that are on his YouTube videos even, they aren't what he says

3017
02:16:33,420 --> 02:16:34,420
they are.

3018
02:16:34,420 --> 02:16:38,120
Unless you add all of them up and assume that all of them are different people.

3019
02:16:38,120 --> 02:16:44,160
But be that as it may, he's trying to raise money for a fictitious thing that didn't happen.

3020
02:16:44,160 --> 02:16:48,800
Yeah, now I understand your point.

3021
02:16:48,800 --> 02:16:57,180
To me though, it seems like it's exactly the same thing as an NPR, like, hey, we do live

3022
02:16:57,180 --> 02:17:00,800
entirely upon public money.

3023
02:17:00,800 --> 02:17:08,800
But because he can't supplicate himself, because he can't be somebody who asks for operating

3024
02:17:08,800 --> 02:17:11,120
costs, he has to say it this way.

3025
02:17:11,120 --> 02:17:12,120
It's possible.

3026
02:17:12,120 --> 02:17:13,120
So to me, it's a-

3027
02:17:13,120 --> 02:17:15,720
Like a hyper-masculine NPR?

3028
02:17:15,720 --> 02:17:16,720
It's a fundraiser.

3029
02:17:16,720 --> 02:17:18,820
It's a hyper-masculine fundraiser.

3030
02:17:18,820 --> 02:17:21,280
That's what it seems like to me so far.

3031
02:17:21,280 --> 02:17:22,280
Right.

3032
02:17:22,280 --> 02:17:27,640
So basically, NPR is not going to go hypothetically out of business if they don't make the money

3033
02:17:27,640 --> 02:17:29,040
by the end of the year.

3034
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:30,040
True.

3035
02:17:30,040 --> 02:17:31,440
And I feel the panic in Alex.

3036
02:17:31,440 --> 02:17:34,840
I don't think he's going to go out of business, he would have to downsize.

3037
02:17:34,840 --> 02:17:36,640
Reduce his standard of living.

3038
02:17:36,640 --> 02:17:38,240
Yeah, exactly.

3039
02:17:38,240 --> 02:17:41,680
The reason that it strikes me as false, and I understand what you're saying, and I think

3040
02:17:41,680 --> 02:17:43,400
there is a kernel of it.

3041
02:17:43,400 --> 02:17:50,840
Because I know that it's easy for us to give a pass to NPR, because we're bougie-ass liberals,

3042
02:17:50,840 --> 02:17:54,200
and be like, hey, Alex is trying to raise money, what a dumbass.

3043
02:17:54,200 --> 02:17:55,840
And that's what he would think we're doing.

3044
02:17:55,840 --> 02:17:59,880
Which, by the way, you can donate to Knowledge Fight if you go to the Knowledge Fight website

3045
02:17:59,880 --> 02:18:00,960
and click on our link.

3046
02:18:00,960 --> 02:18:01,960
Thank you to all the policy wonks.

3047
02:18:01,960 --> 02:18:02,960
But that's not-

3048
02:18:02,960 --> 02:18:04,720
No, for real, thank you to all the policy wonks.

3049
02:18:04,720 --> 02:18:07,000
That's not at all what I'm getting at.

3050
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:14,780
The circumstances of it are much more interesting, because he's presenting a fictitious expansion

3051
02:18:14,780 --> 02:18:16,000
of the show.

3052
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:17,000
So that's one.

3053
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:18,000
Right.

3054
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:21,840
He's saying it at the end of the fiscal year, which is two.

3055
02:18:21,840 --> 02:18:28,000
And then the third is he's in this will-they-won't-they situation with Trump that is super fucked

3056
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:29,400
up.

3057
02:18:29,400 --> 02:18:31,600
That's the thing I think we're talking about.

3058
02:18:31,600 --> 02:18:34,960
It's not about that he needs money.

3059
02:18:34,960 --> 02:18:41,700
It's that because he needs money, there is motive there in order to make the pivot.

3060
02:18:41,700 --> 02:18:43,000
That's what we're talking about.

3061
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:50,640
And NPR is never going to do a fundraiser and then stealth vote for a candidate because

3062
02:18:50,640 --> 02:18:51,640
of it.

3063
02:18:51,640 --> 02:18:52,640
No.

3064
02:18:52,640 --> 02:19:00,520
Legitimate news sources don't have-they aren't doing subversive marketing.

3065
02:19:00,520 --> 02:19:08,520
The Guardian is now saying, hey, journalism needs to be paid for.

3066
02:19:08,520 --> 02:19:13,920
And rather than put us behind a paywall, we need you to donate to it, or we'd like it

3067
02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:16,200
if you donated to it.

3068
02:19:16,200 --> 02:19:23,920
At no point would the Guardian all of a sudden become the fucking Daily Mail because Trump

3069
02:19:23,920 --> 02:19:26,480
gave them-well, at least we would hope not.

3070
02:19:26,480 --> 02:19:27,680
I would hope not.

3071
02:19:27,680 --> 02:19:30,680
Because Trump gave them ten million dollars or whatever.

3072
02:19:30,680 --> 02:19:38,920
Ultimately I believe that there is probably a future better civilization that involves

3073
02:19:38,920 --> 02:19:46,360
all public financing for presidential campaigns, political campaigns, and journalism.

3074
02:19:46,360 --> 02:19:49,880
Public financing for campaigns and journalism does make a lot of sense.

3075
02:19:49,880 --> 02:19:52,480
Those sorts of things need to be incredibly unbiased.

3076
02:19:52,480 --> 02:19:58,440
And it's impossible to have no bias, like we fucking hate Alex Jones and we hate Trump.

3077
02:19:58,440 --> 02:20:01,840
But at the same time- Whoa, I'm unbiased about Trump.

3078
02:20:01,840 --> 02:20:07,640
I think you can go back and look at my previous statements and note that I have no bias.

3079
02:20:07,640 --> 02:20:12,040
Our bias is incredibly clear, but at the same time when Alex Jones has said stuff that's

3080
02:20:12,040 --> 02:20:16,600
like yeah, rock and roll, we've been totally cool with it.

3081
02:20:16,600 --> 02:20:20,240
We don't hate him in such a way that we will never give him props.

3082
02:20:20,240 --> 02:20:25,520
Also Alex, you really need to look into what Jeff Sessions is doing with civil asset forfeiture.

3083
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:26,520
Oh my god.

3084
02:20:26,520 --> 02:20:28,600
So far, no comment on that that I've seen.

3085
02:20:28,600 --> 02:20:29,600
Unbelievable.

3086
02:20:29,600 --> 02:20:30,840
He might have talked about it and I missed it.

3087
02:20:30,840 --> 02:20:31,900
If it did, I apologize.

3088
02:20:31,900 --> 02:20:37,560
So if Sessions did or didn't commit a crime- He did, he did.

3089
02:20:37,560 --> 02:20:44,760
Because he's under investigation for it, don't we get to take his stuff by his own rules?

3090
02:20:44,760 --> 02:20:45,760
That's a great point.

3091
02:20:45,760 --> 02:20:47,120
Don't we get to steal his stuff?

3092
02:20:47,120 --> 02:20:48,760
You gotta steal those assets.

3093
02:20:48,760 --> 02:20:50,480
I want to seize his assets.

3094
02:20:50,480 --> 02:20:53,160
So- Can we make a citizen's civil forfeiture?

3095
02:20:53,160 --> 02:20:55,520
That would be great.

3096
02:20:55,520 --> 02:20:57,800
I would just like to take maybe 60 bucks from him.

3097
02:20:57,800 --> 02:20:58,800
Oh, absolutely.

3098
02:20:58,800 --> 02:21:01,220
Help me get to the end of the month.

3099
02:21:01,220 --> 02:21:12,640
So speaking of things that have to do with money, Jordan, it is time for the money bomb!

3100
02:21:12,640 --> 02:21:13,640
Here's the bad news.

3101
02:21:13,640 --> 02:21:14,640
The money bomb?

3102
02:21:14,640 --> 02:21:15,640
Let's edit that out.

3103
02:21:15,640 --> 02:21:17,360
Let's edit out our- Oh, that's staying in.

3104
02:21:17,360 --> 02:21:18,360
That's staying in.

3105
02:21:18,360 --> 02:21:19,360
Don't worry.

3106
02:21:19,360 --> 02:21:20,360
All right.

3107
02:21:20,360 --> 02:21:24,020
That, the money bomb, is incredibly boring.

3108
02:21:24,020 --> 02:21:25,280
Of course it is.

3109
02:21:25,280 --> 02:21:27,640
27 hours or whatever the fuck it was?

3110
02:21:27,640 --> 02:21:30,840
I didn't watch any of it that didn't have Alex Jones on it.

3111
02:21:30,840 --> 02:21:31,840
Smart.

3112
02:21:31,840 --> 02:21:37,120
But there is one piece that I wish I had watched, that I didn't watch, and I won't.

3113
02:21:37,120 --> 02:21:38,440
Because why would I do that?

3114
02:21:38,440 --> 02:21:39,640
Why would I put myself through it?

3115
02:21:39,640 --> 02:21:42,740
Yeah, you've already hurt yourself enough on our behalf.

3116
02:21:42,740 --> 02:21:46,760
Here's something that we didn't realize about the money bomb.

3117
02:21:46,760 --> 02:21:49,300
It is at the end of the fiscal year.

3118
02:21:49,300 --> 02:21:52,000
But do you know what else happened on September 16th?

3119
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:53,000
No!

3120
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:56,160
The second Republican presidential debate.

3121
02:21:56,160 --> 02:21:57,160
Ooooh.

3122
02:21:57,160 --> 02:22:00,560
So they timed it to be on the night of the debate.

3123
02:22:00,560 --> 02:22:02,480
Oh shit, that's really smart.

3124
02:22:02,480 --> 02:22:03,480
Yeah.

3125
02:22:03,480 --> 02:22:04,480
That's really smart of them.

3126
02:22:04,480 --> 02:22:05,480
Yeah.

3127
02:22:05,480 --> 02:22:06,480
You gotta give them credit for that.

3128
02:22:06,480 --> 02:22:07,480
That's brilliant.

3129
02:22:07,480 --> 02:22:11,760
So during the debate, what they did is Leanne McAdoo, David Knight, and I think Rob Doo?

3130
02:22:11,760 --> 02:22:13,560
I can't remember the third person.

3131
02:22:13,560 --> 02:22:18,320
But they had a panel that Mystery Science Theatered the debate.

3132
02:22:18,320 --> 02:22:21,440
So what they did is they had their silhouettes on the desk.

3133
02:22:21,440 --> 02:22:22,440
No shit.

3134
02:22:22,440 --> 02:22:24,760
All on the backs of their heads.

3135
02:22:24,760 --> 02:22:25,760
Wow.

3136
02:22:25,760 --> 02:22:26,760
Fucking wow.

3137
02:22:26,760 --> 02:22:30,280
And I saw a couple clips of it and it's lunacy.

3138
02:22:30,280 --> 02:22:33,560
They didn't even hire Mike Nelson for like a day?

3139
02:22:33,560 --> 02:22:34,560
Nothin'.

3140
02:22:34,560 --> 02:22:36,480
No, no professionals on this.

3141
02:22:36,480 --> 02:22:37,880
No fake robot either.

3142
02:22:37,880 --> 02:22:42,360
Like you could, Alex, it would be so easy to just create a robot to put in there.

3143
02:22:42,360 --> 02:22:43,960
You could get even probably the real gypsy.

3144
02:22:43,960 --> 02:22:44,960
Who cares?

3145
02:22:44,960 --> 02:22:45,960
Oh, yeah.

3146
02:22:45,960 --> 02:22:46,960
He hates gypsies though.

3147
02:22:46,960 --> 02:22:47,960
I should be good about that.

3148
02:22:47,960 --> 02:22:48,960
Alright.

3149
02:22:48,960 --> 02:22:49,960
I don't like even using the word gypsy.

3150
02:22:49,960 --> 02:22:54,520
On October 10th he did talk about how the gypsies have free reign to steal RVs in Europe.

3151
02:22:54,520 --> 02:22:55,520
Nope.

3152
02:22:55,520 --> 02:22:56,520
Nope.

3153
02:22:56,520 --> 02:22:57,520
Nope.

3154
02:22:57,520 --> 02:22:58,520
Yep.

3155
02:22:58,520 --> 02:23:01,640
That's a fucking racist thing from the 1700s.

3156
02:23:01,640 --> 02:23:03,520
What are you doing talking about gypsies?

3157
02:23:03,520 --> 02:23:04,520
It's wild.

3158
02:23:04,520 --> 02:23:12,760
So the schedule of the 27 hour, 28 hour broadcast was really disappointing.

3159
02:23:12,760 --> 02:23:16,960
They had that, you know, Mystery Science Theater, blah blah.

3160
02:23:16,960 --> 02:23:22,280
They had Alex Jones for his show on the beginning of it on the 16th.

3161
02:23:22,280 --> 02:23:25,360
The Alex Jones show on the 17th.

3162
02:23:25,360 --> 02:23:32,520
Beyond that it was just like, they're reporters, tag teamed, like Kit Daniels did a show.

3163
02:23:32,520 --> 02:23:33,520
Never heard Kit Daniels name.

3164
02:23:33,520 --> 02:23:34,520
He's a writer.

3165
02:23:34,520 --> 02:23:35,520
He's a writer guy.

3166
02:23:35,520 --> 02:23:38,000
He's not really on air all that much.

3167
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:39,000
Some of these...

3168
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,160
That always goes well when you put a writer guy on air.

3169
02:23:41,160 --> 02:23:47,320
Some of these other guys, like just people, Rob Doo interviewed Leo Zagami, the Illuminati

3170
02:23:47,320 --> 02:23:49,560
insider who hates the Pope.

3171
02:23:49,560 --> 02:23:51,560
They did that at midnight.

3172
02:23:51,560 --> 02:23:52,560
Not at midnight.

3173
02:23:52,560 --> 02:23:53,680
That was like 2am.

3174
02:23:53,680 --> 02:23:55,560
It was just nonsense.

3175
02:23:55,560 --> 02:24:00,600
They had fucking Paul Joseph Watson doing a bunch of stuff on the off hours because

3176
02:24:00,600 --> 02:24:02,160
he's on Greenwich Mean Time.

3177
02:24:02,160 --> 02:24:06,880
So it's, again, you're doing an overnight thing where no one has to stay up overnight

3178
02:24:06,880 --> 02:24:08,520
except for Rob Doo.

3179
02:24:08,520 --> 02:24:10,120
But be that as it may.

3180
02:24:10,120 --> 02:24:15,840
Look, Rob Doo is kind of our tortured slave of Infowars here.

3181
02:24:15,840 --> 02:24:19,840
I start to like him more and more as time goes on and I'm not comfortable with that.

3182
02:24:19,840 --> 02:24:21,200
He's kind of, to me...

3183
02:24:21,200 --> 02:24:22,200
He's an everyman.

3184
02:24:22,200 --> 02:24:28,120
He's kind of a Charlie Brown, like there's the football right there and Rob Doo is about

3185
02:24:28,120 --> 02:24:30,440
to kick it and it is always pulled out from underneath him.

3186
02:24:30,440 --> 02:24:35,660
I think behind the scenes he's probably way worse than he appears because he just seems

3187
02:24:35,660 --> 02:24:36,660
so boring.

3188
02:24:36,660 --> 02:24:38,240
I bet behind the scenes he's a dick.

3189
02:24:38,240 --> 02:24:39,240
Probably.

3190
02:24:39,240 --> 02:24:41,640
He's been able to stay in this business for like years.

3191
02:24:41,640 --> 02:24:42,960
That's a really good point.

3192
02:24:42,960 --> 02:24:44,960
Unless he's Renfield.

3193
02:24:44,960 --> 02:24:48,000
Have you considered that he is actually mind controlled by Alex Jones?

3194
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:51,800
No, because I don't consider those sorts of things because they're lunatic.

3195
02:24:51,800 --> 02:24:56,400
I think there's a decent chance there's a good person behind Rob Doo and that sucks

3196
02:24:56,400 --> 02:24:57,860
because he's so fucking boring.

3197
02:24:57,860 --> 02:25:02,040
But be that as it may, what we're going to be talking about is specifically and only

3198
02:25:02,040 --> 02:25:05,860
the Alex Jones portions of the Money Bomb.

3199
02:25:05,860 --> 02:25:10,680
So we're going to start with the 16th, Alex Jones wants to talk to you about his audience

3200
02:25:10,680 --> 02:25:11,680
size.

3201
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:12,680
Oh boy.

3202
02:25:12,680 --> 02:25:13,840
I bet it's pretty big.

3203
02:25:13,840 --> 02:25:17,920
They brought in the metrics to my house last night, Buckley Hammond and Anthony Gucciardi

3204
02:25:17,920 --> 02:25:23,040
that I have working with outside IT consulting firms and they said you're giving people two

3205
02:25:23,040 --> 02:25:24,920
year old numbers, here they are.

3206
02:25:24,920 --> 02:25:29,800
They pulled them up in front of me on all the big third party sites and our own internal

3207
02:25:29,800 --> 02:25:30,920
server systems.

3208
02:25:30,920 --> 02:25:35,000
Info Wars now reaches 41 million individual different people a month.

3209
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:43,000
It has a reach of 1.4 billion total views on the website.

3210
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:49,520
If you count all of our social media, it is several billion more individual users.

3211
02:25:49,520 --> 02:25:54,180
We did a metric run with a major company and looked at our YouTube views just on the top

3212
02:25:54,180 --> 02:26:01,040
500 sites carrying our videos and it's over 150 million views a month and so they're now

3213
02:26:01,040 --> 02:26:06,420
collating all of that data we'll be releasing soon, but it appears we're reaching upwards

3214
02:26:06,420 --> 02:26:10,480
of three and a half billion individual people per month.

3215
02:26:10,480 --> 02:26:17,000
There is six billion people that have some access to the internet, some access three

3216
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:18,000
and a half.

3217
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,800
How many people even live on the planet in your world?

3218
02:26:20,800 --> 02:26:21,800
It's insane.

3219
02:26:21,800 --> 02:26:22,800
What?

3220
02:26:22,800 --> 02:26:23,800
What?

3221
02:26:23,800 --> 02:26:25,280
In full disclosure.

3222
02:26:25,280 --> 02:26:31,280
So six out of the seven billion people on this fucking planet have internet access.

3223
02:26:31,280 --> 02:26:32,320
Which isn't true at all.

3224
02:26:32,320 --> 02:26:34,440
That's not even close to true.

3225
02:26:34,440 --> 02:26:35,440
No.

3226
02:26:35,440 --> 02:26:40,400
Three point two, three point, between three point two and three point six billion have

3227
02:26:40,400 --> 02:26:41,400
internet.

3228
02:26:41,400 --> 02:26:42,400
Oh, okay.

3229
02:26:42,400 --> 02:26:47,240
Well then all of them, all of them are Alex Jones listeners.

3230
02:26:47,240 --> 02:26:52,240
Here's something that's very interesting, 700 billion of those people who have internet

3231
02:26:52,240 --> 02:26:53,240
access.

3232
02:26:53,240 --> 02:26:54,240
700 million of those people.

3233
02:26:54,240 --> 02:26:55,240
I'm sorry.

3234
02:26:55,240 --> 02:26:57,200
700 million of those people live in China.

3235
02:26:57,200 --> 02:26:59,120
None of them have access to Infowars.

3236
02:26:59,120 --> 02:27:00,460
Oh, that's right.

3237
02:27:00,460 --> 02:27:02,120
They don't even have access to it.

3238
02:27:02,120 --> 02:27:03,120
No way.

3239
02:27:03,120 --> 02:27:04,120
It's censored.

3240
02:27:04,120 --> 02:27:05,120
That's almost.

3241
02:27:05,120 --> 02:27:06,120
Holy shit.

3242
02:27:06,120 --> 02:27:09,680
That's almost a billion of the people who have access to the internet, who have a censored

3243
02:27:09,680 --> 02:27:10,680
internet.

3244
02:27:10,680 --> 02:27:14,200
Alex Jones spends all of his time talking about the chai comms and shit.

3245
02:27:14,200 --> 02:27:15,200
There's no way they can do the filter.

3246
02:27:15,200 --> 02:27:17,600
Yeah, there's no way they can watch, no shit.

3247
02:27:17,600 --> 02:27:18,600
Of course not.

3248
02:27:18,600 --> 02:27:20,180
So that's 700 million of them.

3249
02:27:20,180 --> 02:27:22,200
Now it's literally impossible.

3250
02:27:22,200 --> 02:27:27,360
Well that covers, so he said there's six billion listening to him, right?

3251
02:27:27,360 --> 02:27:30,240
So that 700 million covers the extra billion.

3252
02:27:30,240 --> 02:27:33,840
No, no, because he's talking about the people who have access to the internet.

3253
02:27:33,840 --> 02:27:34,840
Oh, that's right.

3254
02:27:34,840 --> 02:27:39,160
It's only three and a half million who actually listen, or three and a half billion who actually

3255
02:27:39,160 --> 02:27:40,160
listen to him.

3256
02:27:40,160 --> 02:27:41,160
No, no, no.

3257
02:27:41,160 --> 02:27:42,160
He's saying that they reach.

3258
02:27:42,160 --> 02:27:43,160
They reach.

3259
02:27:43,160 --> 02:27:44,720
What does that even fucking mean?

3260
02:27:44,720 --> 02:27:47,800
It's bullshit internet social media nonsense.

3261
02:27:47,800 --> 02:27:52,800
It's the same reason he says that Paul Joseph Watson's videos have millions of views.

3262
02:27:52,800 --> 02:27:57,640
It's because they post them on Facebook, and people scroll past it, it auto plays, and

3263
02:27:57,640 --> 02:27:59,320
that counts as a play.

3264
02:27:59,320 --> 02:28:00,320
It's the same-

3265
02:28:00,320 --> 02:28:01,320
Is that real?

3266
02:28:01,320 --> 02:28:02,320
Yeah.

3267
02:28:02,320 --> 02:28:03,320
That actually counts as a play?

3268
02:28:03,320 --> 02:28:04,320
Yeah.

3269
02:28:04,320 --> 02:28:06,800
You look at all these nonsense videos that no one's watching, like ad videos, and it

3270
02:28:06,800 --> 02:28:08,520
says like two million-

3271
02:28:08,520 --> 02:28:11,440
I haven't been on Facebook for a good year.

3272
02:28:11,440 --> 02:28:17,160
I remember this from back when I was trolling around on that dumb site.

3273
02:28:17,160 --> 02:28:22,240
Looking up old girlfriends.

3274
02:28:22,240 --> 02:28:29,880
That's what most people do, but also we really, really have to point out he's double, triple,

3275
02:28:29,880 --> 02:28:31,700
and quadruple counting shit.

3276
02:28:31,700 --> 02:28:36,820
There's absolutely no way, because he's talking about the top 100 sites that post our videos.

3277
02:28:36,820 --> 02:28:40,440
Which we've already established is he's at like what?

3278
02:28:40,440 --> 02:28:42,280
He's not even in the top 200?

3279
02:28:42,280 --> 02:28:43,280
No, no, no.

3280
02:28:43,280 --> 02:28:44,840
He's talking about the places that post his-

3281
02:28:44,840 --> 02:28:45,840
Oh, okay.

3282
02:28:45,840 --> 02:28:46,840
Okay, okay.

3283
02:28:46,840 --> 02:28:49,800
Do you understand how YouTube's analytics work?

3284
02:28:49,800 --> 02:28:50,800
Yes.

3285
02:28:50,800 --> 02:28:55,320
Well, I mean no, but as you've explained them to me in regards to Alex Jonesy, yes.

3286
02:28:55,320 --> 02:29:02,600
If you embed a video on your blog, let's say, from YouTube, and someone plays it from the

3287
02:29:02,600 --> 02:29:07,200
blog, it counts as a hit on YouTube.

3288
02:29:07,200 --> 02:29:14,840
But if there is this blog post that is about your video, you can count that as another

3289
02:29:14,840 --> 02:29:15,840
hit.

3290
02:29:15,840 --> 02:29:20,360
So it's two hits for every single person who does either.

3291
02:29:20,360 --> 02:29:21,360
Right.

3292
02:29:21,360 --> 02:29:24,040
So you've already doubled your hits even though it's only one view.

3293
02:29:24,040 --> 02:29:27,160
Yeah, and Alex Jones is doing that all over the fucking place.

3294
02:29:27,160 --> 02:29:33,480
So if there's like five websites, all of them you read because you're an avid info warrior.

3295
02:29:33,480 --> 02:29:34,840
Right, and there's probably like-

3296
02:29:34,840 --> 02:29:35,960
You get 10 views.

3297
02:29:35,960 --> 02:29:39,360
WorldNetDaily reposts their stuff.

3298
02:29:39,360 --> 02:29:45,840
Breitbart has in the past reposted their links and their videos.

3299
02:29:45,840 --> 02:29:50,800
Well, just with the emails Trump has sent out to all of his donors with Info Wars links

3300
02:29:50,800 --> 02:29:51,800
on it.

3301
02:29:51,800 --> 02:29:55,240
And he's actually, like in that link, there was a video embedded.

3302
02:29:55,240 --> 02:29:56,480
Yeah, of course.

3303
02:29:56,480 --> 02:29:58,440
So that counts.

3304
02:29:58,440 --> 02:29:59,920
That counts double.

3305
02:29:59,920 --> 02:30:04,720
There's massive manipulation going on there in terms of the audience size, and that is

3306
02:30:04,720 --> 02:30:07,200
exactly how you want to start the Money Bomb.

3307
02:30:07,200 --> 02:30:08,200
Of course.

3308
02:30:08,200 --> 02:30:09,200
That's how you want to start it.

3309
02:30:09,200 --> 02:30:13,960
We're reaching 3.5 billion people a month.

3310
02:30:13,960 --> 02:30:17,200
That's everyone in the world, because consider it.

3311
02:30:17,200 --> 02:30:19,440
Think about how many children there are.

3312
02:30:19,440 --> 02:30:20,780
You know what I'm saying?

3313
02:30:20,780 --> 02:30:25,420
We talk about there being seven billion people, seven and a half billion people in the world.

3314
02:30:25,420 --> 02:30:27,120
How many of those people are under 12?

3315
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:29,920
Most of them are dying and most of them are just born.

3316
02:30:29,920 --> 02:30:30,920
Yeah.

3317
02:30:30,920 --> 02:30:33,800
So 3.5 billion is every adult basically.

3318
02:30:33,800 --> 02:30:35,660
Yeah, that is basic.

3319
02:30:35,660 --> 02:30:37,440
That's more than every adult.

3320
02:30:37,440 --> 02:30:38,440
Basically.

3321
02:30:38,440 --> 02:30:39,440
Wow.

3322
02:30:39,440 --> 02:30:42,520
And then you consider the amount of people who have no internet access, you consider

3323
02:30:42,520 --> 02:30:46,240
the Chinese, and they're not the only country that restricts the internet.

3324
02:30:46,240 --> 02:30:47,240
No, of course not.

3325
02:30:47,240 --> 02:30:50,280
So you have other countries that have blocked internet, and you consider that-

3326
02:30:50,280 --> 02:30:51,280
Saudi Arabia.

3327
02:30:51,280 --> 02:30:52,280
Absolutely.

3328
02:30:52,280 --> 02:30:53,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3329
02:30:53,280 --> 02:30:55,480
You consider those populations, his numbers make no fucking sense.

3330
02:30:55,480 --> 02:30:56,880
His best way of trying to-

3331
02:30:56,880 --> 02:30:59,160
At best, he's reaching 10 guys.

3332
02:30:59,160 --> 02:31:00,160
Yeah.

3333
02:31:00,160 --> 02:31:02,160
And one of them's me.

3334
02:31:02,160 --> 02:31:03,160
Yeah.

3335
02:31:03,160 --> 02:31:04,160
So you're down 10%.

3336
02:31:04,160 --> 02:31:05,160
Exactly.

3337
02:31:05,160 --> 02:31:06,160
Yeah.

3338
02:31:06,160 --> 02:31:10,800
And he tries to sort of like couch it and he's like, now maybe people are coming to

3339
02:31:10,800 --> 02:31:15,840
our site from different devices, so maybe we're reaching a billion a month.

3340
02:31:15,840 --> 02:31:16,840
So would you-

3341
02:31:16,840 --> 02:31:17,840
And even that's crazy.

3342
02:31:17,840 --> 02:31:23,820
So wait, so if you check your Facebook on your computer, and then you check your Facebook

3343
02:31:23,820 --> 02:31:26,760
on your phone, that counts as a different view.

3344
02:31:26,760 --> 02:31:32,200
Well, I think if you track IP addresses, yeah, I think that is the case.

3345
02:31:32,200 --> 02:31:36,120
Especially if you're using mobile, like if you're on the bus and you check your Facebook,

3346
02:31:36,120 --> 02:31:38,360
it would be different than you checking it on your laptop at home.

3347
02:31:38,360 --> 02:31:40,400
So that's multiple views on top of that.

3348
02:31:40,400 --> 02:31:41,400
Yeah.

3349
02:31:41,400 --> 02:31:46,400
And it makes it incredibly difficult to tell exactly what your metrics are, unless you

3350
02:31:46,400 --> 02:31:47,400
have-

3351
02:31:47,400 --> 02:31:48,680
Not sort of-

3352
02:31:48,680 --> 02:31:51,600
He's not doing legit work in terms of his statistics.

3353
02:31:51,600 --> 02:31:52,600
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3354
02:31:52,600 --> 02:31:54,480
It's so crazy to me, but I love it.

3355
02:31:54,480 --> 02:31:55,480
Of course not.

3356
02:31:55,480 --> 02:31:56,480
I love it.

3357
02:31:56,480 --> 02:31:57,480
I love it.

3358
02:31:57,480 --> 02:31:58,480
That's the kind of stuff I love.

3359
02:31:58,480 --> 02:31:59,600
Because after that-

3360
02:31:59,600 --> 02:32:01,600
Because it's math.

3361
02:32:01,600 --> 02:32:03,200
There's no arguing with math.

3362
02:32:03,200 --> 02:32:08,360
But all of this other stuff, we can deal with reality versus non-reality.

3363
02:32:08,360 --> 02:32:11,480
And there is a question there, and there are kernels of truth.

3364
02:32:11,480 --> 02:32:16,400
In this regard, it is pure analytics, you're lying.

3365
02:32:16,400 --> 02:32:17,400
And I cut the clip-

3366
02:32:17,400 --> 02:32:18,400
And you know you're lying.

3367
02:32:18,400 --> 02:32:19,400
Yeah.

3368
02:32:19,400 --> 02:32:20,400
Yeah.

3369
02:32:20,400 --> 02:32:25,400
And I cut the clip, and where he goes from there is to talk about how like, I'm humbled

3370
02:32:25,400 --> 02:32:27,200
that I'm talking to this many people.

3371
02:32:27,200 --> 02:32:29,880
It's like, do you know you're lying?

3372
02:32:29,880 --> 02:32:30,880
What's going on here?

3373
02:32:30,880 --> 02:32:31,880
It's just this present-

3374
02:32:31,880 --> 02:32:32,880
He knows.

3375
02:32:32,880 --> 02:32:36,520
It's just this presentation of humility that's really fascinating.

3376
02:32:36,520 --> 02:32:37,520
But-

3377
02:32:37,520 --> 02:32:38,520
He has to know.

3378
02:32:38,520 --> 02:32:39,760
There's no possible way he doesn't know.

3379
02:32:39,760 --> 02:32:43,560
Alex, beyond his bullshit about his audience size, he has some other things he wants to

3380
02:32:43,560 --> 02:32:45,120
talk about on the Money Bomb.

3381
02:32:45,120 --> 02:32:51,640
In this next one, Jordan, I've said a lot of things are not true that Alex Jones says

3382
02:32:51,640 --> 02:32:53,640
in the past.

3383
02:32:53,640 --> 02:32:54,640
This one-

3384
02:32:54,640 --> 02:32:57,780
I don't know how many, but it's astronomical.

3385
02:32:57,780 --> 02:33:01,360
It's maybe three and a half billion things that you have said are not true that Alex

3386
02:33:01,360 --> 02:33:02,360
has said.

3387
02:33:02,360 --> 02:33:03,840
That is bigly not true.

3388
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:05,200
Ooh, I don't like that one.

3389
02:33:05,200 --> 02:33:08,080
Because I never get scared when I'm awake during the day.

3390
02:33:08,080 --> 02:33:13,200
I always start crying when I think about this, because I don't want to leave my kids alone

3391
02:33:13,200 --> 02:33:14,200
now more than ever.

3392
02:33:14,200 --> 02:33:16,240
My children need me now more than ever.

3393
02:33:16,240 --> 02:33:22,160
I'm pretty much the only people there for them, and I know in my heart that as all this

3394
02:33:22,160 --> 02:33:26,160
unfolds, this show's going to get bigger and more popular to a dangerous level, because

3395
02:33:26,160 --> 02:33:27,160
we know what's going on.

3396
02:33:27,160 --> 02:33:28,160
You got freaked out by Muslim girls in a Starbucks.

3397
02:33:28,160 --> 02:33:29,160
You're always scared.

3398
02:33:29,160 --> 02:33:33,560
I told my globalist that I'll be just fine until all this comes true, and then that's

3399
02:33:33,560 --> 02:33:36,240
when I better stop.

3400
02:33:36,240 --> 02:33:37,240
I want to go back there, because-

3401
02:33:37,240 --> 02:33:38,640
Yeah, go back and play that.

3402
02:33:38,640 --> 02:33:41,080
I got angry, and it screwed everything up.

3403
02:33:41,080 --> 02:33:42,080
I apologize.

3404
02:33:42,080 --> 02:33:43,080
That's all right.

3405
02:33:43,080 --> 02:33:47,600
And I've been told by top globalist that I'll be just fine until all this comes true, and

3406
02:33:47,600 --> 02:33:49,480
then that's when I better stop.

3407
02:33:49,480 --> 02:33:53,040
And the criticism is, what do you want money for if you're ready to stop?

3408
02:33:53,040 --> 02:33:55,020
Oh, I'm not going to stop during the collapse.

3409
02:33:55,020 --> 02:33:58,280
I'm going to go to the next level and put everything on the table and be all in.

3410
02:33:58,280 --> 02:34:02,720
That's what you do when the enemy comes in like a flood.

3411
02:34:02,720 --> 02:34:06,120
This is the end of the West, the end of humanity as we know it.

3412
02:34:06,120 --> 02:34:08,100
This is a total satanic takeover.

3413
02:34:08,100 --> 02:34:09,600
Don't you understand it's real?

3414
02:34:09,600 --> 02:34:11,360
No, it's not.

3415
02:34:11,360 --> 02:34:14,000
But you got told by a top globalist.

3416
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
What top globalists are talking?

3417
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:17,080
George Soros?

3418
02:34:17,080 --> 02:34:18,520
Is he hanging out with Soros?

3419
02:34:18,520 --> 02:34:19,520
Why is he...

3420
02:34:19,520 --> 02:34:20,520
What?

3421
02:34:20,520 --> 02:34:21,520
Okay.

3422
02:34:21,520 --> 02:34:29,360
I believe that the globalists are demonic beings from a different dimension.

3423
02:34:29,360 --> 02:34:34,480
Which I would say, if that is true, if you see one, kill it.

3424
02:34:34,480 --> 02:34:35,480
Yeah, right?

3425
02:34:35,480 --> 02:34:36,480
Right?

3426
02:34:36,480 --> 02:34:38,840
Why would you have a patient conversation?

3427
02:34:38,840 --> 02:34:41,280
Why would you go to a cocktail party with one?

3428
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:42,280
Hey, listen.

3429
02:34:42,280 --> 02:34:47,200
I know you're a demonic monster hell-bent on destroying humanity, but come on, you got

3430
02:34:47,200 --> 02:34:49,440
any juicy inside tips for me?

3431
02:34:49,440 --> 02:34:50,760
I'm doing a radio show.

3432
02:34:50,760 --> 02:34:51,760
Come on, man.

3433
02:34:51,760 --> 02:34:52,760
Am I safe?

3434
02:34:52,760 --> 02:34:53,760
Yeah.

3435
02:34:53,760 --> 02:34:54,760
Am I?

3436
02:34:54,760 --> 02:34:55,760
That's right, because that's what he's talking about.

3437
02:34:55,760 --> 02:34:56,760
Yeah.

3438
02:34:56,760 --> 02:35:00,800
He's talking to these top globalists who are like, keep on your shit.

3439
02:35:00,800 --> 02:35:02,960
Well, no, this goes back to what we...

3440
02:35:02,960 --> 02:35:06,280
Until we win, in which case you better get out.

3441
02:35:06,280 --> 02:35:09,720
This goes back to what we were talking about at the beginning of this episode, this idea

3442
02:35:09,720 --> 02:35:14,800
of the internet version of the elites and the Illuminati.

3443
02:35:14,800 --> 02:35:17,720
They need to have everyone know what they're doing.

3444
02:35:17,720 --> 02:35:18,720
Right.

3445
02:35:18,720 --> 02:35:19,720
It's that lesser magic idea.

3446
02:35:19,720 --> 02:35:21,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3447
02:35:21,480 --> 02:35:25,240
You need to know what we're doing to you, and then if you don't do anything, you consent

3448
02:35:25,240 --> 02:35:26,740
to it.

3449
02:35:26,740 --> 02:35:31,960
They're using Alex as a conduit to tell people what they're doing to them.

3450
02:35:31,960 --> 02:35:34,840
And if they don't fight back, then whatever.

3451
02:35:34,840 --> 02:35:35,840
Un-fucking-believable.

3452
02:35:35,840 --> 02:35:41,040
But what's magical about that entire line of argument is, hey, the only way to really

3453
02:35:41,040 --> 02:35:42,920
fight back is give Alex Jones money.

3454
02:35:42,920 --> 02:35:43,920
Yeah.

3455
02:35:43,920 --> 02:35:44,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3456
02:35:44,920 --> 02:35:46,440
He's the only one who's saying this crazy bullshit.

3457
02:35:46,440 --> 02:35:52,320
I guess if I don't really support him, then I consented to being destroyed, and then demons

3458
02:35:52,320 --> 02:35:53,320
are gonna take over.

3459
02:35:53,320 --> 02:35:54,320
That is...

3460
02:35:54,320 --> 02:35:55,320
It's brilliant.

3461
02:35:55,320 --> 02:35:56,320
That is brilliant.

3462
02:35:56,320 --> 02:35:57,320
It's brilliant.

3463
02:35:57,320 --> 02:35:58,320
That is brilliant.

3464
02:35:58,320 --> 02:35:59,320
It's so fucking stupid.

3465
02:35:59,320 --> 02:36:00,320
I don't think you can...

3466
02:36:00,320 --> 02:36:04,880
I don't think most of his listeners would be able to articulate exactly what line of...

3467
02:36:04,880 --> 02:36:06,760
Or that train of logic that you just put forward.

3468
02:36:06,760 --> 02:36:08,520
No, because they have too much fluoride in the water.

3469
02:36:08,520 --> 02:36:10,040
But it makes perfect sense.

3470
02:36:10,040 --> 02:36:11,040
Of course.

3471
02:36:11,040 --> 02:36:12,040
If you're an insane person.

3472
02:36:12,040 --> 02:36:13,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3473
02:36:13,040 --> 02:36:15,640
Or if you're just an afraid person, because that's what this...

3474
02:36:15,640 --> 02:36:19,000
It's not that these people are all insane, it's that they're terrified and they don't

3475
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:20,000
know what's going on.

3476
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:26,160
I've spent a lot of periods of my life in various stages of paranoia and anxiety.

3477
02:36:26,160 --> 02:36:30,720
I have mental illness, I've done a lot of drugs in the past, and so I know weird head

3478
02:36:30,720 --> 02:36:31,720
spaces.

3479
02:36:31,720 --> 02:36:32,720
Yeah.

3480
02:36:32,720 --> 02:36:33,720
And I can sort of...

3481
02:36:33,720 --> 02:36:36,000
I can suss out where things are coming from.

3482
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:37,000
Right.

3483
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:41,720
And I don't mean to put too fine a point on this, but I've dwelt in the weirdest parts

3484
02:36:41,720 --> 02:36:42,720
of the internet.

3485
02:36:42,720 --> 02:36:50,160
These conspiracy forums and these weird Illuminati forums, these message boards.

3486
02:36:50,160 --> 02:36:54,880
I've read all this stuff that people talk about, and none of it's based on anything,

3487
02:36:54,880 --> 02:36:57,900
and so much of it is mirrored in what Alex is talking about.

3488
02:36:57,900 --> 02:37:04,320
This idea of the lesser magic, the idea that we've got to tell you, then you're in.

3489
02:37:04,320 --> 02:37:05,800
It's so dumb.

3490
02:37:05,800 --> 02:37:09,440
It's so based on nothing, and it's so manipulative.

3491
02:37:09,440 --> 02:37:10,440
And that's what he's doing.

3492
02:37:10,440 --> 02:37:11,440
It's great.

3493
02:37:11,440 --> 02:37:12,440
I love it.

3494
02:37:12,440 --> 02:37:13,440
I love it.

3495
02:37:13,440 --> 02:37:14,440
I love it.

3496
02:37:14,440 --> 02:37:15,440
I love it.

3497
02:37:15,440 --> 02:37:16,440
Top globalists say he's safe.

3498
02:37:16,440 --> 02:37:17,440
Why?

3499
02:37:17,440 --> 02:37:18,440
What?

3500
02:37:18,440 --> 02:37:19,440
Who is...

3501
02:37:19,440 --> 02:37:22,440
How is he even getting a meeting with top globalists?

3502
02:37:22,440 --> 02:37:23,440
He runs into them all the time.

3503
02:37:23,440 --> 02:37:25,440
Remember, he talked to that one on the plane.

3504
02:37:25,440 --> 02:37:26,440
Oh, that's right.

3505
02:37:26,440 --> 02:37:27,440
He runs into them all the time.

3506
02:37:27,440 --> 02:37:28,440
That's right.

3507
02:37:28,440 --> 02:37:29,440
And they keep calling him, trying to get him to join up.

3508
02:37:29,440 --> 02:37:30,440
They are everywhere.

3509
02:37:30,440 --> 02:37:31,440
They need to join up.

3510
02:37:31,440 --> 02:37:32,440
Absolutely.

3511
02:37:32,440 --> 02:37:33,440
No, no, no.

3512
02:37:33,440 --> 02:37:34,440
I got you.

3513
02:37:34,440 --> 02:37:35,440
They're always courting Alex Jones.

3514
02:37:35,440 --> 02:37:36,440
You're right.

3515
02:37:36,440 --> 02:37:37,440
So Alex...

3516
02:37:37,440 --> 02:37:45,080
He's a part of the mythology that, just like his fucking Prometheus bullshit, like, we

3517
02:37:45,080 --> 02:37:47,560
need to be more like Prometheus, who God loved.

3518
02:37:47,560 --> 02:37:49,760
And you're like, wait, no, hold on one second.

3519
02:37:49,760 --> 02:37:50,760
You don't understand.

3520
02:37:50,760 --> 02:37:51,760
No, no, no.

3521
02:37:51,760 --> 02:37:52,760
You misinterpreted that.

3522
02:37:52,760 --> 02:37:53,760
Oh, I did?

3523
02:37:53,760 --> 02:37:54,760
Yeah.

3524
02:37:54,760 --> 02:37:55,760
You misinterpreted that.

3525
02:37:55,760 --> 02:37:56,760
How so?

3526
02:37:56,760 --> 02:38:00,420
Because what he's saying is the God that I would be into, the elite version that I would

3527
02:38:00,420 --> 02:38:04,160
be into, is that one who brings us Promethean fire.

3528
02:38:04,160 --> 02:38:08,040
Now, Prometheus did bring us the fire, and then got his liver pecked out, and then brought

3529
02:38:08,040 --> 02:38:09,040
back everything.

3530
02:38:09,040 --> 02:38:10,040
He got wrecked for it.

3531
02:38:10,040 --> 02:38:11,040
Yeah, yeah.

3532
02:38:11,040 --> 02:38:12,040
But that's the human story.

3533
02:38:12,040 --> 02:38:13,120
But that's the sacrifice that he makes for humanity.

3534
02:38:13,120 --> 02:38:14,120
Yeah.

3535
02:38:14,120 --> 02:38:18,520
So Alex's point is actually very valid in that case, is that the God that I would worship

3536
02:38:18,520 --> 02:38:23,320
is the one that builds us up, because Prometheus did give us fire, and gave us that.

3537
02:38:23,320 --> 02:38:25,360
I don't think there is one.

3538
02:38:25,360 --> 02:38:26,360
No.

3539
02:38:26,360 --> 02:38:29,880
Also, there's not a God.

3540
02:38:29,880 --> 02:38:30,880
Shh, quiet.

3541
02:38:30,880 --> 02:38:32,640
We have a lot of Christian knowledge fighters.

3542
02:38:32,640 --> 02:38:33,640
Yeah, I bet we do.

3543
02:38:33,640 --> 02:38:36,320
I fucking bet we do.

3544
02:38:36,320 --> 02:38:37,320
If you do, God bless you.

3545
02:38:37,320 --> 02:38:38,320
I don't care.

3546
02:38:38,320 --> 02:38:41,840
I don't think there's anything intrinsically negative about religion.

3547
02:38:41,840 --> 02:38:45,840
I think it can bring a lot to your life.

3548
02:38:45,840 --> 02:38:47,640
No comment.

3549
02:38:47,640 --> 02:38:54,680
So this next clip, Alex Jones has been on his bullshit for about, bleh, ever.

3550
02:38:54,680 --> 02:38:57,080
About these liberals want to kill cops.

3551
02:38:57,080 --> 02:38:58,080
Yes.

3552
02:38:58,080 --> 02:38:59,080
Oh, God.

3553
02:38:59,080 --> 02:39:00,080
I don't want to get into the cop narrative.

3554
02:39:00,080 --> 02:39:01,080
No, this one's fun.

3555
02:39:01,080 --> 02:39:02,080
Okay.

3556
02:39:02,080 --> 02:39:07,640
He has an interview with this guy named James Wesley Rawls, who runs a site...

3557
02:39:07,640 --> 02:39:08,640
That's a great name.

3558
02:39:08,640 --> 02:39:09,640
It's not bad.

3559
02:39:09,640 --> 02:39:10,640
That's a great name.

3560
02:39:10,640 --> 02:39:11,640
Good for a serial killer, got three names.

3561
02:39:11,640 --> 02:39:12,640
Absolutely.

3562
02:39:12,640 --> 02:39:13,640
Oh, yeah.

3563
02:39:13,640 --> 02:39:14,640
He runs...

3564
02:39:14,640 --> 02:39:15,920
I would totally be serial killed by that guy.

3565
02:39:15,920 --> 02:39:22,360
He runs a website called survivalblog.com, where he tells you how to survive serial killers.

3566
02:39:22,360 --> 02:39:23,360
Like the globalists.

3567
02:39:23,360 --> 02:39:26,040
He tells you how to survive his own serial killings.

3568
02:39:26,040 --> 02:39:27,520
I think it's a lot of prepping stuff.

3569
02:39:27,520 --> 02:39:31,160
If you don't want to be murdered by me, here's a step-by-step list of instructions.

3570
02:39:31,160 --> 02:39:32,160
Piss me off.

3571
02:39:32,160 --> 02:39:33,160
Piss me off.

3572
02:39:33,160 --> 02:39:34,160
That's it.

3573
02:39:34,160 --> 02:39:35,160
That's the whole blog.

3574
02:39:35,160 --> 02:39:38,160
He is a guy who used to come on on Skype.

3575
02:39:38,160 --> 02:39:40,080
I'm basing this on what Alex has told us.

3576
02:39:40,080 --> 02:39:41,080
Okay.

3577
02:39:41,080 --> 02:39:42,080
He used to come on on Skype.

3578
02:39:42,080 --> 02:39:44,920
Now you don't even want your picture out there because you're so freaked out.

3579
02:39:44,920 --> 02:39:45,920
Too much.

3580
02:39:45,920 --> 02:39:46,920
Weirdo.

3581
02:39:46,920 --> 02:39:47,920
Gotcha.

3582
02:39:47,920 --> 02:39:49,920
So most of the show is an interview with this guy.

3583
02:39:49,920 --> 02:39:56,620
They get into talking about cop killing rhetoric and what have you, and here's that clip.

3584
02:39:56,620 --> 02:39:57,620
It's a paradox.

3585
02:39:57,620 --> 02:39:59,320
They're awake, but they still follow orders.

3586
02:39:59,320 --> 02:40:00,740
The citizens are awake.

3587
02:40:00,740 --> 02:40:02,520
We still put up with it.

3588
02:40:02,520 --> 02:40:07,800
Meanwhile, leftists are out killing police, so they're so fired up once we demonstrate

3589
02:40:07,800 --> 02:40:09,240
they'll attack us.

3590
02:40:09,240 --> 02:40:14,360
I wish there was some sophistication out there that everyone not be played like fiddles.

3591
02:40:14,360 --> 02:40:15,360
Right.

3592
02:40:15,360 --> 02:40:23,180
Well, right now we have a lot of people being played like puppets, indeed, where radicals

3593
02:40:23,180 --> 02:40:31,780
are being pushed toward killing police officers, for example, where, you know, there wasn't

3594
02:40:31,780 --> 02:40:36,360
even talk of that for about a twenty-five period in this country.

3595
02:40:36,360 --> 02:40:40,880
You have to go all the way back to late 1960s or early 70s with the Black Panther movement

3596
02:40:40,880 --> 02:40:45,680
to see, you know, at the time they referred to it as the kill the killers movement.

3597
02:40:45,680 --> 02:40:46,680
Fucking anybody.

3598
02:40:46,680 --> 02:40:52,320
That kind of went quiet for a long, long time in this nation.

3599
02:40:52,320 --> 02:40:55,560
And seeing that reemerge is very troubling.

3600
02:40:55,560 --> 02:40:56,560
That's very troubling.

3601
02:40:56,560 --> 02:40:57,560
What's more troubling?

3602
02:40:57,560 --> 02:41:02,960
Fucking listen to anybody who's not fucking white!

3603
02:41:02,960 --> 02:41:06,360
N.W.A. had fuck the police in 1988.

3604
02:41:06,360 --> 02:41:07,640
What does this do?

3605
02:41:07,640 --> 02:41:10,920
Body count had cop killer in 1992.

3606
02:41:10,920 --> 02:41:13,940
How many times does this happen?

3607
02:41:13,940 --> 02:41:16,120
This happens to so many white people.

3608
02:41:16,120 --> 02:41:17,440
9-1-1 is a joke.

3609
02:41:17,440 --> 02:41:18,440
Came out in 1990.

3610
02:41:18,440 --> 02:41:20,680
Granted, that wasn't cop killing, but that was...

3611
02:41:20,680 --> 02:41:25,920
So many white people always come with, uh, I've never heard this shit before.

3612
02:41:25,920 --> 02:41:28,480
When did they start talking about this?

3613
02:41:28,480 --> 02:41:31,600
Like fucking everybody, always!

3614
02:41:31,600 --> 02:41:37,040
I think that's really, like, when we talk about feminism and racism and these sorts

3615
02:41:37,040 --> 02:41:42,880
of things and how blind Alex is to so many things and how reactionary he is, a lot of

3616
02:41:42,880 --> 02:41:47,640
it really does boil down in some ways to, like, you're not listening.

3617
02:41:47,640 --> 02:41:49,640
You're not listening.

3618
02:41:49,640 --> 02:41:56,720
And maybe the larger avenue there is just that nobody was, nobody in your world was

3619
02:41:56,720 --> 02:41:57,720
talking about it.

3620
02:41:57,720 --> 02:41:58,720
Yeah, and no one...

3621
02:41:58,720 --> 02:42:02,600
Because that was, that was the thing, like, if you go back to the 80s with N.W.A., you

3622
02:42:02,600 --> 02:42:08,040
see all those local news spots going, like, is rap out of control?

3623
02:42:08,040 --> 02:42:14,000
Like all of those different things, and never are black people being murdered by the cops!

3624
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:19,480
Now let's take, like, reality out of it and sensible discourse out of it.

3625
02:42:19,480 --> 02:42:21,200
Let's just remove that for a second.

3626
02:42:21,200 --> 02:42:23,280
Which is the entire focus of this podcast.

3627
02:42:23,280 --> 02:42:27,880
Think about how many people were fucking talking about taking out the police after the Rodney

3628
02:42:27,880 --> 02:42:28,880
King stuff.

3629
02:42:28,880 --> 02:42:29,880
Oh my god.

3630
02:42:29,880 --> 02:42:30,880
And that was not in the 60s.

3631
02:42:30,880 --> 02:42:31,880
No.

3632
02:42:31,880 --> 02:42:32,880
No, no, no, no.

3633
02:42:32,880 --> 02:42:40,040
So, I mean, like, even that is just a very clear example of fucking James Wesley Rawls

3634
02:42:40,040 --> 02:42:41,040
is an idiot.

3635
02:42:41,040 --> 02:42:42,040
Yeah.

3636
02:42:42,040 --> 02:42:43,880
He is a fucking ahistorical idiot.

3637
02:42:43,880 --> 02:42:44,880
Right.

3638
02:42:44,880 --> 02:42:48,560
But, hey, you know what, he's got a blog.

3639
02:42:48,560 --> 02:42:49,560
That's pretty cool.

3640
02:42:49,560 --> 02:42:50,920
God damn it.

3641
02:42:50,920 --> 02:42:56,260
So James Wesley Rawls is a nutty kind of dude.

3642
02:42:56,260 --> 02:43:02,240
One of his basic arguments that he's making within this interview is that the globalists

3643
02:43:02,240 --> 02:43:06,000
created radical Islam in order to fight against them.

3644
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:07,000
Logical.

3645
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,880
Like, they're fighting against the West, because they needed a better enemy.

3646
02:43:09,880 --> 02:43:10,880
Controlled opposition.

3647
02:43:10,880 --> 02:43:11,880
Yeah.

3648
02:43:11,880 --> 02:43:12,880
They needed, like, a-

3649
02:43:12,880 --> 02:43:14,240
We had the Nazis, now we gotta get Islam.

3650
02:43:14,240 --> 02:43:19,080
They need a scary enemy that they can fight against, and in that way curtail our freedoms

3651
02:43:19,080 --> 02:43:24,520
and then create a one-world religion that is partially Islamic, and a one-world government.

3652
02:43:24,520 --> 02:43:25,520
Sure.

3653
02:43:25,520 --> 02:43:26,520
It's nonsense.

3654
02:43:26,520 --> 02:43:31,920
But again, it doubles back into this shit that Alex talks about, where you're radicalizing

3655
02:43:31,920 --> 02:43:36,960
the enemy that you are imagining in order to justify your radical nature.

3656
02:43:36,960 --> 02:43:37,960
Yeah.

3657
02:43:37,960 --> 02:43:41,020
There's a ton of that in his discourse.

3658
02:43:41,020 --> 02:43:44,080
And this is the fucking money bomb.

3659
02:43:44,080 --> 02:43:45,080
Most of the show.

3660
02:43:45,080 --> 02:43:46,080
That's right.

3661
02:43:46,080 --> 02:43:47,080
This is the money bomb we're into.

3662
02:43:47,080 --> 02:43:48,080
Most of the show-

3663
02:43:48,080 --> 02:43:49,080
It's fear.

3664
02:43:49,080 --> 02:43:50,080
It's fear.

3665
02:43:50,080 --> 02:43:51,080
Yes.

3666
02:43:51,080 --> 02:43:52,080
Yeah.

3667
02:43:52,080 --> 02:43:53,080
Fear and-

3668
02:43:53,080 --> 02:43:54,080
The money bomb is fear.

3669
02:43:54,080 --> 02:43:56,000
Fear and we are much more numerous than you think.

3670
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:57,160
You are not alone.

3671
02:43:57,160 --> 02:43:58,160
It's all of us.

3672
02:43:58,160 --> 02:44:00,680
There's 3.5 billion of us.

3673
02:44:00,680 --> 02:44:01,680
Don't feel bad.

3674
02:44:01,680 --> 02:44:06,780
Don't eat to us, because you're just one of- it's like when a busker has a dollar bill

3675
02:44:06,780 --> 02:44:09,440
already in his hat whenever he pulls it out.

3676
02:44:09,440 --> 02:44:10,680
You're priming the pot.

3677
02:44:10,680 --> 02:44:11,680
Exactly.

3678
02:44:11,680 --> 02:44:13,000
You're making sure that people know it's okay.

3679
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:17,800
Yeah, there's 3.5 billion people behind you, but just fucking support us because we're

3680
02:44:17,800 --> 02:44:22,040
the only ones fighting these fake globalists.

3681
02:44:22,040 --> 02:44:24,440
Before Rawls gets out-

3682
02:44:24,440 --> 02:44:30,520
Can you imagine how much money he would have if he actually reached three and a half billion

3683
02:44:30,520 --> 02:44:31,520
people?

3684
02:44:31,520 --> 02:44:34,520
Well, if everyone gave him a quarter.

3685
02:44:34,520 --> 02:44:35,520
Yeah.

3686
02:44:35,520 --> 02:44:36,520
Yeah.

3687
02:44:36,520 --> 02:44:37,520
Oh, man.

3688
02:44:37,520 --> 02:44:43,560
We're considering the insane markup he has on these products, even when they're on sale,

3689
02:44:43,560 --> 02:44:47,560
which I didn't even mean to bring up, but let's fucking talk about it.

3690
02:44:47,560 --> 02:44:48,560
Okay.

3691
02:44:48,560 --> 02:44:49,560
Let's get into it.

3692
02:44:49,560 --> 02:44:52,680
During the money bomb, unprecedented sales-

3693
02:44:52,680 --> 02:44:54,000
Is it like an Easter sale?

3694
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:55,000
Yeah, he's constantly-

3695
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:56,000
30% off?

3696
02:44:56,000 --> 02:45:01,040
He's constantly talking about like, all right, got the brain force, that's on sale until

3697
02:45:01,040 --> 02:45:03,840
the show is over, got free shipping on everything.

3698
02:45:03,840 --> 02:45:04,840
Infomercial style.

3699
02:45:04,840 --> 02:45:10,020
He's basically talking about things being at cost, just like, got to move it, that sort

3700
02:45:10,020 --> 02:45:11,020
of thing.

3701
02:45:11,020 --> 02:45:12,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3702
02:45:12,020 --> 02:45:15,320
He's like, hey, this is a loss leader, everyone's going to come in and make money on it, which

3703
02:45:15,320 --> 02:45:16,320
is bullshit.

3704
02:45:16,320 --> 02:45:17,320
I mean, well-

3705
02:45:17,320 --> 02:45:18,320
He's pretending.

3706
02:45:18,320 --> 02:45:22,880
If you are looking at the end of the fiscal year though, just because you're-

3707
02:45:22,880 --> 02:45:24,040
You got to get that product out of there.

3708
02:45:24,040 --> 02:45:25,040
If you're selling it, it's revenue.

3709
02:45:25,040 --> 02:45:26,040
Because otherwise, yeah.

3710
02:45:26,040 --> 02:45:27,040
Otherwise-

3711
02:45:27,040 --> 02:45:31,440
It doesn't matter if you're making a profit on it or not, it's still money you have.

3712
02:45:31,440 --> 02:45:35,320
And it's not like that stuff you bought isn't going to factor into the end of the fiscal

3713
02:45:35,320 --> 02:45:36,320
year.

3714
02:45:36,320 --> 02:45:37,320
Of course, of course.

3715
02:45:37,320 --> 02:45:39,920
You're balancing the books in some ways, even if you sell it for no profit.

3716
02:45:39,920 --> 02:45:40,920
Yeah.

3717
02:45:40,920 --> 02:45:41,920
Which might-

3718
02:45:41,920 --> 02:45:42,920
I don't know when we got into business.

3719
02:45:42,920 --> 02:45:43,920
I don't know when this happened.

3720
02:45:43,920 --> 02:45:44,920
I'm an accountant.

3721
02:45:44,920 --> 02:45:45,920
Oh, that's right.

3722
02:45:45,920 --> 02:45:46,920
You are an accountant.

3723
02:45:46,920 --> 02:45:47,920
But it might still be like-

3724
02:45:47,920 --> 02:45:49,200
I'm just an interested party.

3725
02:45:49,200 --> 02:45:57,120
It might be indicative of the fact that he may be overbought and is in a hole, or just

3726
02:45:57,120 --> 02:45:58,200
is in a hole generally.

3727
02:45:58,200 --> 02:45:59,200
I don't know.

3728
02:45:59,200 --> 02:46:00,200
Anyway.

3729
02:46:00,200 --> 02:46:06,760
But Rawls, before he gets out of the episode, has to say one of the scariest things I've

3730
02:46:06,760 --> 02:46:08,840
heard a guest say on Alex Jones' show.

3731
02:46:08,840 --> 02:46:09,840
Oh boy.

3732
02:46:09,840 --> 02:46:10,840
Here we go.

3733
02:46:10,840 --> 02:46:15,920
There's going to be huge numbers of Christian refugees in the coming decades.

3734
02:46:15,920 --> 02:46:23,880
And I believe that there is actually a need for a new homeland nation for persecuted Christian

3735
02:46:23,880 --> 02:46:29,680
and messianic Jewish refugees who are going to be pushed out of countries in huge numbers

3736
02:46:29,680 --> 02:46:30,680
in the years to come.

3737
02:46:30,680 --> 02:46:36,600
And that's why I decided to write my Counter-Caliphate Chronicles series.

3738
02:46:36,600 --> 02:46:41,800
That first novel called Land of Promise describes the establishment of a Christian homeland

3739
02:46:41,800 --> 02:46:43,120
nation.

3740
02:46:43,120 --> 02:46:48,520
And I also made it fictionally a Christian libertarian nation to illustrate a lot of

3741
02:46:48,520 --> 02:46:49,560
other points.

3742
02:46:49,560 --> 02:46:52,280
But I do think that that is needed.

3743
02:46:52,280 --> 02:46:59,560
And we need to pray that God would provide a safe haven for persecuted Christians all

3744
02:46:59,560 --> 02:47:00,560
over the world.

3745
02:47:00,560 --> 02:47:05,240
I would argue that most of the time, when religiously specific countries have been created,

3746
02:47:05,240 --> 02:47:08,240
it hasn't gone great.

3747
02:47:08,240 --> 02:47:13,760
The thing I hear there, though, is that he's saying, so many Christian refugees, we need

3748
02:47:13,760 --> 02:47:18,920
a homeland nation, and we're creating a counter-caliphate.

3749
02:47:18,920 --> 02:47:19,920
Which is like, wait.

3750
02:47:19,920 --> 02:47:23,560
Counter-Caliphate is the name of his novel series that he's written.

3751
02:47:23,560 --> 02:47:30,420
But the point being, we hate this thing that is persecuting us, so let's make exactly that

3752
02:47:30,420 --> 02:47:31,420
thing.

3753
02:47:31,420 --> 02:47:32,420
But our version.

3754
02:47:32,420 --> 02:47:33,420
But our version.

3755
02:47:33,420 --> 02:47:34,420
Yeah.

3756
02:47:34,420 --> 02:47:35,420
That's insane to me.

3757
02:47:35,420 --> 02:47:37,440
That mentality pervades Alex Jones's guests.

3758
02:47:37,440 --> 02:47:38,440
Well, that's a good point.

3759
02:47:38,440 --> 02:47:40,120
I don't understand why you're shocked by that.

3760
02:47:40,120 --> 02:47:45,960
I know, but it just, well, and frankly, this is what we've been talking about for months

3761
02:47:45,960 --> 02:47:46,960
now.

3762
02:47:46,960 --> 02:47:47,960
Yeah, basically forever.

3763
02:47:47,960 --> 02:47:55,000
And it never fails to surprise me that people don't stop for one fucking second and think,

3764
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:58,800
oh, well, this thing is bad, so let's not do this thing.

3765
02:47:58,800 --> 02:48:02,240
Well, because they have this...

3766
02:48:02,240 --> 02:48:04,080
But then again, then again, you know what?

3767
02:48:04,080 --> 02:48:12,360
At the same point, every Democrat said, you know, when they go low, we go high.

3768
02:48:12,360 --> 02:48:13,360
Not every Democrat.

3769
02:48:13,360 --> 02:48:14,360
Well, no, not every Democrat.

3770
02:48:14,360 --> 02:48:20,640
But Marty DeRosa, fucking policy wonk and friend of the show, he and I were having this

3771
02:48:20,640 --> 02:48:25,920
conversation where it's like, we all said when they go low, we go high, and now we're

3772
02:48:25,920 --> 02:48:31,560
kind of at the position where it's like, oh, when they go low, you fucking go goddamn lower.

3773
02:48:31,560 --> 02:48:33,400
Fucking get into there.

3774
02:48:33,400 --> 02:48:34,400
So I don't know.

3775
02:48:34,400 --> 02:48:35,400
I don't know, man.

3776
02:48:35,400 --> 02:48:36,400
When they go low, chop block.

3777
02:48:36,400 --> 02:48:37,400
Right?

3778
02:48:37,400 --> 02:48:38,400
I don't know.

3779
02:48:38,400 --> 02:48:41,320
Don't punch somebody when they've taken out your knees, like, I don't know.

3780
02:48:41,320 --> 02:48:45,280
It's not in any way justifying the idea of like, we need our own Christian...

3781
02:48:45,280 --> 02:48:46,280
No, pogroms.

3782
02:48:46,280 --> 02:48:47,280
Pogroms.

3783
02:48:47,280 --> 02:48:48,280
Okay.

3784
02:48:48,280 --> 02:48:53,800
So the rest of Alex Jones' September 16th show for the money bomb.

3785
02:48:53,800 --> 02:48:56,120
Before we go any further, I do think he's right.

3786
02:48:56,120 --> 02:49:01,240
There will be a lot of Christian refugees in the same way that there will be a lot of

3787
02:49:01,240 --> 02:49:02,520
refugees total.

3788
02:49:02,520 --> 02:49:03,520
Period.

3789
02:49:03,520 --> 02:49:08,400
Immediately following, like, considering the effects of climate change, what does happen

3790
02:49:08,400 --> 02:49:10,920
in our country in specific, right?

3791
02:49:10,920 --> 02:49:17,000
So right now, we have a shit ton of Muslim refugees from all of these places.

3792
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,120
And but not entirely.

3793
02:49:19,120 --> 02:49:20,120
But not entirely.

3794
02:49:20,120 --> 02:49:21,440
It's not all Muslims.

3795
02:49:21,440 --> 02:49:25,600
But my point is that so many people are up in arms about this.

3796
02:49:25,600 --> 02:49:30,720
When we just start talking about refugees with no religion in front of it, think about

3797
02:49:30,720 --> 02:49:33,840
how many Christian refugees and how many all of these things...

3798
02:49:33,840 --> 02:49:38,160
Everyone's going to scapegoat depending on the adjective that is part of the refugee

3799
02:49:38,160 --> 02:49:39,160
part thing.

3800
02:49:39,160 --> 02:49:40,160
Exactly.

3801
02:49:40,160 --> 02:49:41,160
How many refugees...

3802
02:49:41,160 --> 02:49:42,480
How many Christian refugees?

3803
02:49:42,480 --> 02:49:47,360
What's the number before people start saying, well, we don't want any more refugees total?

3804
02:49:47,360 --> 02:49:53,680
It's the fun part of complaining about refugees stuff because like, hey, they're gonna be

3805
02:49:53,680 --> 02:49:55,880
Christians while you deny climate change.

3806
02:49:55,880 --> 02:49:56,880
Exactly.

3807
02:49:56,880 --> 02:49:57,880
It's a fun game to play.

3808
02:49:57,880 --> 02:49:58,880
Like, this is going to happen.

3809
02:49:58,880 --> 02:50:00,760
It's a fun, fun game.

3810
02:50:00,760 --> 02:50:02,360
What's the number, though?

3811
02:50:02,360 --> 02:50:04,400
Like how many...

3812
02:50:04,400 --> 02:50:08,760
For fuck's sakes, imagine we're talking about Rome.

3813
02:50:08,760 --> 02:50:14,200
All of the Catholics, for whatever reason, need to move.

3814
02:50:14,200 --> 02:50:19,280
How many people in the United States before it starts going like, well, we can't allow

3815
02:50:19,280 --> 02:50:20,960
any refugees in?

3816
02:50:20,960 --> 02:50:24,080
Regardless of religion, we just can't allow refugees in.

3817
02:50:24,080 --> 02:50:28,880
But let's even imagine a scenario wherein, and this may not be the case, I'm not saying

3818
02:50:28,880 --> 02:50:35,660
it necessarily is, but let's imagine a scenario where it just so happens that Muslim dominated

3819
02:50:35,660 --> 02:50:40,500
countries happen to be the places that are safer from climate change.

3820
02:50:40,500 --> 02:50:41,500
Let's imagine that.

3821
02:50:41,500 --> 02:50:42,500
Right, right, right, right.

3822
02:50:42,500 --> 02:50:47,220
So let's imagine like Saudi Arabia is a place that is unaffected by climate change.

3823
02:50:47,220 --> 02:50:49,200
And now these Catholics that are displaced from...

3824
02:50:49,200 --> 02:50:51,760
Because it's a fucking desert, so...

3825
02:50:51,760 --> 02:50:52,760
And now it's wonderful.

3826
02:50:52,760 --> 02:50:55,220
Yeah, now it's a fucking utopia.

3827
02:50:55,220 --> 02:51:01,560
So let's imagine that these Catholics from the south of Italy, where it's flooded to

3828
02:51:01,560 --> 02:51:03,440
shit, now have to find a place...

3829
02:51:03,440 --> 02:51:04,640
Venice is fucking gone.

3830
02:51:04,640 --> 02:51:05,640
Done.

3831
02:51:05,640 --> 02:51:11,480
Now they have to go somewhere, and they go into Saudi Arabia, and Saudi Arabia, I mean,

3832
02:51:11,480 --> 02:51:15,200
let's not unpack all of their negative cultural problems.

3833
02:51:15,200 --> 02:51:17,000
Let's just talk about people coming in.

3834
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:23,240
Let's say that they have a way of life, and these Catholics come in and want to change

3835
02:51:23,240 --> 02:51:24,240
everything.

3836
02:51:24,240 --> 02:51:25,240
Yeah.

3837
02:51:25,240 --> 02:51:26,240
Ugh.

3838
02:51:26,240 --> 02:51:27,240
Ugh.

3839
02:51:27,240 --> 02:51:30,680
How is it that people can't do that next step thought?

3840
02:51:30,680 --> 02:51:31,680
I don't know.

3841
02:51:31,680 --> 02:51:33,280
Like think about that reciprocity.

3842
02:51:33,280 --> 02:51:35,240
I think people are too caught up in their identity.

3843
02:51:35,240 --> 02:51:36,920
Yeah, that's probably true.

3844
02:51:36,920 --> 02:51:41,280
That's why whenever we talk about Alex Jones, I don't like to call him a white supremacist.

3845
02:51:41,280 --> 02:51:44,600
I like to say that he's caught up in white identity.

3846
02:51:44,600 --> 02:51:46,600
White Christian male identity.

3847
02:51:46,600 --> 02:51:50,800
Because that I think is more to the point than saying he's a white supremacist.

3848
02:51:50,800 --> 02:51:54,800
It's way too easy to say that he thinks he's better than everybody, because of course he

3849
02:51:54,800 --> 02:51:55,800
does.

3850
02:51:55,800 --> 02:52:02,400
But what really motivates him is his identification with what makes him white, what makes him

3851
02:52:02,400 --> 02:52:05,040
male, what makes him Christian.

3852
02:52:05,040 --> 02:52:11,200
And I think that it's too threatening to a lot of people to imagine a world wherein that

3853
02:52:11,200 --> 02:52:13,600
identity is problematic to other people.

3854
02:52:13,600 --> 02:52:14,600
Yeah.

3855
02:52:14,600 --> 02:52:15,600
Yeah.

3856
02:52:15,600 --> 02:52:16,600
Because it becomes threatening.

3857
02:52:16,600 --> 02:52:18,000
That's the whole fight, right?

3858
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:22,800
Like that's their whole argument is that because the demographics are changing, all of a sudden

3859
02:52:22,800 --> 02:52:28,360
they have the thought of, wait, maybe they start thinking what we think about them about

3860
02:52:28,360 --> 02:52:29,360
us.

3861
02:52:29,360 --> 02:52:37,000
I mean, I read a really interesting assessment of someone was pointing out that a lot of

3862
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:47,080
homophobia is based on a fear by really aggressive, angry dudes that men will treat them like

3863
02:52:47,080 --> 02:52:49,520
they treat women.

3864
02:52:49,520 --> 02:52:52,120
And I think that there is a bit of that in...

3865
02:52:52,120 --> 02:52:53,520
That's a really good thought.

3866
02:52:53,520 --> 02:52:58,200
I think there's a lot of that in tons of this stuff.

3867
02:52:58,200 --> 02:53:03,480
Marx is afraid that minorities will treat him how he thinks about them.

3868
02:53:03,480 --> 02:53:04,480
It's reciprocity.

3869
02:53:04,480 --> 02:53:05,480
Yeah.

3870
02:53:05,480 --> 02:53:08,880
That's what they're really afraid of, all of their crimes coming back against them.

3871
02:53:08,880 --> 02:53:09,880
Right.

3872
02:53:09,880 --> 02:53:11,880
They're afraid of karma.

3873
02:53:11,880 --> 02:53:12,880
In many ways.

3874
02:53:12,880 --> 02:53:13,880
Yeah.

3875
02:53:13,880 --> 02:53:15,520
So the rest of the...

3876
02:53:15,520 --> 02:53:20,160
That's just the thing that I have always considered.

3877
02:53:20,160 --> 02:53:26,260
And it is one of those things in the later stages of Obama's presidency that I was concerned

3878
02:53:26,260 --> 02:53:32,480
about is because of that executive overreach, because of how much power we gave Obama, Trump

3879
02:53:32,480 --> 02:53:34,320
now has that power.

3880
02:53:34,320 --> 02:53:35,420
Like they just never...

3881
02:53:35,420 --> 02:53:38,560
We just never considered that it could be used against us.

3882
02:53:38,560 --> 02:53:40,160
That's not true.

3883
02:53:40,160 --> 02:53:41,160
In the...

3884
02:53:41,160 --> 02:53:45,580
I mean, I agree with the point, but when that was happening, when that executive power was

3885
02:53:45,580 --> 02:53:51,920
given to Obama, there were people such as myself and other folks, yeah, you as well,

3886
02:53:51,920 --> 02:53:54,480
who were like, this is not good.

3887
02:53:54,480 --> 02:54:00,960
There should not be like, and it goes back to Bush, the idea of being able to unilaterally

3888
02:54:00,960 --> 02:54:02,320
launch wars.

3889
02:54:02,320 --> 02:54:04,600
That sort of thing is not in the power of the executive.

3890
02:54:04,600 --> 02:54:06,840
The executive branch became way too strong.

3891
02:54:06,840 --> 02:54:13,480
And even with Obama in power, I know tons of Democrats and liberal-minded people who

3892
02:54:13,480 --> 02:54:15,200
are super against that.

3893
02:54:15,200 --> 02:54:16,440
And it wasn't enough.

3894
02:54:16,440 --> 02:54:24,040
It wasn't enough to sway the Congress, sway the actual people who made decisions.

3895
02:54:24,040 --> 02:54:25,040
Imagine...

3896
02:54:25,040 --> 02:54:29,280
Yeah, no, I'm out.

3897
02:54:29,280 --> 02:54:30,280
It just becomes...

3898
02:54:30,280 --> 02:54:31,280
I'm out.

3899
02:54:31,280 --> 02:54:32,280
That's insane.

3900
02:54:32,280 --> 02:54:33,280
It's insane.

3901
02:54:33,280 --> 02:54:35,400
It's political opportunism by the...

3902
02:54:35,400 --> 02:54:40,240
I mean, if we keep this conversation going more than 10 minutes, we're going to say,

3903
02:54:40,240 --> 02:54:41,240
let's overthrow everything.

3904
02:54:41,240 --> 02:54:42,240
Because I think...

3905
02:54:42,240 --> 02:54:48,120
This whole thing has been me just pushing you closer to my side.

3906
02:54:48,120 --> 02:54:50,840
Little do you know, I'm already there, but...

3907
02:54:50,840 --> 02:54:51,840
Don't reveal that.

3908
02:54:51,840 --> 02:54:52,840
Don't reveal that.

3909
02:54:52,840 --> 02:54:53,840
You're our cover.

3910
02:54:53,840 --> 02:54:54,840
You're our cover.

3911
02:54:54,840 --> 02:54:55,840
You're our cover.

3912
02:54:55,840 --> 02:54:56,840
So, September 16th...

3913
02:54:56,840 --> 02:54:57,840
I'm the revolution.

3914
02:54:57,840 --> 02:54:59,840
You're the one who's keeping us legitimate.

3915
02:54:59,840 --> 02:55:01,000
Part one of the Money Bomb.

3916
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:04,160
It ends with a long interview with Dr. Group.

3917
02:55:04,160 --> 02:55:09,680
Dr. Group runs the fourth hour of the show before they hand it off to whoever dumbass...

3918
02:55:09,680 --> 02:55:11,160
Maybe Joe Biggs, I'm not entirely sure.

3919
02:55:11,160 --> 02:55:12,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3920
02:55:12,160 --> 02:55:13,160
Who cares?

3921
02:55:13,160 --> 02:55:14,160
Yeah.

3922
02:55:14,160 --> 02:55:15,160
They keep the marathon going.

3923
02:55:15,160 --> 02:55:16,160
He's just trying to sell a lot of products.

3924
02:55:16,160 --> 02:55:17,160
He does a bunch of bullshit.

3925
02:55:17,160 --> 02:55:22,840
But before he leaves, before Alex leaves, he says that his predictions have never been

3926
02:55:22,840 --> 02:55:29,560
wrong, he's basically a psychic, and that his sixth sense is on fire like never before.

3927
02:55:29,560 --> 02:55:30,560
Race memory.

3928
02:55:30,560 --> 02:55:31,560
That's a quote.

3929
02:55:31,560 --> 02:55:33,840
My sixth sense is on fire like it's never been before.

3930
02:55:33,840 --> 02:55:36,840
First of all, I don't think you have a sixth sense.

3931
02:55:36,840 --> 02:55:37,840
Don't care.

3932
02:55:37,840 --> 02:55:41,440
I think that you are freaked out, certainly.

3933
02:55:41,440 --> 02:55:46,120
Then he had this quote that I thought was really fucking awesome, and it was, if you're

3934
02:55:46,120 --> 02:55:50,240
nouveau riche and you're not giving us money, or...

3935
02:55:50,240 --> 02:55:54,140
And then there's a long list of things basically that are just about giving him press, like

3936
02:55:54,140 --> 02:55:56,880
buying us a billboard, that sort of thing.

3937
02:55:56,880 --> 02:55:59,060
You're crazy.

3938
02:55:59,060 --> 02:56:03,200
If you're nouveau riche, is that the way he phrases it, like alright.

3939
02:56:03,200 --> 02:56:06,040
Because he wants to delineate between people who have money...

3940
02:56:06,040 --> 02:56:07,040
It's not old money.

3941
02:56:07,040 --> 02:56:08,040
It's not old money.

3942
02:56:08,040 --> 02:56:12,780
It's the new, it's the dot-com billionaires who he's really courting.

3943
02:56:12,780 --> 02:56:16,500
So now, here's where things get really fun.

3944
02:56:16,500 --> 02:56:17,500
Where is that?

3945
02:56:17,500 --> 02:56:25,240
Larry Jones did his show on September 16th, then he was due to come back from 10-11pm

3946
02:56:25,240 --> 02:56:27,800
to do an interview with Larry Nichols.

3947
02:56:27,800 --> 02:56:34,640
They were going to do an hour-long interview, and then they were going to premiere a documentary.

3948
02:56:34,640 --> 02:56:40,240
He sent people down to tape Larry Nichols at his house, whose address has been given

3949
02:56:40,240 --> 02:56:43,040
out on our show.

3950
02:56:43,040 --> 02:56:45,400
And his phone number, if you'd like to call him, please.

3951
02:56:45,400 --> 02:56:46,740
I think we blocked that out.

3952
02:56:46,740 --> 02:56:52,120
He's emailknowledgefight.com, and I will fucking give you his phone number, I don't give a

3953
02:56:52,120 --> 02:56:53,120
shit.

3954
02:56:53,120 --> 02:56:54,120
He gave it out on air!

3955
02:56:54,120 --> 02:56:55,120
He did.

3956
02:56:55,120 --> 02:56:56,120
And it's still on the internet.

3957
02:56:56,120 --> 02:56:57,960
On Alex Jones' channel.

3958
02:56:57,960 --> 02:57:02,280
But be that as it may, they sent them out there, they made a documentary, and Alex was

3959
02:57:02,280 --> 02:57:08,280
going to do an hour-long interview with Larry to, like, precede it.

3960
02:57:08,280 --> 02:57:11,940
Larry clearly didn't answer the phone.

3961
02:57:11,940 --> 02:57:12,940
Because the first half...

3962
02:57:12,940 --> 02:57:13,940
On purpose?

3963
02:57:13,940 --> 02:57:14,940
I think he was asleep.

3964
02:57:14,940 --> 02:57:19,760
The first half hour of the show is Alex Jones vamping like hell.

3965
02:57:19,760 --> 02:57:23,960
He's just talking about, like, my early days on radio were great.

3966
02:57:23,960 --> 02:57:28,280
It's just, like, it's so much filler for, like, the first 25 minutes of the hour.

3967
02:57:28,280 --> 02:57:29,720
There are two kinds of people.

3968
02:57:29,720 --> 02:57:32,600
People on the radio, and then people not on the radio.

3969
02:57:32,600 --> 02:57:37,320
What he's trying to do is he's trying to say things without getting into anything that

3970
02:57:37,320 --> 02:57:40,840
he can't bail from if Larry gets on the phone at any point.

3971
02:57:40,840 --> 02:57:41,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3972
02:57:41,840 --> 02:57:45,240
And then that, like, that maintenance, like, let's, uh...

3973
02:57:45,240 --> 02:57:46,240
Yeah.

3974
02:57:46,240 --> 02:57:47,240
He's stretching.

3975
02:57:47,240 --> 02:57:48,240
Yeah, exactly.

3976
02:57:48,240 --> 02:57:53,920
And so about 25 minutes or so, 30 minutes in, Larry Nichols finally gets on the phone,

3977
02:57:53,920 --> 02:57:58,860
and they just talk about how much Hillary sucks, of course, because that's his bread

3978
02:57:58,860 --> 02:57:59,860
and butter.

3979
02:57:59,860 --> 02:58:04,720
And Larry Nichols drops this chestnut.

3980
02:58:04,720 --> 02:58:10,440
What Hillary needs to do, and what she's going to do, is she's going to make herself the

3981
02:58:10,440 --> 02:58:11,920
underdog.

3982
02:58:11,920 --> 02:58:17,680
That's why she released all this information about the servers.

3983
02:58:17,680 --> 02:58:18,680
Wait.

3984
02:58:18,680 --> 02:58:24,160
Hillary released her own, the information about the servers herself?

3985
02:58:24,160 --> 02:58:28,600
Yes, yes, because she needs to make herself the underdog, which is out of Larry Nichols'

3986
02:58:28,600 --> 02:58:32,760
playbook from way back in the Arkansas days.

3987
02:58:32,760 --> 02:58:36,040
They had to make Bill Clinton an underdog in order to make, because everyone loves an

3988
02:58:36,040 --> 02:58:37,040
underdog.

3989
02:58:37,040 --> 02:58:38,920
But Bill Clinton was the underdog.

3990
02:58:38,920 --> 02:58:39,920
Right.

3991
02:58:39,920 --> 02:58:40,920
That's nonsense.

3992
02:58:40,920 --> 02:58:41,920
Okay.

3993
02:58:41,920 --> 02:58:45,520
It's all, and if you actually look at Larry Nichols' actual history with the Clintons,

3994
02:58:45,520 --> 02:58:46,520
it doesn't...

3995
02:58:46,520 --> 02:58:48,760
No, that doesn't scan at all.

3996
02:58:48,760 --> 02:58:52,000
He wasn't involved with any of the stuff he says he was involved with.

3997
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:53,000
No.

3998
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:58,000
So that's his big sort of selling point, is that she did all this shit to herself, because

3999
02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:00,640
the Clintons and the Bushes are dynastic families.

4000
02:59:00,640 --> 02:59:03,980
They're always going to be at the top, so they have to make themselves the underdogs

4001
02:59:03,980 --> 02:59:06,480
in order for you to kind of care about them.

4002
02:59:06,480 --> 02:59:14,180
So he goes on to say, these next two things on the show that are dumb...

4003
02:59:14,180 --> 02:59:18,160
They only have 20 minutes or so to do their interview before they scream at you.

4004
02:59:18,160 --> 02:59:20,520
Yeah, because they've already bailed on so many hours.

4005
02:59:20,520 --> 02:59:26,700
And they spend 10 minutes of it with Alex Jones vamping more, because Larry Nichols

4006
02:59:26,700 --> 02:59:28,400
has to take his dog out to shit.

4007
02:59:28,400 --> 02:59:29,400
Oh!

4008
02:59:29,400 --> 02:59:30,400
It's crazy.

4009
02:59:30,400 --> 02:59:31,400
That's cute.

4010
02:59:31,400 --> 02:59:34,560
It's humanizing in some ways, but it's terrible radio.

4011
02:59:34,560 --> 02:59:35,560
It's terrible.

4012
02:59:35,560 --> 02:59:36,960
And Hitler's dog loved him.

4013
02:59:36,960 --> 02:59:37,960
Yeah.

4014
02:59:37,960 --> 02:59:41,960
But here is something that Larry Nichols predicts about Hillary that did not come true.

4015
02:59:41,960 --> 02:59:43,800
You said that first months ago.

4016
02:59:43,800 --> 02:59:49,040
Now it's in the news that Obama's after Hillary, and she's even attacking Obama now.

4017
02:59:49,040 --> 02:59:52,360
Yeah, here's what you will watch.

4018
02:59:52,360 --> 02:59:54,100
Here's what's coming.

4019
02:59:54,100 --> 02:59:58,600
They're following our playbook this time exactly, Alex.

4020
02:59:58,600 --> 03:00:00,920
She's going to start the tearing to her.

4021
03:00:00,920 --> 03:00:04,520
Now when Hillary goes out, she's going to tear up.

4022
03:00:04,520 --> 03:00:06,440
So that's misogynistic as fuck.

4023
03:00:06,440 --> 03:00:09,480
Now when Hillary goes out, she's going to tear up.

4024
03:00:09,480 --> 03:00:10,480
She's going to start crying.

4025
03:00:10,480 --> 03:00:13,800
She's going to start crying, because everybody respects a woman who cries.

4026
03:00:13,800 --> 03:00:14,800
Sure.

4027
03:00:14,800 --> 03:00:17,360
Everybody's going to be like, oh, this woman cries?

4028
03:00:17,360 --> 03:00:19,460
That makes me want her to be president.

4029
03:00:19,460 --> 03:00:25,280
There's no inherent misogyny behind a woman crying that, oh, fuck off.

4030
03:00:25,280 --> 03:00:26,740
Fuck you, Larry Nichols.

4031
03:00:26,740 --> 03:00:30,740
In the same way that Alex always complains that like, hey, you call me racist, and that's

4032
03:00:30,740 --> 03:00:32,400
your way of taking my power.

4033
03:00:32,400 --> 03:00:36,920
She believes that a woman starts crying, and now I've got to be chivalrous.

4034
03:00:36,920 --> 03:00:38,360
It's that same thing.

4035
03:00:38,360 --> 03:00:39,720
It's a load of bullshit.

4036
03:00:39,720 --> 03:00:43,660
Also, Hillary Clinton, say what you want about her, did not cry.

4037
03:00:43,660 --> 03:00:47,560
She came out and defended herself quite admirably.

4038
03:00:47,560 --> 03:00:48,560
No.

4039
03:00:48,560 --> 03:00:52,260
So, whatever Larry Nichols' idea.

4040
03:00:52,260 --> 03:00:55,280
Say whatever you want about Hillary's campaign.

4041
03:00:55,280 --> 03:00:56,920
Hillary fucking brought it.

4042
03:00:56,920 --> 03:00:58,200
You've got to give her that.

4043
03:00:58,200 --> 03:01:04,640
And she stood up to these attacks and didn't, I mean, she apologized for things that you

4044
03:01:04,640 --> 03:01:08,120
thought was like maybe an error in judgment, those sorts of things.

4045
03:01:08,120 --> 03:01:10,320
Yeah, the super predator shit.

4046
03:01:10,320 --> 03:01:11,320
Bad.

4047
03:01:11,320 --> 03:01:12,320
Yeah.

4048
03:01:12,320 --> 03:01:18,520
But didn't back down to this right wing conspiracy that mostly tracks back to Larry Nichols.

4049
03:01:18,520 --> 03:01:19,520
Yeah, exactly.

4050
03:01:19,520 --> 03:01:23,200
Like, Larry Nichols legitimately is such a problem in the world.

4051
03:01:23,200 --> 03:01:24,760
He's so terrible.

4052
03:01:24,760 --> 03:01:25,760
Wow.

4053
03:01:25,760 --> 03:01:31,120
And as much as he is a problem in terms of all the stuff he's done with the Clintons,

4054
03:01:31,120 --> 03:01:33,520
he's a huge problem in general.

4055
03:01:33,520 --> 03:01:37,760
Like I know he, we've talked about this, he was saying that Obama wants to become the

4056
03:01:37,760 --> 03:01:41,520
last president, because then he becomes king.

4057
03:01:41,520 --> 03:01:46,280
Like the Patton Oswalt bit about Bush, where he wants to become the last president.

4058
03:01:46,280 --> 03:01:48,160
Right, but he's not doing comedy.

4059
03:01:48,160 --> 03:01:50,760
Yeah, no, he's not very funny about this at all.

4060
03:01:50,760 --> 03:01:55,680
He will become the king, and then once he's the king, yes, he becomes the king of the

4061
03:01:55,680 --> 03:01:56,680
Muslims.

4062
03:01:56,680 --> 03:01:57,680
Yes.

4063
03:01:57,680 --> 03:01:58,680
Now...

4064
03:01:58,680 --> 03:01:59,680
Which will never stop.

4065
03:01:59,680 --> 03:02:00,680
That's funny.

4066
03:02:00,680 --> 03:02:01,680
That will never not make me laugh.

4067
03:02:01,680 --> 03:02:02,680
That's funny.

4068
03:02:02,680 --> 03:02:03,680
The king of the Muslims!

4069
03:02:03,680 --> 03:02:04,680
That's funny.

4070
03:02:04,680 --> 03:02:05,680
Yeah.

4071
03:02:05,680 --> 03:02:11,920
But, listen to this next clip of Larry Nichols, and realize how much he fucking hates Muslims,

4072
03:02:11,920 --> 03:02:13,680
and realize...

4073
03:02:13,680 --> 03:02:15,280
This is Nichols hating...

4074
03:02:15,280 --> 03:02:16,280
Yeah.

4075
03:02:16,280 --> 03:02:17,280
Okay.

4076
03:02:17,280 --> 03:02:18,280
This is no longer funny.

4077
03:02:18,280 --> 03:02:19,280
Alright.

4078
03:02:19,280 --> 03:02:20,280
I just can't believe it.

4079
03:02:20,280 --> 03:02:23,600
I just can't believe what, I mean, what type of psycho scum... you've been around these

4080
03:02:23,600 --> 03:02:26,320
people, but I mean, they weren't even that bad back then.

4081
03:02:26,320 --> 03:02:28,320
Have they gone crazy?

4082
03:02:28,320 --> 03:02:33,520
In my day, bad guys would look good today.

4083
03:02:33,520 --> 03:02:40,160
Bad guys back then, honestly, Alex, would be heroes today, if you can believe that.

4084
03:02:40,160 --> 03:02:45,400
Remember this term, Akbar El-Amin, Akbar El-Amin.

4085
03:02:45,400 --> 03:02:51,840
And what they're doing with this flood of immigrants that are going all over Europe,

4086
03:02:51,840 --> 03:02:53,760
it's the spread.

4087
03:02:53,760 --> 03:02:54,760
They're moving in.

4088
03:02:54,760 --> 03:02:56,240
They're setting up Caliphates, buddy.

4089
03:02:56,240 --> 03:03:00,600
Akbar El-Amin is when they spread, when they spread and they get into more...

4090
03:03:00,600 --> 03:03:03,840
You know, the first one comes in, well, gosh, he's a great little Muslim.

4091
03:03:03,840 --> 03:03:04,840
You know what?

4092
03:03:04,840 --> 03:03:06,740
They're just really nice people.

4093
03:03:06,740 --> 03:03:08,240
We could probably let another one in.

4094
03:03:08,240 --> 03:03:09,920
Well, then, in comes another one.

4095
03:03:09,920 --> 03:03:13,280
Well, you know, they're just really nice people.

4096
03:03:13,280 --> 03:03:14,720
But read the Quran, folks.

4097
03:03:14,720 --> 03:03:20,760
One day, every Muslim, one day, is gonna come to what they call the river of the bad.

4098
03:03:20,760 --> 03:03:24,820
You get more lung cancer, you fucking pile of garbage?

4099
03:03:24,820 --> 03:03:28,520
Three times in the Quran, it says, peace, love, dope.

4100
03:03:28,520 --> 03:03:29,520
You got it?

4101
03:03:29,520 --> 03:03:30,520
Three times.

4102
03:03:30,520 --> 03:03:37,160
Seventy some odd times, it says, try to convert to infidel.

4103
03:03:37,160 --> 03:03:38,160
Three times.

4104
03:03:38,160 --> 03:03:40,800
Oh my fucking God, read the Bible, you pile of...

4105
03:03:40,800 --> 03:03:41,800
Fuck you.

4106
03:03:41,800 --> 03:03:42,800
Fuck you.

4107
03:03:42,800 --> 03:03:45,520
Look what they did in Africa, Alex.

4108
03:03:45,520 --> 03:03:47,520
Convert to Islam or die.

4109
03:03:47,520 --> 03:03:49,400
Look at what Christians did to Africa.

4110
03:03:49,400 --> 03:03:53,040
We can't grow Christianity by saying either you believe in Jesus Christ or we're gonna

4111
03:03:53,040 --> 03:03:54,040
cut you at all.

4112
03:03:54,040 --> 03:03:55,040
Crusades.

4113
03:03:55,040 --> 03:03:56,040
They're growing.

4114
03:03:56,040 --> 03:03:57,040
Fucking, wow.

4115
03:03:57,040 --> 03:03:59,040
We in America have become cowards.

4116
03:03:59,040 --> 03:04:00,960
What are we gonna do now?

4117
03:04:00,960 --> 03:04:04,440
Why are you being racist against people saying I'm gonna kill you if you don't convert to

4118
03:04:04,440 --> 03:04:05,440
my religion?

4119
03:04:05,440 --> 03:04:06,440
That's liberal and crazy.

4120
03:04:06,440 --> 03:04:07,440
That's actually a really good question.

4121
03:04:07,440 --> 03:04:08,440
I can't help it.

4122
03:04:08,440 --> 03:04:09,440
I know, but I just can't help it.

4123
03:04:09,440 --> 03:04:10,440
Let me ask you this, Alex.

4124
03:04:10,440 --> 03:04:11,840
I'm gonna pose this question for you.

4125
03:04:11,840 --> 03:04:16,480
Dearborn, Michigan, you know, has got a huge population of Muslims.

4126
03:04:16,480 --> 03:04:19,680
They even do that little wacky thing, you know, every time of the day where they do

4127
03:04:19,680 --> 03:04:22,200
the prayer out on the loudspeaker.

4128
03:04:22,200 --> 03:04:23,200
The wacky...

4129
03:04:23,200 --> 03:04:29,620
Tell me exactly what would happen, Alex, if tomorrow morning we wake up in Dearborn, Michigan,

4130
03:04:29,620 --> 03:04:33,840
the Muslim community there declares itself a caliphate.

4131
03:04:33,840 --> 03:04:37,040
Now, what would happen?

4132
03:04:37,040 --> 03:04:40,440
They would say it's religious freedom to have that area of Michigan be under Islamic rule

4133
03:04:40,440 --> 03:04:45,320
and the government would submit to it and the left is promoting it.

4134
03:04:45,320 --> 03:04:47,160
There's no way, folks.

4135
03:04:47,160 --> 03:04:52,840
Do you really believe we would take our government in, Alex, and drive them out of there?

4136
03:04:52,840 --> 03:04:53,840
Yeah, probably.

4137
03:04:53,840 --> 03:04:57,840
I assume if it was like an insurrection of some sort.

4138
03:04:57,840 --> 03:04:58,840
I imagine.

4139
03:04:58,840 --> 03:05:05,760
We put down the whiskey rebellion with force.

4140
03:05:05,760 --> 03:05:10,320
It's not like we're new to the National Guard coming in to murder people.

4141
03:05:10,320 --> 03:05:11,320
Yeah.

4142
03:05:11,320 --> 03:05:16,960
But if we don't murder them out of the equation, the government did what it had to do with

4143
03:05:16,960 --> 03:05:20,760
the Bundy Ranch and that wildlife preserve.

4144
03:05:20,760 --> 03:05:25,000
They did it admirably without killing anybody, except for that one guy.

4145
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:27,040
They killed that one guy, but he had it coming.

4146
03:05:27,040 --> 03:05:32,560
When you say admirably, you suggest that it's admirable that they didn't all die.

4147
03:05:32,560 --> 03:05:33,560
So much...

4148
03:05:33,560 --> 03:05:36,560
Now, I respect you for that opinion.

4149
03:05:36,560 --> 03:05:41,840
Hypothetical means a lot of restraint because...

4150
03:05:41,840 --> 03:05:47,560
The restraint I wish they afforded all other people that are white.

4151
03:05:47,560 --> 03:05:48,560
Right.

4152
03:05:48,560 --> 03:05:50,040
I 100% agree with that.

4153
03:05:50,040 --> 03:05:54,240
But his presentation of it like, what if they just declared a caliphate?

4154
03:05:54,240 --> 03:05:59,120
Like, well, that's a fun hypothetical, first of all, not happening.

4155
03:05:59,120 --> 03:06:02,240
Second of all, if it did, of course that wouldn't fly.

4156
03:06:02,240 --> 03:06:08,200
What if our country just broke into another and just declared a Christian nation?

4157
03:06:08,200 --> 03:06:10,480
What kind of monsters would we be?

4158
03:06:10,480 --> 03:06:17,360
Or what if, let's say, Dearborn, Michigan had a huge Christian population and they decided

4159
03:06:17,360 --> 03:06:23,760
we are going to be now a completely theocratic Christian city.

4160
03:06:23,760 --> 03:06:27,480
Oh, do you mean just Dearborn?

4161
03:06:27,480 --> 03:06:28,480
A lot of cities.

4162
03:06:28,480 --> 03:06:29,480
I don't know.

4163
03:06:29,480 --> 03:06:30,480
Oh, man.

4164
03:06:30,480 --> 03:06:32,480
How can...

4165
03:06:32,480 --> 03:06:36,280
I keep saying how can.

4166
03:06:36,280 --> 03:06:42,440
I keep saying how can, as if I don't get that the concept behind this is just...

4167
03:06:42,440 --> 03:06:47,120
You're like that girl on Clueless, like, as if.

4168
03:06:47,120 --> 03:06:54,240
I just genuinely believe that human beings are capable of some kind of rational thought,

4169
03:06:54,240 --> 03:06:56,400
and I'm consistently proven wrong.

4170
03:06:56,400 --> 03:07:00,920
And the worst part is I'm consistently proven wrong in the same fucking episode.

4171
03:07:00,920 --> 03:07:01,920
Yeah.

4172
03:07:01,920 --> 03:07:02,920
Yeah.

4173
03:07:02,920 --> 03:07:04,920
There's no rationality here.

4174
03:07:04,920 --> 03:07:06,640
So it's nuts.

4175
03:07:06,640 --> 03:07:10,800
Larry Nichols says a bunch of dumbass bullshit, as he's known to do on the streets.

4176
03:07:10,800 --> 03:07:12,040
As is his want.

4177
03:07:12,040 --> 03:07:13,040
Yeah.

4178
03:07:13,040 --> 03:07:14,040
And then they play...

4179
03:07:14,040 --> 03:07:16,320
On the streets, like he's in The Wire.

4180
03:07:16,320 --> 03:07:17,320
Yeah.

4181
03:07:17,320 --> 03:07:18,320
He's Marlowe out there.

4182
03:07:18,320 --> 03:07:19,320
Yeah.

4183
03:07:19,320 --> 03:07:20,800
My name is my name.

4184
03:07:20,800 --> 03:07:25,400
So Larry Nichols then, they play the documentary, and I don't have any clips of it because who

4185
03:07:25,400 --> 03:07:26,400
gives a fuck?

4186
03:07:26,400 --> 03:07:27,400
But, uh...

4187
03:07:27,400 --> 03:07:28,400
They actually...

4188
03:07:28,400 --> 03:07:29,400
Okay.

4189
03:07:29,400 --> 03:07:35,640
It's just him talking about how, like, now Hillary, she is not going to be taken down

4190
03:07:35,640 --> 03:07:37,640
by Benghazi stuff.

4191
03:07:37,640 --> 03:07:38,640
She's slippery.

4192
03:07:38,640 --> 03:07:43,200
But what's gonna take her down is the documents I have about Vince Foster's murder.

4193
03:07:43,200 --> 03:07:44,720
Oh, man.

4194
03:07:44,720 --> 03:07:51,320
Which we have already covered him saying that the document that he has about Vince Foster's

4195
03:07:51,320 --> 03:07:55,160
murder just miraculously showed up in his mailbox.

4196
03:07:55,160 --> 03:07:56,160
It's crazy.

4197
03:07:56,160 --> 03:07:57,160
Yeah.

4198
03:07:57,160 --> 03:07:58,160
It showed up in his mail.

4199
03:07:58,160 --> 03:07:59,160
He has no idea.

4200
03:07:59,160 --> 03:08:03,160
He gave out his address, and then the document proving, uh, Vince Foster was killed, I gave

4201
03:08:03,160 --> 03:08:04,160
out his mail.

4202
03:08:04,160 --> 03:08:05,160
Yeah.

4203
03:08:05,160 --> 03:08:06,160
No, but no.

4204
03:08:06,160 --> 03:08:09,720
Maybe someone falsified that based on how you keep going on right-wing radio shows.

4205
03:08:09,720 --> 03:08:10,720
Uh-uh.

4206
03:08:10,720 --> 03:08:11,720
Yeah.

4207
03:08:11,720 --> 03:08:13,120
I got a Twitter DM saying it was true.

4208
03:08:13,120 --> 03:08:14,120
Yep.

4209
03:08:14,120 --> 03:08:15,120
That's Paul Joseph Watson style.

4210
03:08:15,120 --> 03:08:16,120
There we go.

4211
03:08:16,120 --> 03:08:17,120
So, like, it is that.

4212
03:08:17,120 --> 03:08:18,120
And he's just like, ah.

4213
03:08:18,120 --> 03:08:23,520
But there's one moment of true comedy where he talks about how, I used to be a bad man.

4214
03:08:23,520 --> 03:08:29,080
I was involved with the Clintons, and then my dad got lung cancer.

4215
03:08:29,080 --> 03:08:36,960
And while he's talking about that, the video is him smoking a cigarette on his porch.

4216
03:08:36,960 --> 03:08:39,840
I don't know why he got lung cancer.

4217
03:08:39,840 --> 03:08:42,760
It's probably some globalist plot.

4218
03:08:42,760 --> 03:08:45,080
They have cures for lung cancer, don't they?

4219
03:08:45,080 --> 03:08:50,560
His life-changing moment that he's describing is brought on by the thing he's doing in the

4220
03:08:50,560 --> 03:08:51,560
video.

4221
03:08:51,560 --> 03:08:52,560
It's crazy.

4222
03:08:52,560 --> 03:08:55,000
Like, I couldn't be involved with these Clintons anymore.

4223
03:08:55,000 --> 03:08:59,200
What about the drugs they brought in my daughter was doing?

4224
03:08:59,200 --> 03:09:03,960
So was it, like, with Larry Nichols, was it really just him kind of getting fucked over

4225
03:09:03,960 --> 03:09:05,600
and then realize that he had it?

4226
03:09:05,600 --> 03:09:06,600
He got fired.

4227
03:09:06,600 --> 03:09:12,440
Yeah, but then he just realized he had a gig just talking shit about the Clintons?

4228
03:09:12,440 --> 03:09:13,440
I don't think.

4229
03:09:13,440 --> 03:09:15,440
Like, that was the genesis of so much horrific.

4230
03:09:15,440 --> 03:09:18,480
I don't think he had any idea how well this was gonna work out.

4231
03:09:18,480 --> 03:09:19,480
Oh, that's possible.

4232
03:09:19,480 --> 03:09:25,680
I think he was a bitter, vindictive dude who was a piece of shit, and was involved—

4233
03:09:25,680 --> 03:09:26,680
Was?

4234
03:09:26,680 --> 03:09:28,400
Is a piece of shit.

4235
03:09:28,400 --> 03:09:29,800
He was involved with—

4236
03:09:29,800 --> 03:09:32,360
Until he dies, and we are gonna call him on that day.

4237
03:09:32,360 --> 03:09:38,160
And I'm not entirely sure what the circumstances were, but he was involved with the Contras.

4238
03:09:38,160 --> 03:09:39,160
Yeah.

4239
03:09:39,160 --> 03:09:42,200
Like, he was involved with, like, Ollie North and all them.

4240
03:09:42,200 --> 03:09:44,680
That's why he got fired from Clinton's White House.

4241
03:09:44,680 --> 03:09:46,160
Oh, do you mean legitimately?

4242
03:09:46,160 --> 03:09:47,160
Yeah.

4243
03:09:47,160 --> 03:09:48,160
Crazy.

4244
03:09:48,160 --> 03:09:54,720
He was involved in collecting collect calls and shit like that to Nicaragua.

4245
03:09:54,720 --> 03:09:59,160
And that's why he ended up getting fired, because it was a completely traceable thing.

4246
03:09:59,160 --> 03:10:04,400
We have a call for you from Larry Nichols.

4247
03:10:04,400 --> 03:10:05,840
Will you accept the charges?

4248
03:10:05,840 --> 03:10:06,840
Hang up.

4249
03:10:06,840 --> 03:10:07,840
Hang up.

4250
03:10:07,840 --> 03:10:08,840
No.

4251
03:10:08,840 --> 03:10:10,480
He's just gonna complain about his dog shitting.

4252
03:10:10,480 --> 03:10:11,480
But like, that is—

4253
03:10:11,480 --> 03:10:13,200
This motherfucker has loon kings here.

4254
03:10:13,200 --> 03:10:14,200
Come on, man.

4255
03:10:14,200 --> 03:10:18,240
He was involved as a functionary, like he was hired in some way.

4256
03:10:18,240 --> 03:10:22,240
I'm not entirely sure what other connections he had at that point.

4257
03:10:22,240 --> 03:10:24,440
That's very difficult to trace.

4258
03:10:24,440 --> 03:10:31,200
But he got fired, he blamed Bill for it, and then created this elaborate backstory that

4259
03:10:31,200 --> 03:10:35,440
has been shown to be mostly false repeatedly.

4260
03:10:35,440 --> 03:10:37,520
On so many, so many levels.

4261
03:10:37,520 --> 03:10:40,520
Again, we've talked about this a bunch, but it bears repeating if you haven't listened

4262
03:10:40,520 --> 03:10:42,000
to all of our episodes.

4263
03:10:42,000 --> 03:10:47,240
He was on a right-wing radio show and claimed to be an assassin who killed people for hire

4264
03:10:47,240 --> 03:10:48,360
for the Clintons.

4265
03:10:48,360 --> 03:10:50,100
He was their hired assassin.

4266
03:10:50,100 --> 03:10:56,000
He said that on a radio show, and then when asked about it said, I was high on pills when

4267
03:10:56,000 --> 03:10:57,000
I was on that show.

4268
03:10:57,000 --> 03:10:58,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4269
03:10:58,000 --> 03:11:00,520
I didn't mean to say that, I never would have said that.

4270
03:11:00,520 --> 03:11:02,880
That's the kind of person we're talking about.

4271
03:11:02,880 --> 03:11:08,120
Once again, important to note, Vince Foster killed himself.

4272
03:11:08,120 --> 03:11:09,680
It was not a murder.

4273
03:11:09,680 --> 03:11:10,680
Yeah.

4274
03:11:10,680 --> 03:11:16,120
The reason that most people think it's a murder is because of this document that just mysteriously

4275
03:11:16,120 --> 03:11:20,320
showed up in Larry Nichols' mailbox.

4276
03:11:20,320 --> 03:11:22,280
And fucking Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity.

4277
03:11:22,280 --> 03:11:25,200
But a lot of that is from Larry Nichols' stuff.

4278
03:11:25,200 --> 03:11:26,200
Yeah.

4279
03:11:26,200 --> 03:11:27,200
Yeah.

4280
03:11:27,200 --> 03:11:28,200
No, exactly.

4281
03:11:28,200 --> 03:11:29,200
They were the ones who publicized it.

4282
03:11:29,200 --> 03:11:30,200
But what they cite is shit.

4283
03:11:30,200 --> 03:11:32,360
They were the judge report of their time.

4284
03:11:32,360 --> 03:11:33,360
Yes.

4285
03:11:33,360 --> 03:11:34,360
Yeah.

4286
03:11:34,360 --> 03:11:39,240
But the idea that his body was moved, all that stuff.

4287
03:11:39,240 --> 03:11:44,040
The Clintons forced the Park Department to take the murder investigation instead of the

4288
03:11:44,040 --> 03:11:45,160
FBI.

4289
03:11:45,160 --> 03:11:47,480
All that stuff comes from Larry Nichols.

4290
03:11:47,480 --> 03:11:48,480
Sure.

4291
03:11:48,480 --> 03:11:49,880
And it's...

4292
03:11:49,880 --> 03:11:55,360
I've seen the document that Larry Nichols has, like they've played it on the Alex Jones

4293
03:11:55,360 --> 03:11:56,360
show.

4294
03:11:56,360 --> 03:11:57,360
It's crazy that it was written in crayon.

4295
03:11:57,360 --> 03:11:58,360
Yeah.

4296
03:11:58,360 --> 03:11:59,720
It's really ludicrous.

4297
03:11:59,720 --> 03:12:01,160
It might as well have been.

4298
03:12:01,160 --> 03:12:02,160
Yeah.

4299
03:12:02,160 --> 03:12:05,260
So anyway, that is the late night portion of the 16th.

4300
03:12:05,260 --> 03:12:06,480
Now we get to the 17th.

4301
03:12:06,480 --> 03:12:07,480
The Money Bomb.

4302
03:12:07,480 --> 03:12:08,480
The end of the Money Bomb.

4303
03:12:08,480 --> 03:12:09,480
The Money Bomb comes to a close.

4304
03:12:09,480 --> 03:12:12,800
We are now about 24 hours into the Money Bomb.

4305
03:12:12,800 --> 03:12:13,800
Jesus.

4306
03:12:13,800 --> 03:12:16,480
And Alex Jones is trying to raise a million dollars.

4307
03:12:16,480 --> 03:12:20,480
What kind of lunatic would watch this much Info Wars?

4308
03:12:20,480 --> 03:12:21,480
You're looking at him.

4309
03:12:21,480 --> 03:12:22,480
Fair.

4310
03:12:22,480 --> 03:12:25,560
You don't even watch the David Knight parts.

4311
03:12:25,560 --> 03:12:26,560
Come on.

4312
03:12:26,560 --> 03:12:27,560
No.

4313
03:12:27,560 --> 03:12:28,560
Like, I understand the idea of...

4314
03:12:28,560 --> 03:12:31,680
If you're talking about volume, I've watched it.

4315
03:12:31,680 --> 03:12:32,680
Yeah, that's true.

4316
03:12:32,680 --> 03:12:34,840
But I'm not gonna watch when the side characters are involved.

4317
03:12:34,840 --> 03:12:36,320
They're terrible.

4318
03:12:36,320 --> 03:12:39,600
But why would you do this...

4319
03:12:39,600 --> 03:12:46,560
I just don't understand what it is they think is going to happen if you do a 27 hour show

4320
03:12:46,560 --> 03:12:49,200
versus a four hour show.

4321
03:12:49,200 --> 03:12:50,200
Like who's watching...

4322
03:12:50,200 --> 03:12:52,200
Can I explain?

4323
03:12:52,200 --> 03:12:53,920
Actually yes, please.

4324
03:12:53,920 --> 03:12:54,920
So much.

4325
03:12:54,920 --> 03:12:58,840
Alex Jones knows full well that the only times they're going to be making money are during

4326
03:12:58,840 --> 03:13:00,440
his show.

4327
03:13:00,440 --> 03:13:03,360
But maybe we get a couple thousand.

4328
03:13:03,360 --> 03:13:05,920
Maybe we get a little bit of stragglers.

4329
03:13:05,920 --> 03:13:07,360
I don't have to do any fucking work.

4330
03:13:07,360 --> 03:13:08,880
Rob Doo is doing that work.

4331
03:13:08,880 --> 03:13:10,280
That's true.

4332
03:13:10,280 --> 03:13:11,280
They're doing it.

4333
03:13:11,280 --> 03:13:14,120
And there's a little bit of a stunt aspect to it.

4334
03:13:14,120 --> 03:13:18,320
Maybe some people will throw us a couple thousand dollars because of it and they're like a big

4335
03:13:18,320 --> 03:13:19,320
donation.

4336
03:13:19,320 --> 03:13:20,320
Yeah.

4337
03:13:20,320 --> 03:13:21,320
So there's that.

4338
03:13:21,320 --> 03:13:22,320
There's just...

4339
03:13:22,320 --> 03:13:26,960
We need to be a thinner net on the...

4340
03:13:26,960 --> 03:13:29,640
It's a drain and we gotta catch as much as we can.

4341
03:13:29,640 --> 03:13:31,220
We gotta tighten the drain.

4342
03:13:31,220 --> 03:13:33,320
We gotta make sure we're catching all that hair.

4343
03:13:33,320 --> 03:13:36,160
Now hair is not what you want, but that hair is money in this metaphor.

4344
03:13:36,160 --> 03:13:39,840
So you gotta catch all of it.

4345
03:13:39,840 --> 03:13:40,880
I'm not thrilled with this.

4346
03:13:40,880 --> 03:13:41,880
I love it.

4347
03:13:41,880 --> 03:13:42,880
I love it.

4348
03:13:42,880 --> 03:13:44,440
But you're crushing it so far.

4349
03:13:44,440 --> 03:13:45,440
Keep on going.

4350
03:13:45,440 --> 03:13:49,720
It's the difference between using a thick or thin comb.

4351
03:13:49,720 --> 03:13:51,020
It's just like fine comb.

4352
03:13:51,020 --> 03:13:54,160
We gotta get all the money out of this we can.

4353
03:13:54,160 --> 03:13:59,000
Whole day someone will tune in and maybe be like, all right, I love liberty.

4354
03:13:59,000 --> 03:14:00,000
Here's some money.

4355
03:14:00,000 --> 03:14:06,400
I just think of it in comparison to our usual...

4356
03:14:06,400 --> 03:14:11,680
Or like with Jimmy Pardo, the part cast-a-thon.

4357
03:14:11,680 --> 03:14:13,480
But exactly.

4358
03:14:13,480 --> 03:14:18,360
Their point though is we're going to continue to have a show.

4359
03:14:18,360 --> 03:14:21,280
This is going to be something we're going to have these different guests.

4360
03:14:21,280 --> 03:14:26,440
We're going to have all different types of things for you to tune into, even if you're

4361
03:14:26,440 --> 03:14:32,080
not interested for two hours, like, hey, maybe you're a big fan of Doug Benson or whatever.

4362
03:14:32,080 --> 03:14:33,080
Leo Zagami.

4363
03:14:33,080 --> 03:14:34,080
Yeah.

4364
03:14:34,080 --> 03:14:35,080
So you show up during this section.

4365
03:14:35,080 --> 03:14:37,720
He was great on podcast.

4366
03:14:37,720 --> 03:14:38,720
That would be amazing.

4367
03:14:38,720 --> 03:14:40,680
That would be amazing.

4368
03:14:40,680 --> 03:14:43,440
But that's the thing.

4369
03:14:43,440 --> 03:14:51,400
Other marathons have this kind of idea of like, we need to keep your attention.

4370
03:14:51,400 --> 03:14:52,400
And he doesn't.

4371
03:14:52,400 --> 03:14:53,400
Can I stop you?

4372
03:14:53,400 --> 03:14:54,400
Sure.

4373
03:14:54,400 --> 03:14:57,120
I'm going to do good will.

4374
03:14:57,120 --> 03:14:58,120
Fair.

4375
03:14:58,120 --> 03:14:59,120
Fair.

4376
03:14:59,120 --> 03:15:03,120
Most marathons come from a place of we want to do good.

4377
03:15:03,120 --> 03:15:04,120
You're right.

4378
03:15:04,120 --> 03:15:05,120
You're right.

4379
03:15:05,120 --> 03:15:11,360
Most of the time what they're doing, if it's Jerry's Kids or a part cast-a-thon, they're

4380
03:15:11,360 --> 03:15:15,120
raising money for charity and they hope that things are entertaining.

4381
03:15:15,120 --> 03:15:19,160
And I've watched part cast-a-thon for years and boy, a lot of it is not entertaining.

4382
03:15:19,160 --> 03:15:20,160
True.

4383
03:15:20,160 --> 03:15:21,440
A lot of times it's a slog.

4384
03:15:21,440 --> 03:15:22,440
No argument.

4385
03:15:22,440 --> 03:15:24,040
With this, they don't give a fuck.

4386
03:15:24,040 --> 03:15:25,720
They don't really care.

4387
03:15:25,720 --> 03:15:28,400
It's just a crass marketing campaign.

4388
03:15:28,400 --> 03:15:31,100
It's not like this money is going to charity.

4389
03:15:31,100 --> 03:15:36,200
He's made it very clear the money is just going to the things we already do.

4390
03:15:36,200 --> 03:15:40,380
He's presenting it as things we're going to do in the future, but they already do.

4391
03:15:40,380 --> 03:15:43,400
It's just a fucking slapdash.

4392
03:15:43,400 --> 03:15:46,800
And he's not even offering mugs to people like NPR does.

4393
03:15:46,800 --> 03:15:50,640
So take that part out of it.

4394
03:15:50,640 --> 03:15:52,620
It's just madcap desperation.

4395
03:15:52,620 --> 03:16:01,200
So when he ended his show on the 16th, they had, you know, in the hundreds of thousands

4396
03:16:01,200 --> 03:16:03,440
of dollars raised.

4397
03:16:03,440 --> 03:16:06,320
They were pretty well on their way.

4398
03:16:06,320 --> 03:16:09,160
And here's where we start on the 17th.

4399
03:16:09,160 --> 03:16:11,880
Here's where the finances are on the beginning of the 17th.

4400
03:16:11,880 --> 03:16:16,400
We need about a million dollars to be able to not have to flog the advertising and really

4401
03:16:16,400 --> 03:16:18,360
push things hard to pay for this.

4402
03:16:18,360 --> 03:16:27,040
And $567,000, they're just about to update the graph there that shows it, has come in.

4403
03:16:27,040 --> 03:16:31,500
And the biggest money amount we ever had brought in about $650,000.

4404
03:16:31,500 --> 03:16:33,720
So I guess we're going to break our record today.

4405
03:16:33,720 --> 03:16:35,120
Oh, they just updated.

4406
03:16:35,120 --> 03:16:37,120
It's more than I thought.

4407
03:16:37,120 --> 03:16:45,560
$572,000, $197, so $572,197.

4408
03:16:45,560 --> 03:16:49,120
And so we've already reached the goal of the satellite to close captioning and have over

4409
03:16:49,120 --> 03:16:56,880
$170,000 towards crew, towards travel, towards camera folks, towards editing, towards research,

4410
03:16:56,880 --> 03:16:57,880
towards reporters.

4411
03:16:57,880 --> 03:16:58,880
Crew, research, cameras.

4412
03:16:58,880 --> 03:16:59,880
Research.

4413
03:16:59,880 --> 03:17:00,880
Research.

4414
03:17:00,880 --> 03:17:01,880
Come on.

4415
03:17:01,880 --> 03:17:02,880
Come on.

4416
03:17:02,880 --> 03:17:03,880
Yeah.

4417
03:17:03,880 --> 03:17:04,880
Come on.

4418
03:17:04,880 --> 03:17:05,880
Don't pretend you're doing that.

4419
03:17:05,880 --> 03:17:06,880
Come on.

4420
03:17:06,880 --> 03:17:09,720
But all the other stuff that he lists is stuff that he's already doing.

4421
03:17:09,720 --> 03:17:13,840
So like he's presenting it as, fuck, we're 24 hours in.

4422
03:17:13,840 --> 03:17:16,840
We have like $550,000.

4423
03:17:16,840 --> 03:17:18,840
We're not making this million.

4424
03:17:18,840 --> 03:17:24,360
I think there is a part of him that's realizing my audience is not as potent as I want because

4425
03:17:24,360 --> 03:17:29,760
a million dollars, he's been presenting it, this entire lead up to it as it's not that

4426
03:17:29,760 --> 03:17:30,760
much money.

4427
03:17:30,760 --> 03:17:32,600
We're trying to run a media operation.

4428
03:17:32,600 --> 03:17:33,700
It sounds like a lot.

4429
03:17:33,700 --> 03:17:35,000
It's not that much.

4430
03:17:35,000 --> 03:17:36,840
He's milking this stone.

4431
03:17:36,840 --> 03:17:39,080
He's trying to get blood out of this stone.

4432
03:17:39,080 --> 03:17:46,280
And all he's been able to do is, I'll tell you this, he ends with $700,000 or so right

4433
03:17:46,280 --> 03:17:49,840
around there, which is 300,000 short of their goal.

4434
03:17:49,840 --> 03:17:55,720
Now granted, they do make their goal later, days later, because they've just added all

4435
03:17:55,720 --> 03:18:01,000
of their sales that they've gotten from other stuff.

4436
03:18:01,000 --> 03:18:08,080
But the thing that I think is that at a certain point, he didn't need the money.

4437
03:18:08,080 --> 03:18:13,080
I guarantee that he needed half a million.

4438
03:18:13,080 --> 03:18:15,200
But he wanted a million.

4439
03:18:15,200 --> 03:18:20,600
And so it became a thing where now it's not about money, it's about pride.

4440
03:18:20,600 --> 03:18:22,260
It's about who am I?

4441
03:18:22,260 --> 03:18:24,600
It's about how much do I think I'm worth?

4442
03:18:24,600 --> 03:18:28,320
And that's why you can hear a little bit of deflation when he's talking about that.

4443
03:18:28,320 --> 03:18:30,180
He expected to wake up.

4444
03:18:30,180 --> 03:18:33,040
It's not desperation, it's deflation.

4445
03:18:33,040 --> 03:18:35,000
Exactly like, yeah, it's the word you said.

4446
03:18:35,000 --> 03:18:36,000
It's ego damage.

4447
03:18:36,000 --> 03:18:37,000
Yeah, exactly.

4448
03:18:37,000 --> 03:18:39,640
He expected to wake up and the goal be met.

4449
03:18:39,640 --> 03:18:43,780
He expected he'd do this show with Larry Nichols that aired that documentary that everyone

4450
03:18:43,780 --> 03:18:45,080
wants to see.

4451
03:18:45,080 --> 03:18:46,080
Everybody does.

4452
03:18:46,080 --> 03:18:47,080
Which is terrible.

4453
03:18:47,080 --> 03:18:49,120
Also, it's like 28, 30 minutes long.

4454
03:18:49,120 --> 03:18:50,120
It's a disaster.

4455
03:18:50,120 --> 03:18:51,900
Fuck, everyone should watch it though.

4456
03:18:51,900 --> 03:18:52,900
It's so bad.

4457
03:18:52,900 --> 03:18:54,900
It's 30 minutes long.

4458
03:18:54,900 --> 03:18:59,520
It's short, it's Larry Nichols smoking and telling bullshit.

4459
03:18:59,520 --> 03:19:06,200
But he expected, I'm gonna come in on this September 17th, the end of the money bomb,

4460
03:19:06,200 --> 03:19:11,680
and either it's going to be we're at 900,000 and we just gotta get the last push or we're

4461
03:19:11,680 --> 03:19:12,680
already there.

4462
03:19:12,680 --> 03:19:13,680
Or it's gonna be like one and a half million.

4463
03:19:13,680 --> 03:19:14,680
Right.

4464
03:19:14,680 --> 03:19:20,800
And we're gonna, I started this money bomb by saying we have 3.5 billion losers or 3.5

4465
03:19:20,800 --> 03:19:24,400
billion people we touch with our social media presence.

4466
03:19:24,400 --> 03:19:27,600
And I think he's starting to realize he ain't got shit.

4467
03:19:27,600 --> 03:19:28,600
Right.

4468
03:19:28,600 --> 03:19:32,480
Which goes back to what I was talking about with Joe Biggs, when he went there and did

4469
03:19:32,480 --> 03:19:37,920
the Superman with his Hillary for prison shirt, and everyone in the fucking arena there for

4470
03:19:37,920 --> 03:19:47,120
Trump recognized, oh shit, I think that my premise that the money bomb was when money

4471
03:19:47,120 --> 03:19:50,880
gets funneled in, I was wrong.

4472
03:19:50,880 --> 03:19:57,360
But I think the disaster, not disaster necessarily, I would love $500,000, $700,000, I would love

4473
03:19:57,360 --> 03:19:58,360
that.

4474
03:19:58,360 --> 03:20:06,160
But the disappointment of how potent his audience is compared to how glorious the reaction was

4475
03:20:06,160 --> 03:20:12,920
from this Trump audience, I think that those two things do meld in Alex's mind.

4476
03:20:12,920 --> 03:20:13,920
Okay.

4477
03:20:13,920 --> 03:20:14,920
Okay.

4478
03:20:14,920 --> 03:20:23,320
So you're seeing his money bomb as him recognizing the real extent of his power, which is 700

4479
03:20:23,320 --> 03:20:24,320
grand.

4480
03:20:24,320 --> 03:20:25,960
Which is not as good as he hoped.

4481
03:20:25,960 --> 03:20:35,160
And you see Joe Biggs showing up at a Trump rally as a like, there is a whole new world

4482
03:20:35,160 --> 03:20:36,160
right here.

4483
03:20:36,160 --> 03:20:37,160
There's an untapped audience.

4484
03:20:37,160 --> 03:20:40,160
That is a lot stronger than our 700 grand.

4485
03:20:40,160 --> 03:20:41,160
Yeah.

4486
03:20:41,160 --> 03:20:44,200
A lot of people love us for our weird bullshit that we're spitting.

4487
03:20:44,200 --> 03:20:47,200
But if we throw in this stuff on top of it.

4488
03:20:47,200 --> 03:20:48,800
They're into some other weird shit.

4489
03:20:48,800 --> 03:20:50,540
I think that's where we get into it.

4490
03:20:50,540 --> 03:20:56,400
He thinks he's throwing in the Trump people on top of it, as opposed to he's surrendering

4491
03:20:56,400 --> 03:20:58,080
to the Trump people.

4492
03:20:58,080 --> 03:20:59,680
I think that might be the beginning of it.

4493
03:20:59,680 --> 03:21:00,680
That's fascinating.

4494
03:21:00,680 --> 03:21:01,680
Yeah.

4495
03:21:01,680 --> 03:21:02,680
That's really interesting.

4496
03:21:02,680 --> 03:21:05,240
I'm not 100% sure, but as I've been listening to this...

4497
03:21:05,240 --> 03:21:09,440
I mean, at the fucking point we're at with this investigation, who the goddamn hell knows

4498
03:21:09,440 --> 03:21:10,440
what's going on?

4499
03:21:10,440 --> 03:21:11,440
I know.

4500
03:21:11,440 --> 03:21:13,880
Every single time I've been certain of something, I'm wrong.

4501
03:21:13,880 --> 03:21:14,880
Yeah.

4502
03:21:14,880 --> 03:21:15,880
No.

4503
03:21:15,880 --> 03:21:16,880
It's crazy.

4504
03:21:16,880 --> 03:21:17,880
Yeah.

4505
03:21:17,880 --> 03:21:18,880
There's no logic to this at all.

4506
03:21:18,880 --> 03:21:23,080
When I look at his back when he told Trump, he's a punk and shut your fat mouth.

4507
03:21:23,080 --> 03:21:24,080
Right.

4508
03:21:24,080 --> 03:21:25,080
When I heard that, I was like, holy fuck.

4509
03:21:25,080 --> 03:21:26,080
Right.

4510
03:21:26,080 --> 03:21:27,080
Maybe...

4511
03:21:27,080 --> 03:21:28,080
And...

4512
03:21:28,080 --> 03:21:33,400
When I heard that, I was like, well, maybe he never gets on the Trump train at all, forgetting

4513
03:21:33,400 --> 03:21:35,480
the world that we live in now.

4514
03:21:35,480 --> 03:21:39,400
When I heard that at work, I texted you.

4515
03:21:39,400 --> 03:21:42,000
I was like, this investigation is so fucked up.

4516
03:21:42,000 --> 03:21:43,000
Yeah.

4517
03:21:43,000 --> 03:21:44,000
I wanted to tell you that.

4518
03:21:44,000 --> 03:21:45,000
You couldn't.

4519
03:21:45,000 --> 03:21:46,880
I was like, how the fuck did he say...

4520
03:21:46,880 --> 03:21:49,120
Because of the constraints of the show.

4521
03:21:49,120 --> 03:21:51,480
Now, here's where shit gets interesting.

4522
03:21:51,480 --> 03:21:52,480
Yes.

4523
03:21:52,480 --> 03:21:55,440
The debate, the Republican debate was on the 16th.

4524
03:21:55,440 --> 03:21:56,440
The second one.

4525
03:21:56,440 --> 03:21:57,440
The night of the 16th.

4526
03:21:57,440 --> 03:21:58,440
Yeah.

4527
03:21:58,440 --> 03:22:01,920
And they did their mystery science theater debate thing on the 16th.

4528
03:22:01,920 --> 03:22:02,920
Alex was not a part of it.

4529
03:22:02,920 --> 03:22:05,280
Which I'm sure was hilarious.

4530
03:22:05,280 --> 03:22:06,280
So much funny.

4531
03:22:06,280 --> 03:22:07,280
So funny.

4532
03:22:07,280 --> 03:22:08,280
So funny.

4533
03:22:08,280 --> 03:22:09,280
Oh yeah.

4534
03:22:09,280 --> 03:22:10,280
Then...

4535
03:22:10,280 --> 03:22:13,840
They really took down Manos, the hands of fate.

4536
03:22:13,840 --> 03:22:16,080
Not libertarian enough.

4537
03:22:16,080 --> 03:22:21,120
So in the next day, Alex gets to respond to the debate stuff.

4538
03:22:21,120 --> 03:22:24,400
And so now we're going to enter a little bit of...

4539
03:22:24,400 --> 03:22:25,400
The Thunderdome.

4540
03:22:25,400 --> 03:22:26,960
A little bit of debate recap.

4541
03:22:26,960 --> 03:22:30,840
Here's Alex Jones giving some of the highlights of last night's debate.

4542
03:22:30,840 --> 03:22:31,840
Oh boy.

4543
03:22:31,840 --> 03:22:32,840
That's coming up.

4544
03:22:32,840 --> 03:22:36,640
Senator Cruz says Planned Parenthood, a criminal enterprise.

4545
03:22:36,640 --> 03:22:39,040
One of the best statements of the night.

4546
03:22:39,040 --> 03:22:40,980
Big props to Senator Cruz.

4547
03:22:40,980 --> 03:22:44,400
This is also based on all the Center for Medical Progress videos.

4548
03:22:44,400 --> 03:22:45,400
Of course.

4549
03:22:45,400 --> 03:22:46,400
Of course.

4550
03:22:46,400 --> 03:22:48,880
Ted Cruz is citing all those videos about selling baby parts.

4551
03:22:48,880 --> 03:22:53,800
I've cut out so much of Alex complaining about that stuff, because it's just so boring.

4552
03:22:53,800 --> 03:22:56,920
We don't need to cover it over and over again.

4553
03:22:56,920 --> 03:23:03,200
Anytime anybody references Cruz in the context of a phrase that doesn't end with, lost his

4554
03:23:03,200 --> 03:23:04,640
feet, I'm bummed.

4555
03:23:04,640 --> 03:23:09,600
But for the entire span that we've been covering, Alex has been complaining about those Center

4556
03:23:09,600 --> 03:23:11,440
for Medical Progress videos.

4557
03:23:11,440 --> 03:23:18,560
He is talking about how legally, legally, legally, they can take a baby out.

4558
03:23:18,560 --> 03:23:20,520
They can take a baby out, right?

4559
03:23:20,520 --> 03:23:21,640
A live baby?

4560
03:23:21,640 --> 03:23:22,640
Live baby.

4561
03:23:22,640 --> 03:23:23,640
Okay.

4562
03:23:23,640 --> 03:23:24,640
They drug the woman up.

4563
03:23:24,640 --> 03:23:25,640
What's the name?

4564
03:23:25,640 --> 03:23:26,640
Hold on.

4565
03:23:26,640 --> 03:23:30,600
They drug the woman up, and as long as the baby is touching the mother, they can cut

4566
03:23:30,600 --> 03:23:31,600
it up.

4567
03:23:31,600 --> 03:23:34,520
They can cut it up and take the organs.

4568
03:23:34,520 --> 03:23:36,600
But if the baby stops touching the mother-

4569
03:23:36,600 --> 03:23:37,600
No.

4570
03:23:37,600 --> 03:23:38,600
No, no, no, no, Dan.

4571
03:23:38,600 --> 03:23:39,600
No.

4572
03:23:39,600 --> 03:23:40,600
Yeah.

4573
03:23:40,600 --> 03:23:45,800
They refuse to even believe that even the most irrational of human beings would accept

4574
03:23:45,800 --> 03:23:47,480
that as a reasonable response.

4575
03:23:47,480 --> 03:23:49,440
Alex has been pitching that as a narrative.

4576
03:23:49,440 --> 03:23:50,440
It's crazy.

4577
03:23:50,440 --> 03:23:51,440
That can't be true.

4578
03:23:51,440 --> 03:23:54,600
So also, a couple days before this, before September 17th-

4579
03:23:54,600 --> 03:23:57,040
It's like a home base argument.

4580
03:23:57,040 --> 03:23:58,040
Yes.

4581
03:23:58,040 --> 03:23:59,040
Yes.

4582
03:23:59,040 --> 03:24:00,040
We're talking about home base.

4583
03:24:00,040 --> 03:24:02,040
We're talking about Red Rover situation.

4584
03:24:02,040 --> 03:24:03,040
Yep.

4585
03:24:03,040 --> 03:24:04,040
Okay.

4586
03:24:04,040 --> 03:24:05,040
All right.

4587
03:24:05,040 --> 03:24:06,040
Pudding up baby.

4588
03:24:06,040 --> 03:24:07,040
All right.

4589
03:24:07,040 --> 03:24:08,040
No, no, no.

4590
03:24:08,040 --> 03:24:09,040
That's fine.

4591
03:24:09,040 --> 03:24:10,040
That's fine.

4592
03:24:10,040 --> 03:24:11,040
Gotcha.

4593
03:24:11,040 --> 03:24:17,520
Be that as it may, I think it was on the 15th of September 2015, the congressional investigation

4594
03:24:17,520 --> 03:24:23,920
started into these videos and into Planned Parenthood, which now, because we're in the

4595
03:24:23,920 --> 03:24:27,720
future, we know they cleared them of any wrongdoing and found-

4596
03:24:27,720 --> 03:24:28,960
Any and all wrongdoing.

4597
03:24:28,960 --> 03:24:33,680
And found that those videos were deceitfully manipulated and edited poorly.

4598
03:24:33,680 --> 03:24:35,000
And they have been sued appropriately.

4599
03:24:35,000 --> 03:24:36,000
And Alex-

4600
03:24:36,000 --> 03:24:37,200
Or not appropriately.

4601
03:24:37,200 --> 03:24:38,200
They've been sued.

4602
03:24:38,200 --> 03:24:42,120
But actually, it's really fucked up.

4603
03:24:42,120 --> 03:24:47,560
Since we've started talking about this, the court case was still in motion.

4604
03:24:47,560 --> 03:24:48,560
Oh.

4605
03:24:48,560 --> 03:24:53,840
Just the last week, a bunch of those charges, we have said in the past that they have 15

4606
03:24:53,840 --> 03:24:55,960
felonies that are being put on them.

4607
03:24:55,960 --> 03:24:58,920
A bunch of those charges got dropped, like last week.

4608
03:24:58,920 --> 03:24:59,920
God damn it.

4609
03:24:59,920 --> 03:25:00,920
Yeah, I know.

4610
03:25:00,920 --> 03:25:01,920
Why do we live?

4611
03:25:01,920 --> 03:25:02,920
I don't know.

4612
03:25:02,920 --> 03:25:03,920
That's a-

4613
03:25:03,920 --> 03:25:04,920
But a lot of it-

4614
03:25:04,920 --> 03:25:07,240
There wasn't a, in this world, it was just, why do we live?

4615
03:25:07,240 --> 03:25:12,560
A lot of it comes down to technicalities, and it just becomes like a, is it worth prosecuting

4616
03:25:12,560 --> 03:25:13,560
this further?

4617
03:25:13,560 --> 03:25:21,520
Yeah, you get somebody on tax evasion, you know, you don't get them on murdering everybody

4618
03:25:21,520 --> 03:25:22,520
you've ever known.

4619
03:25:22,520 --> 03:25:27,840
All that aside, every investigation into whether these videos are full of shit have shown they're

4620
03:25:27,840 --> 03:25:28,880
full of shit.

4621
03:25:28,880 --> 03:25:33,560
So anyway, that's what Ted Cruz was talking about in a presidential debate.

4622
03:25:33,560 --> 03:25:34,560
Why are we here?

4623
03:25:34,560 --> 03:25:35,560
And Alex loves it.

4624
03:25:35,560 --> 03:25:36,560
Of course.

4625
03:25:36,560 --> 03:25:37,560
He's into fucking Cruz.

4626
03:25:37,560 --> 03:25:38,560
He's into Cruz.

4627
03:25:38,560 --> 03:25:39,560
Yeah.

4628
03:25:39,560 --> 03:25:40,560
So here we go.

4629
03:25:40,560 --> 03:25:42,680
Bush says, 40 years ago, he smoked marijuana.

4630
03:25:42,680 --> 03:25:43,680
I admit it.

4631
03:25:43,680 --> 03:25:44,680
Ooh, big deal.

4632
03:25:44,680 --> 03:25:47,200
You mean 40 years ago, your family shipped cocaine in.

4633
03:25:47,200 --> 03:25:49,320
That'd be a bigger admission.

4634
03:25:49,320 --> 03:25:55,400
Donald Trump says Rand Paul shouldn't be on the stage, and he's ugly.

4635
03:25:55,400 --> 03:25:59,320
Trump, you look pretty goofy to me.

4636
03:25:59,320 --> 03:26:00,320
Agreed.

4637
03:26:00,320 --> 03:26:01,320
I mean, I'll say it.

4638
03:26:01,320 --> 03:26:05,780
Rand Paul's got curly hair, which I don't think looks goofy, but I guess you could say

4639
03:26:05,780 --> 03:26:08,000
it looks goofy from your perspective.

4640
03:26:08,000 --> 03:26:14,520
You look like you have a dead blonde possum on your head, and it used to be brown.

4641
03:26:14,520 --> 03:26:19,280
Then it was chimpanzee colored, and now it's blonde.

4642
03:26:19,280 --> 03:26:23,360
So you get your hair bleached, Trump, to then turn it blonde.

4643
03:26:23,360 --> 03:26:26,000
So if anybody looks like a freak, it's you.

4644
03:26:26,000 --> 03:26:31,720
And I'm not up here attacking him, but he can't sit there and make comments about how

4645
03:26:31,720 --> 03:26:35,920
people look, and then not expect to have it thrown back at him.

4646
03:26:35,920 --> 03:26:36,920
Agreed.

4647
03:26:36,920 --> 03:26:37,920
I mean, it's just unbelievable.

4648
03:26:37,920 --> 03:26:38,920
Good point.

4649
03:26:38,920 --> 03:26:39,920
Good point.

4650
03:26:39,920 --> 03:26:40,920
It's unbelievable.

4651
03:26:40,920 --> 03:26:48,760
Then he goes on to say good things, where he talks about the fact that this is a country

4652
03:26:48,760 --> 03:26:51,680
where we speak English, not Spanish.

4653
03:26:51,680 --> 03:26:52,680
No.

4654
03:26:52,680 --> 03:26:53,680
No.

4655
03:26:53,680 --> 03:26:57,600
Alex, you had me.

4656
03:26:57,600 --> 03:26:58,600
Not great.

4657
03:26:58,600 --> 03:27:01,880
That's a pretty solid burn on Trump, though.

4658
03:27:01,880 --> 03:27:04,000
That's not too bad.

4659
03:27:04,000 --> 03:27:05,560
It's super unexpected.

4660
03:27:05,560 --> 03:27:06,560
Yeah.

4661
03:27:06,560 --> 03:27:07,560
Oh, man.

4662
03:27:07,560 --> 03:27:15,240
Considering we know that three months after this point, Trump is on Alex's show.

4663
03:27:15,240 --> 03:27:17,160
That's so fucked up.

4664
03:27:17,160 --> 03:27:18,520
What is going on?

4665
03:27:18,520 --> 03:27:19,520
I don't know.

4666
03:27:19,520 --> 03:27:23,440
He hasn't said any of these negative things.

4667
03:27:23,440 --> 03:27:28,320
How do you not think there's some sort of backroom negotiation going on, right?

4668
03:27:28,320 --> 03:27:29,320
Figure me out.

4669
03:27:29,320 --> 03:27:30,320
Here's what I think.

4670
03:27:30,320 --> 03:27:31,320
Oh, fuck, yes.

4671
03:27:31,320 --> 03:27:32,320
Give it to me.

4672
03:27:32,320 --> 03:27:33,920
Give it to me, Dan.

4673
03:27:33,920 --> 03:27:38,040
I think the payment hasn't cleared.

4674
03:27:38,040 --> 03:27:40,240
You think the check hasn't cleared?

4675
03:27:40,240 --> 03:27:44,960
Like he's endorsed it, but he's still like, I don't know if it's going to bounce.

4676
03:27:44,960 --> 03:27:50,520
Why do you think he's surprised to wake up and there's 500,000 in the...

4677
03:27:50,520 --> 03:27:51,880
Okay.

4678
03:27:51,880 --> 03:27:53,280
Why do you think he's disappointed?

4679
03:27:53,280 --> 03:27:58,600
So he's mad because he hasn't reached the million dollar goal yet, and he thinks that

4680
03:27:58,600 --> 03:28:05,240
the million dollar goal would have been met if the check had cleared?

4681
03:28:05,240 --> 03:28:06,240
That seems crazy.

4682
03:28:06,240 --> 03:28:10,240
I can't tell how fucking much of what I'm trying to pitch is.

4683
03:28:10,240 --> 03:28:12,160
I'm just trying to make sense of this shit.

4684
03:28:12,160 --> 03:28:13,160
I love you.

4685
03:28:13,160 --> 03:28:14,160
It's so crazy.

4686
03:28:14,160 --> 03:28:16,800
And I want you to be right, but that's too far.

4687
03:28:16,800 --> 03:28:18,800
But it's nonsense.

4688
03:28:18,800 --> 03:28:22,560
Take all of that, because I don't think that's necessarily true.

4689
03:28:22,560 --> 03:28:25,360
Take all... I mean, the shit about Trump's hair is absolutely

4690
03:28:25,360 --> 03:28:26,360
true.

4691
03:28:26,360 --> 03:28:27,360
100%.

4692
03:28:27,360 --> 03:28:28,360
Looks exactly like what he described.

4693
03:28:28,360 --> 03:28:30,200
Take my nonsense out of it.

4694
03:28:30,200 --> 03:28:38,280
The thought that he can be, fuck you, shut your mouth, you're a punk, eh, you're fine,

4695
03:28:38,280 --> 03:28:39,920
you stop talking about immigrants, whatever.

4696
03:28:39,920 --> 03:28:41,640
Oh, you're mad at Rand Paul.

4697
03:28:41,640 --> 03:28:46,760
I'm going to fucking attack you about your appearance to being, I fucking look, can I

4698
03:28:46,760 --> 03:28:48,160
suck your dick, please?

4699
03:28:48,160 --> 03:28:49,160
Yeah.

4700
03:28:49,160 --> 03:28:51,800
Within three months is crazy.

4701
03:28:51,800 --> 03:28:52,800
Yeah.

4702
03:28:52,800 --> 03:28:59,920
There's no ground, and the idea that once he becomes Trump's cheerleader, he doesn't

4703
03:28:59,920 --> 03:29:02,840
think that all this still exists on the internet?

4704
03:29:02,840 --> 03:29:06,480
Well, as we've established, he has no concept of the past.

4705
03:29:06,480 --> 03:29:12,240
Well, the idea that all that stuff- Every time we've gone through, Alex Jones

4706
03:29:12,240 --> 03:29:17,360
says this now in defense of, we go back and we have a clip of him saying, and this is

4707
03:29:17,360 --> 03:29:20,000
the same thing with fucking Trump.

4708
03:29:20,000 --> 03:29:25,160
Nothing Trump has ever said, we have a tweet saying him, of him saying the opposite.

4709
03:29:25,160 --> 03:29:27,160
Or our new friend, Scaramucci.

4710
03:29:27,160 --> 03:29:29,280
They just don't even fucking care.

4711
03:29:29,280 --> 03:29:30,280
They don't care.

4712
03:29:30,280 --> 03:29:33,340
They don't care.

4713
03:29:33,340 --> 03:29:36,900
Nobody is actually holding them accountable, which is the big issue.

4714
03:29:36,900 --> 03:29:41,160
We can go on Twitter and we can see people going like, here's what they said, here's

4715
03:29:41,160 --> 03:29:44,760
what they used to say, but nobody's actually fucking doing anything.

4716
03:29:44,760 --> 03:29:45,760
We're trying.

4717
03:29:45,760 --> 03:29:47,360
And I don't know what to do.

4718
03:29:47,360 --> 03:29:48,360
We're trying.

4719
03:29:48,360 --> 03:29:51,200
I wake up every day and I don't know what to do.

4720
03:29:51,200 --> 03:29:53,440
Dan, tell me what to do.

4721
03:29:53,440 --> 03:29:55,160
I can't tell you, but we're trying.

4722
03:29:55,160 --> 03:29:56,520
We got a couple more clips to get through.

4723
03:29:56,520 --> 03:29:57,520
Let's do this.

4724
03:29:57,520 --> 03:29:58,520
Okay.

4725
03:29:58,520 --> 03:29:59,520
We're on hour 17.

4726
03:29:59,520 --> 03:30:05,000
Yeah, we're trying to do a fundraiser.

4727
03:30:05,000 --> 03:30:06,840
We're just bad at it.

4728
03:30:06,840 --> 03:30:18,160
So I made a point of the fact that Alex has been very pro-Russia, as we've seen.

4729
03:30:18,160 --> 03:30:24,240
Or at the very least pro-strong man, pro-Putin, not necessarily pro-Russia.

4730
03:30:24,240 --> 03:30:27,640
No, no, that's not fair.

4731
03:30:27,640 --> 03:30:28,760
Pro-Russia and pro-Assad.

4732
03:30:28,760 --> 03:30:29,760
He has been.

4733
03:30:29,760 --> 03:30:30,760
He has been pro-Russia.

4734
03:30:30,760 --> 03:30:33,560
Before this episode, he's been pro-strong man.

4735
03:30:33,560 --> 03:30:37,920
The things he said in this episode have been legitimately pro-Russia, pro-Assad.

4736
03:30:37,920 --> 03:30:38,920
You're right.

4737
03:30:38,920 --> 03:30:39,920
I agree.

4738
03:30:39,920 --> 03:30:42,680
This next clip brings it home.

4739
03:30:42,680 --> 03:30:47,280
They don't like saying we're fighting ISIS when they've got to resupply C-130's landing,

4740
03:30:47,280 --> 03:30:53,000
delivering them weapons on the hour, in battle with Russian commandos who are on the right

4741
03:30:53,000 --> 03:30:54,000
side.

4742
03:30:54,000 --> 03:30:58,920
Do you think America, the actual military, likes being clearly on the bad side with Al

4743
03:30:58,920 --> 03:31:03,280
Qaeda, launching wars, and then back home, we've got to take your rights away because

4744
03:31:03,280 --> 03:31:04,280
of Al Qaeda?

4745
03:31:04,280 --> 03:31:09,400
Do you think anybody in the government likes being part of that?

4746
03:31:09,400 --> 03:31:14,640
So Alex Jones in that clip essentially is saying that we are on the wrong side of everything.

4747
03:31:14,640 --> 03:31:19,220
Russia is on the right side of everything.

4748
03:31:19,220 --> 03:31:22,000
But how?

4749
03:31:22,000 --> 03:31:24,140
What is his justification for it?

4750
03:31:24,140 --> 03:31:33,260
We have funded and created Al Qaeda and ISIS in order to destabilize Syria, and because

4751
03:31:33,260 --> 03:31:37,280
of that, we are on the wrong side of everything.

4752
03:31:37,280 --> 03:31:41,120
Russia and Assad are really just trying to destroy the forces that we have brought in

4753
03:31:41,120 --> 03:31:46,880
there for destabilization, and, you know, that makes sense.

4754
03:31:46,880 --> 03:31:52,160
I just don't get that very simplistic argument because there's a—

4755
03:31:52,160 --> 03:31:53,160
Well, because it's dumb.

4756
03:31:53,160 --> 03:32:03,120
In the same way that there's a kernel of truth to it that is also such a willful misunderstanding

4757
03:32:03,120 --> 03:32:06,880
of the way that the world works, it's hard to imagine.

4758
03:32:06,880 --> 03:32:07,880
Totally.

4759
03:32:07,880 --> 03:32:11,560
So Alex Jones is in favor of Russia and Assad.

4760
03:32:11,560 --> 03:32:12,560
Great.

4761
03:32:12,560 --> 03:32:13,560
Cool.

4762
03:32:13,560 --> 03:32:17,320
But what's the motivation for him being in favor of Assad at this point?

4763
03:32:17,320 --> 03:32:18,600
We already talked about it.

4764
03:32:18,600 --> 03:32:19,600
We already talked about it.

4765
03:32:19,600 --> 03:32:23,320
He's in favor of all of these Russian propaganda outlets.

4766
03:32:23,320 --> 03:32:30,960
He's beholden to RT and Sputnik as information sources.

4767
03:32:30,960 --> 03:32:37,160
I mean, yeah, you make the good point of him as information sources, but if you do—

4768
03:32:37,160 --> 03:32:38,760
They put out stories about—

4769
03:32:38,760 --> 03:32:39,760
If you do even—

4770
03:32:39,760 --> 03:32:46,600
No, because the things that you will say about Assad being oppressive to his people—

4771
03:32:46,600 --> 03:32:47,600
Murdering!

4772
03:32:47,600 --> 03:32:48,600
Not being oppressive!

4773
03:32:48,600 --> 03:32:49,600
Murdering!

4774
03:32:49,600 --> 03:32:50,600
Right?

4775
03:32:50,600 --> 03:32:51,600
All that stuff.

4776
03:32:51,600 --> 03:32:52,600
Gassing.

4777
03:32:52,600 --> 03:32:53,600
Yeah.

4778
03:32:53,600 --> 03:32:54,600
I like how you yadda yadda.

4779
03:32:54,600 --> 03:32:55,600
All that stuff.

4780
03:32:55,600 --> 03:32:56,600
No, no, no.

4781
03:32:56,600 --> 03:32:58,160
That's what I was going to get to as my sense went along.

4782
03:32:58,160 --> 03:32:59,160
No, no, no, no.

4783
03:32:59,160 --> 03:33:00,160
I know.

4784
03:33:00,160 --> 03:33:01,160
I just had to—

4785
03:33:01,160 --> 03:33:06,760
The Russian version of it that comes out in Sputnik and RT is that it is Western-backed

4786
03:33:06,760 --> 03:33:10,120
rebel forces that are faking these attacks.

4787
03:33:10,120 --> 03:33:11,120
I didn't know that.

4788
03:33:11,120 --> 03:33:12,120
Yeah.

4789
03:33:12,120 --> 03:33:13,120
That is the narrative.

4790
03:33:13,120 --> 03:33:14,120
That's their narrative?

4791
03:33:14,120 --> 03:33:15,120
Yes.

4792
03:33:15,120 --> 03:33:16,120
For real?

4793
03:33:16,120 --> 03:33:17,120
Yes!

4794
03:33:17,120 --> 03:33:18,120
And that's the narrative that Alex buys.

4795
03:33:18,120 --> 03:33:19,120
So because—

4796
03:33:19,120 --> 03:33:21,400
And that's why we've talked about this on the show a bunch of times.

4797
03:33:21,400 --> 03:33:22,400
Yeah.

4798
03:33:22,400 --> 03:33:26,760
Alex has these people on who are disreputable sources, like Larry C. Johnson.

4799
03:33:26,760 --> 03:33:27,760
Yeah.

4800
03:33:27,760 --> 03:33:33,360
And I can't remember that ambassador guy who he had on who had clear financial interests.

4801
03:33:33,360 --> 03:33:34,360
Yeah, of course.

4802
03:33:34,360 --> 03:33:42,320
Well, fucking every—if you're Russian and you are on media of any sort, you probably

4803
03:33:42,320 --> 03:33:44,960
have ties to the oligarchy.

4804
03:33:44,960 --> 03:33:48,080
With a couple exceptions, yes, absolutely.

4805
03:33:48,080 --> 03:33:53,080
So that is the narrative that Alex is on board with.

4806
03:33:53,080 --> 03:33:58,960
It seems dumb, it seems wild, but that's what he pushes.

4807
03:33:58,960 --> 03:34:00,660
Every single thing—

4808
03:34:00,660 --> 03:34:08,960
It's the Assad thing, though, that—like, I get arguing other Russian things, but Assad

4809
03:34:08,960 --> 03:34:14,200
has so very clearly set out to murder his own people.

4810
03:34:14,200 --> 03:34:15,200
Well, here's where—

4811
03:34:15,200 --> 03:34:20,160
It seems like such a simp—it seems like a Hitler thing all over again.

4812
03:34:20,160 --> 03:34:23,920
Like, are you for Hitler murdering Jews or against?

4813
03:34:23,920 --> 03:34:25,640
That's what Assad is to me.

4814
03:34:25,640 --> 03:34:33,480
Well, here's where Alex gets his leeway, is that Obama said the red line is using gas

4815
03:34:33,480 --> 03:34:34,680
attacks on your people.

4816
03:34:34,680 --> 03:34:41,880
And then he didn't do shit, which he thinks—which Obama has clearly stated is one of his more

4817
03:34:41,880 --> 03:34:45,960
proud moments of not sending the world into World War III.

4818
03:34:45,960 --> 03:34:46,960
Agreed.

4819
03:34:46,960 --> 03:34:54,480
But Alex's, and all of Russian media's argument about that is, why the fuck would Assad do

4820
03:34:54,480 --> 03:34:58,080
that if Obama said that that was a red line?

4821
03:34:58,080 --> 03:34:59,080
Why would they do that?

4822
03:34:59,080 --> 03:35:00,080
Okay.

4823
03:35:00,080 --> 03:35:01,080
Okay.

4824
03:35:01,080 --> 03:35:02,080
That's a—

4825
03:35:02,080 --> 03:35:03,080
Which is compelling—

4826
03:35:03,080 --> 03:35:04,080
That's an interesting angle, yeah.

4827
03:35:04,080 --> 03:35:05,080
I agree.

4828
03:35:05,080 --> 03:35:12,440
It's compelling to a ton of people if you don't think Obama might have been bluffing.

4829
03:35:12,440 --> 03:35:13,440
Okay.

4830
03:35:13,440 --> 03:35:14,440
So—

4831
03:35:14,440 --> 03:35:17,640
Because the end result legitimately is World War III.

4832
03:35:17,640 --> 03:35:18,640
So what their—

4833
03:35:18,640 --> 03:35:24,480
Like, if we went in—if Obama saw gassing of the people—

4834
03:35:24,480 --> 03:35:25,480
Yeah.

4835
03:35:25,480 --> 03:35:26,480
So he makes his red line.

4836
03:35:26,480 --> 03:35:27,480
Right.

4837
03:35:27,480 --> 03:35:31,600
And if Obama knows that it happens, and he doesn't get in there and fucking burn the

4838
03:35:31,600 --> 03:35:37,960
shit to the ground, then it must be that he also knows it's a false flag.

4839
03:35:37,960 --> 03:35:38,960
Right.

4840
03:35:38,960 --> 03:35:45,000
And also, before that, Putin had made very clear that he was not going to accept any

4841
03:35:45,000 --> 03:35:46,600
of our aggression in Syria.

4842
03:35:46,600 --> 03:35:47,600
Yeah, exactly.

4843
03:35:47,600 --> 03:35:52,480
Like, it is a much more complicated chess game than Alex is presenting.

4844
03:35:52,480 --> 03:35:53,480
Right, right, right.

4845
03:35:53,480 --> 03:35:57,960
All of it is just to serve this Russian propaganda message.

4846
03:35:57,960 --> 03:36:00,200
I'm not saying that he's an agent of Russia.

4847
03:36:00,200 --> 03:36:01,200
That's not at all my—

4848
03:36:01,200 --> 03:36:02,200
No, but that's—

4849
03:36:02,200 --> 03:36:03,200
He's just dumb.

4850
03:36:03,200 --> 03:36:04,200
He falls—

4851
03:36:04,200 --> 03:36:05,200
That's not the—yeah, yeah.

4852
03:36:05,200 --> 03:36:06,200
That's not the narrative.

4853
03:36:06,200 --> 03:36:07,200
No.

4854
03:36:07,200 --> 03:36:09,120
Why would you even need him to be an agent of Russia—

4855
03:36:09,120 --> 03:36:10,120
No.

4856
03:36:10,120 --> 03:36:11,120
That's stupid.

4857
03:36:11,120 --> 03:36:17,280
—if you have this kind of weird—it's such a—man, foreign policy is tough.

4858
03:36:17,280 --> 03:36:18,280
I don't know—

4859
03:36:18,280 --> 03:36:19,280
It's very complicated.

4860
03:36:19,280 --> 03:36:25,140
Dan, I don't know if you know this or not, but global foreign policy?

4861
03:36:25,140 --> 03:36:26,140
Very complicated.

4862
03:36:26,140 --> 03:36:27,140
I'm a wonk.

4863
03:36:27,140 --> 03:36:28,140
Anyway—

4864
03:36:28,140 --> 03:36:29,140
Very complicated.

4865
03:36:29,140 --> 03:36:34,080
So, all that aside, I want to be entirely clear.

4866
03:36:34,080 --> 03:36:39,920
We did—we've made a lot of mistakes in terms of arming rebels and stuff like that throughout

4867
03:36:39,920 --> 03:36:42,280
the entirety of our history as a country.

4868
03:36:42,280 --> 03:36:43,280
America?

4869
03:36:43,280 --> 03:36:44,280
Yeah.

4870
03:36:44,280 --> 03:36:45,280
Disagree.

4871
03:36:45,280 --> 03:36:46,280
Right.

4872
03:36:46,280 --> 03:36:47,280
No nationalism.

4873
03:36:47,280 --> 03:36:53,480
That said, Putin, Assad are not good guys.

4874
03:36:53,480 --> 03:36:55,080
And what they're doing in Syria?

4875
03:36:55,080 --> 03:36:56,080
Not good.

4876
03:36:56,080 --> 03:36:57,080
Assad should be lit on fire.

4877
03:36:57,080 --> 03:36:58,080
Yeah.

4878
03:36:58,080 --> 03:36:59,080
Now.

4879
03:36:59,080 --> 03:37:00,080
So—

4880
03:37:00,080 --> 03:37:01,080
Right now.

4881
03:37:01,080 --> 03:37:05,500
If you are a knowledge fighter and you are within, let's say, three feet of Assad and

4882
03:37:05,500 --> 03:37:08,800
you can light him on fire, please light him on fire.

4883
03:37:08,800 --> 03:37:10,640
Just make him hot for a little bit.

4884
03:37:10,640 --> 03:37:12,120
Just burn him to death.

4885
03:37:12,120 --> 03:37:14,900
No, if you've got like a—

4886
03:37:14,900 --> 03:37:17,960
If he survives, you're lighting him on fire.

4887
03:37:17,960 --> 03:37:20,640
Lighting him on fire ten more times.

4888
03:37:20,640 --> 03:37:22,120
And then meme it.

4889
03:37:22,120 --> 03:37:23,120
So—

4890
03:37:23,120 --> 03:37:29,480
Yeah, like the anti-CNN that memes you?

4891
03:37:29,480 --> 03:37:31,720
Actually, Alex just paid out $20,000.

4892
03:37:31,720 --> 03:37:32,720
All right.

4893
03:37:32,720 --> 03:37:33,720
Kill us all.

4894
03:37:33,720 --> 03:37:34,720
Just paid out $20,000.

4895
03:37:34,720 --> 03:37:35,720
Just fucking.

4896
03:37:35,720 --> 03:37:36,720
Just fucking.

4897
03:37:36,720 --> 03:37:37,720
I'm done.

4898
03:37:37,720 --> 03:37:38,720
What a shock.

4899
03:37:38,720 --> 03:37:39,720
I'm done.

4900
03:37:39,720 --> 03:37:40,720
What a shock.

4901
03:37:40,720 --> 03:37:41,720
You know who won?

4902
03:37:41,720 --> 03:37:42,720
Who won?

4903
03:37:42,720 --> 03:37:43,720
Some guy that Alex Jones offered a job to.

4904
03:37:43,720 --> 03:37:44,720
Jesus.

4905
03:37:44,720 --> 03:37:45,720
It was that guy?

4906
03:37:45,720 --> 03:37:46,720
Well, there are two guys.

4907
03:37:46,720 --> 03:37:47,720
Fuck off.

4908
03:37:47,720 --> 03:37:48,720
Two guys.

4909
03:37:48,720 --> 03:37:49,720
Yeah.

4910
03:37:49,720 --> 03:37:53,920
Alex Jones offered a job to the first and second place guys, but here was the fucking

4911
03:37:53,920 --> 03:37:54,920
awesome.

4912
03:37:54,920 --> 03:37:55,920
Like, I wish—

4913
03:37:55,920 --> 03:37:56,920
Fuck.

4914
03:37:56,920 --> 03:37:57,920
I'm so—

4915
03:37:57,920 --> 03:37:59,920
I'm an idiot because I don't have the clip of this.

4916
03:37:59,920 --> 03:38:02,200
But it's so fucking hilarious.

4917
03:38:02,200 --> 03:38:06,840
He's sitting there and he's like, all right, I told Paul Joseph Watson he got to pick the

4918
03:38:06,840 --> 03:38:10,480
winner and I don't think this is the winner.

4919
03:38:10,480 --> 03:38:13,520
I think the winner is the Braveheart one.

4920
03:38:13,520 --> 03:38:15,000
That guy's great.

4921
03:38:15,000 --> 03:38:16,120
You got a job.

4922
03:38:16,120 --> 03:38:17,120
Just hit me up.

4923
03:38:17,120 --> 03:38:18,120
You got a job.

4924
03:38:18,120 --> 03:38:19,120
Please.

4925
03:38:19,120 --> 03:38:20,120
I want to work with you.

4926
03:38:20,120 --> 03:38:21,120
You got a job.

4927
03:38:21,120 --> 03:38:22,120
A guy did a Braveheart version of—

4928
03:38:22,120 --> 03:38:23,120
You got a job.

4929
03:38:23,120 --> 03:38:26,200
It's just Braveheart, but with Trump as William Wallace.

4930
03:38:26,200 --> 03:38:27,720
And he's like, you got a job.

4931
03:38:27,720 --> 03:38:33,280
No, look, I told Paul Joseph Watson he could choose the winner and he got the $20,000.

4932
03:38:33,280 --> 03:38:34,280
It's honor bound.

4933
03:38:34,280 --> 03:38:35,280
What did Rappaport have to do to get a job?

4934
03:38:35,280 --> 03:38:39,720
He just cucked out the winner of the fucking contest that he started.

4935
03:38:39,720 --> 03:38:40,720
Of course.

4936
03:38:40,720 --> 03:38:44,440
The winner was—okay, of course it's a movie.

4937
03:38:44,440 --> 03:38:46,440
I'm going to give you three guesses.

4938
03:38:46,440 --> 03:38:48,680
I'm going to give you three guesses.

4939
03:38:48,680 --> 03:38:50,680
And now consider the mythology—

4940
03:38:50,680 --> 03:38:51,680
Gladiator.

4941
03:38:51,680 --> 03:38:52,680
Gladiator.

4942
03:38:52,680 --> 03:38:53,680
Gladiator.

4943
03:38:53,680 --> 03:38:54,680
That's your first?

4944
03:38:54,680 --> 03:38:55,680
Gladiator.

4945
03:38:55,680 --> 03:38:56,680
No.

4946
03:38:56,680 --> 03:38:57,680
That's also my second.

4947
03:38:57,680 --> 03:38:58,680
Gladiator again.

4948
03:38:58,680 --> 03:38:59,680
Consider the mythology of Infowars.

4949
03:38:59,680 --> 03:39:00,680
Okay.

4950
03:39:00,680 --> 03:39:01,680
How he talks about false realities.

4951
03:39:01,680 --> 03:39:02,680
Oh, the Patriot.

4952
03:39:02,680 --> 03:39:03,680
No.

4953
03:39:03,680 --> 03:39:04,680
Um.

4954
03:39:04,680 --> 03:39:05,680
You got one more.

4955
03:39:05,680 --> 03:39:08,040
This should be obvious.

4956
03:39:08,040 --> 03:39:09,880
All other Mel Gibson movies.

4957
03:39:09,880 --> 03:39:10,880
No.

4958
03:39:10,880 --> 03:39:11,880
But it should be obvious.

4959
03:39:11,880 --> 03:39:12,880
Come on.

4960
03:39:12,880 --> 03:39:14,840
You got this.

4961
03:39:14,840 --> 03:39:15,840
Infowars.

4962
03:39:15,840 --> 03:39:16,840
Um.

4963
03:39:16,840 --> 03:39:19,840
A scanner darkly?

4964
03:39:19,840 --> 03:39:20,840
Like I don't know.

4965
03:39:20,840 --> 03:39:21,840
That's closer.

4966
03:39:21,840 --> 03:39:22,840
I got nothing.

4967
03:39:22,840 --> 03:39:23,840
Matrix.

4968
03:39:23,840 --> 03:39:24,840
Oh, come on.

4969
03:39:24,840 --> 03:39:25,840
No.

4970
03:39:25,840 --> 03:39:28,120
That—you can't even—that was made by trans women.

4971
03:39:28,120 --> 03:39:30,000
Yeah, I know.

4972
03:39:30,000 --> 03:39:31,640
You don't get to steal that.

4973
03:39:31,640 --> 03:39:32,640
Oh, they did.

4974
03:39:32,640 --> 03:39:34,360
You don't get to.

4975
03:39:34,360 --> 03:39:41,720
It's that scene where Agent Smiths are shooting at Neo down a hallway and he stops the bullets.

4976
03:39:41,720 --> 03:39:42,720
Yeah.

4977
03:39:42,720 --> 03:39:44,280
And all the bullets are fake news.

4978
03:39:44,280 --> 03:39:46,480
Dives into—oh, fuck off.

4979
03:39:46,480 --> 03:39:47,480
Yeah, it's nonsense.

4980
03:39:47,480 --> 03:39:48,480
Jesus Christ.

4981
03:39:48,480 --> 03:39:53,320
But he paid $20,000 and has offered both of them jobs.

4982
03:39:53,320 --> 03:39:55,120
Have we considered doing one of those?

4983
03:39:55,120 --> 03:39:56,120
No.

4984
03:39:56,120 --> 03:39:57,120
I bet we could come up with a better idea.

4985
03:39:57,120 --> 03:39:58,120
We can't play meme warfare.

4986
03:39:58,120 --> 03:39:59,120
That's true.

4987
03:39:59,120 --> 03:40:00,120
It's nonsense.

4988
03:40:00,120 --> 03:40:01,120
That's true.

4989
03:40:01,120 --> 03:40:02,600
That is a fickle, fly-by-night piece of bullshit.

4990
03:40:02,600 --> 03:40:03,600
Yeah.

4991
03:40:03,600 --> 03:40:06,000
We've got to get these last two clips out.

4992
03:40:06,000 --> 03:40:07,000
We've got two—

4993
03:40:07,000 --> 03:40:08,000
Yeah.

4994
03:40:08,000 --> 03:40:12,040
We're on hour seven and a half.

4995
03:40:12,040 --> 03:40:13,040
Jordan.

4996
03:40:13,040 --> 03:40:14,040
Yes.

4997
03:40:14,040 --> 03:40:15,040
The debate.

4998
03:40:15,040 --> 03:40:16,040
Yes.

4999
03:40:16,040 --> 03:40:21,800
Alex mentioned this a little bit earlier, that Trump said some good things in the debate.

5000
03:40:21,800 --> 03:40:22,800
Right.

5001
03:40:22,800 --> 03:40:26,200
Now, one of them was that people speak English here, not Spanish, which sucks.

5002
03:40:26,200 --> 03:40:27,200
I didn't like that.

5003
03:40:27,200 --> 03:40:28,200
I didn't like that.

5004
03:40:28,200 --> 03:40:29,200
It sucks.

5005
03:40:29,200 --> 03:40:36,240
But Trump said some other things that Alex did like, and they're not good.

5006
03:40:36,240 --> 03:40:42,680
But I've got to say, as a litmus test, Donald Trump coming out against vaccines and saying,

5007
03:40:42,680 --> 03:40:47,880
I've got a lot of friends and family who've got brain-damaged kids from this, shows that

5008
03:40:47,880 --> 03:40:52,800
he really cares about people, and he knows the system's going to come after him, and

5009
03:40:52,800 --> 03:40:54,200
he understands what's going on.

5010
03:40:54,200 --> 03:40:57,840
And when the rubber meets the road, he doesn't want to be involved in brain damaging tens

5011
03:40:57,840 --> 03:41:00,280
of millions of children.

5012
03:41:00,280 --> 03:41:01,880
Which is why he's removing health care.

5013
03:41:01,880 --> 03:41:06,680
The vaccines are linked to increased cancer, neurological disorders, autoimmune disorders.

5014
03:41:06,680 --> 03:41:09,320
It says it on the stinking inserts.

5015
03:41:09,320 --> 03:41:17,840
And Ben Carson, a medical doctor, a brain surgeon, not an epidemiologist, not a virologist,

5016
03:41:17,840 --> 03:41:22,600
he just sits there and says it's wonderful because he's a good guy as a doctor, so he

5017
03:41:22,600 --> 03:41:24,560
believes everything they're doing must be wonderful.

5018
03:41:24,560 --> 03:41:30,040
I like you making fun of his doctorate when you're also not a doctor.

5019
03:41:30,040 --> 03:41:41,760
But that, in the debate, Trump talked about how when he had kids, he spaced out the vaccines.

5020
03:41:41,760 --> 03:41:43,240
Because he thought that like...

5021
03:41:43,240 --> 03:41:45,280
That's the argument that I've heard a bunch recently.

5022
03:41:45,280 --> 03:41:49,200
If they get that full vaccine, it's a horse tranquilizer.

5023
03:41:49,200 --> 03:41:54,120
It's a huge horse needle, which isn't true at all.

5024
03:41:54,120 --> 03:42:00,040
And then I don't want to put too fine a point on this, and we're already four hours into

5025
03:42:00,040 --> 03:42:06,560
this podcast, but I have looked into all of it and all of the anti-vax stuff.

5026
03:42:06,560 --> 03:42:07,560
It's bullshit.

5027
03:42:07,560 --> 03:42:08,560
It's all bullshit.

5028
03:42:08,560 --> 03:42:09,800
It's absolutely nonsense.

5029
03:42:09,800 --> 03:42:15,080
It's been bullshit since the 1890s.

5030
03:42:15,080 --> 03:42:21,600
Since vaccines were created, one guy got a fucking thing happened to him within two weeks

5031
03:42:21,600 --> 03:42:24,720
of a vaccine, and he was like, well, it's vaccines.

5032
03:42:24,720 --> 03:42:26,240
It is always bullshit.

5033
03:42:26,240 --> 03:42:28,720
It is always fucking bullshit.

5034
03:42:28,720 --> 03:42:36,600
I can't begin to deal with how much I hate you if you're an anti-vaxxer.

5035
03:42:36,600 --> 03:42:43,060
All of it is sussed out legitimately by one sentence that is one of the most important

5036
03:42:43,060 --> 03:42:51,480
sentences in terms of statistics, and that is that correlation does not imply causation.

5037
03:42:51,480 --> 03:42:57,200
If there is something that there is a slight relation to, you can't say just because there's

5038
03:42:57,200 --> 03:43:00,760
a relation that X caused Y.

5039
03:43:00,760 --> 03:43:01,760
You can't.

5040
03:43:01,760 --> 03:43:02,760
That's science.

5041
03:43:02,760 --> 03:43:06,840
Correlation does not equal causation is the bane of our existence.

5042
03:43:06,840 --> 03:43:12,320
The fact that it is true and the fact that it is almost impossible for most people to

5043
03:43:12,320 --> 03:43:18,680
recognize is the most destructive force, I don't know, in my lifetime.

5044
03:43:18,680 --> 03:43:25,880
One of the biggest cases about this, and Alex Jones talks about, like in the UK, the guy

5045
03:43:25,880 --> 03:43:30,040
who did studies about vaccines- It was the Dred Scott case, right?

5046
03:43:30,040 --> 03:43:31,040
No.

5047
03:43:31,040 --> 03:43:37,000
It was this guy named Andrew Wakefield, and he did some studies that were called into

5048
03:43:37,000 --> 03:43:45,800
question and he got fired because it turned out he was taking a ton of money from lawyers

5049
03:43:45,800 --> 03:43:50,480
that were discredited and his license was revoked.

5050
03:43:50,480 --> 03:43:56,920
There were lawyers who were trying to get a class action lawsuit going on behalf of

5051
03:43:56,920 --> 03:44:04,080
people who hated vaccines, and he got like $400,000 from those lawyers.

5052
03:44:04,080 --> 03:44:10,520
And so all of his studies, people who signed onto his studies in the past not knowing that

5053
03:44:10,520 --> 03:44:16,000
monetary payment, who were involved, they were like, oh shit.

5054
03:44:16,000 --> 03:44:17,000
Wait.

5055
03:44:17,000 --> 03:44:18,000
Hold on a second.

5056
03:44:18,000 --> 03:44:23,880
Are you saying that when you get money involved with healthcare, bad things happen?

5057
03:44:23,880 --> 03:44:24,880
Especially with studies.

5058
03:44:24,880 --> 03:44:25,880
Nah.

5059
03:44:25,880 --> 03:44:26,880
Can't believe it.

5060
03:44:26,880 --> 03:44:29,440
Especially when conclusions are- Capitalism!

5061
03:44:29,440 --> 03:44:30,480
Free market!

5062
03:44:30,480 --> 03:44:32,480
Free market, baby.

5063
03:44:32,480 --> 03:44:33,480
Guns!

5064
03:44:33,480 --> 03:44:34,480
Prosperity.

5065
03:44:34,480 --> 03:44:35,480
Prosperity.

5066
03:44:35,480 --> 03:44:42,480
Anyway, Alex is pretty thrilled with that anti-vax message.

5067
03:44:42,480 --> 03:44:49,480
But I honestly think, if I can be totally clear, I think that no matter what happened

5068
03:44:49,480 --> 03:44:53,600
in that debate, Alex would find something to love.

5069
03:44:53,600 --> 03:44:54,600
About Trump?

5070
03:44:54,600 --> 03:44:55,600
Yeah.

5071
03:44:55,600 --> 03:44:56,600
You think so?

5072
03:44:56,600 --> 03:44:57,600
Yeah.

5073
03:44:57,600 --> 03:44:58,600
I think it's in his timeline.

5074
03:44:58,600 --> 03:45:00,520
So you think this is the money situation again?

5075
03:45:00,520 --> 03:45:01,520
I do.

5076
03:45:01,520 --> 03:45:05,760
So he fixated on one thing that Trump said.

5077
03:45:05,760 --> 03:45:08,600
Like now I kind of want to go back- Can I tell you why?

5078
03:45:08,600 --> 03:45:13,520
I would rather die, but I kind of want to go back and watch that debate to see how many

5079
03:45:13,520 --> 03:45:18,880
things Trump said that he would have disagreed with versus how many he did agree with.

5080
03:45:18,880 --> 03:45:19,880
I have no idea.

5081
03:45:19,880 --> 03:45:20,880
Right?

5082
03:45:20,880 --> 03:45:28,080
But I did go back and look into Trump's anti-vax history, and he got in some fucking hot water

5083
03:45:28,080 --> 03:45:32,360
like three months before this for anti-vax stuff.

5084
03:45:32,360 --> 03:45:36,920
And he has an anti-vax history that goes back to like 2005.

5085
03:45:36,920 --> 03:45:43,000
Oh, so it's a full-on birther kind of situation where it's been there from the beginning.

5086
03:45:43,000 --> 03:45:44,000
This isn't news.

5087
03:45:44,000 --> 03:45:46,760
This is just he said it at a debate.

5088
03:45:46,760 --> 03:45:47,760
Right.

5089
03:45:47,760 --> 03:45:51,800
And so Alex Jones' position is like, he's going to be attacked for this, but he had

5090
03:45:51,800 --> 03:45:53,900
been attacked for it already.

5091
03:45:53,900 --> 03:45:58,800
He's pretending that this is some sort of like new wrinkle in his character, which it's

5092
03:45:58,800 --> 03:45:59,800
not.

5093
03:45:59,800 --> 03:46:03,520
I honestly think- Well, I mean in the context of his campaign,

5094
03:46:03,520 --> 03:46:04,960
has this been a thing?

5095
03:46:04,960 --> 03:46:06,800
No, I don't think this has been.

5096
03:46:06,800 --> 03:46:08,920
He's been too busy complaining about immigrants, though.

5097
03:46:08,920 --> 03:46:15,080
Well, and in the same way that in his campaign, it hasn't been all about birtherism, you know?

5098
03:46:15,080 --> 03:46:18,920
It hasn't been all about- Hey, he didn't start that.

5099
03:46:18,920 --> 03:46:20,920
He stopped it.

5100
03:46:20,920 --> 03:46:28,560
Yeah, so I think that there's a little bit of manipulation going on.

5101
03:46:28,560 --> 03:46:29,560
Yeah.

5102
03:46:29,560 --> 03:46:30,560
A little bit.

5103
03:46:30,560 --> 03:46:33,920
And if Alex Jones, like- At the very least.

5104
03:46:33,920 --> 03:46:40,880
In terms of our show, this is maybe four episodes back, but Alex Jones, when he made his pivot

5105
03:46:40,880 --> 03:46:47,580
to stop talking shit about Trump in terms of his mob ties, he said, I went back and

5106
03:46:47,580 --> 03:46:49,480
I did deep research on him.

5107
03:46:49,480 --> 03:46:50,480
Bullshit.

5108
03:46:50,480 --> 03:46:56,320
He watched all his speeches, and if he had done that, he would already know that he has

5109
03:46:56,320 --> 03:46:59,560
a history of being an anti-vaccination guy.

5110
03:46:59,560 --> 03:47:03,320
He hasn't been not that for years.

5111
03:47:03,320 --> 03:47:06,380
So this shouldn't be news to him.

5112
03:47:06,380 --> 03:47:10,480
Such a luxury for rich people to be anti-vax.

5113
03:47:10,480 --> 03:47:11,680
Such a luxury.

5114
03:47:11,680 --> 03:47:12,680
Yeah.

5115
03:47:12,680 --> 03:47:18,560
Oh, my kids go to all schools where everybody has been vaccinated, so I don't have to worry

5116
03:47:18,560 --> 03:47:19,560
about it.

5117
03:47:19,560 --> 03:47:20,560
They're not pregnant.

5118
03:47:20,560 --> 03:47:28,240
Also, this version of anti-vax, where it's like, I spaced it out over six years.

5119
03:47:28,240 --> 03:47:29,240
Fucking fuck you.

5120
03:47:29,240 --> 03:47:30,240
Yeah, it's not great either.

5121
03:47:30,240 --> 03:47:32,240
Fuck you.

5122
03:47:32,240 --> 03:47:43,460
I've established it, I think, pretty consistently, but if you're anti-vax, I hope you kill yourself

5123
03:47:43,460 --> 03:47:46,120
and then kill your children.

5124
03:47:46,120 --> 03:47:47,120
That seems hard.

5125
03:47:47,120 --> 03:47:48,920
No, that's a good order for that.

5126
03:47:48,920 --> 03:47:52,840
All right, well, we all know that our descendants are still with us.

5127
03:47:52,840 --> 03:48:01,360
We got one more clip, and this is Alex talking more about Trump's anti-vax position.

5128
03:48:01,360 --> 03:48:06,280
What I know about what he's going to be going through now for saying that, and looking at

5129
03:48:06,280 --> 03:48:09,960
the look in his eye, I guarantee you Donald Trump doesn't like seeing his friends have

5130
03:48:09,960 --> 03:48:12,040
brain-damaged kids all around him.

5131
03:48:12,040 --> 03:48:17,680
It's a large portion of people have giggling, happy 18-month-old baby boys.

5132
03:48:17,680 --> 03:48:20,000
Their blood-brain barrier is not strong as a girl's.

5133
03:48:20,000 --> 03:48:22,160
They go in to get that last round of shots.

5134
03:48:22,160 --> 03:48:24,720
Billy don't ever talk again.

5135
03:48:24,720 --> 03:48:30,440
That's why a lot of members of Congress are against vaccines, because you or your kid

5136
03:48:30,440 --> 03:48:35,120
or your grandchildren take a shot and never talk again, that'll wake some people up.

5137
03:48:35,120 --> 03:48:42,560
So I got to say it, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, and Donald Trump, they are the three presidential

5138
03:48:42,560 --> 03:48:45,800
contenders, in my view, from a position of liberty.

5139
03:48:45,800 --> 03:48:49,120
Now we have come to our own new place.

5140
03:48:49,120 --> 03:48:51,680
Yeah, we've narrowed it down.

5141
03:48:51,680 --> 03:48:53,120
And that's fucked up.

5142
03:48:53,120 --> 03:48:54,120
Yeah.

5143
03:48:54,120 --> 03:48:55,400
Because he loves Rand Paul.

5144
03:48:55,400 --> 03:49:05,280
He will very soon humiliate Ted Cruz, and he will become the biggest blowjob machine

5145
03:49:05,280 --> 03:49:06,720
for Donald Trump.

5146
03:49:06,720 --> 03:49:07,940
Which is funny.

5147
03:49:07,940 --> 03:49:08,940
But this-

5148
03:49:08,940 --> 03:49:14,040
That is the one true joy I took out of that campaign, is Ted Cruz turning into a little

5149
03:49:14,040 --> 03:49:15,040
bitch.

5150
03:49:15,040 --> 03:49:25,960
Uh, this is, like, I don't know how to say it, I was right.

5151
03:49:25,960 --> 03:49:26,960
My argument-

5152
03:49:26,960 --> 03:49:32,640
So what you're saying is that we began this episode with Dan being right, and we ended

5153
03:49:32,640 --> 03:49:34,400
it with Dan being right.

5154
03:49:34,400 --> 03:49:38,920
I think I'm right, but not the way I expected.

5155
03:49:38,920 --> 03:49:46,080
Because I predicted earlier that when Alex makes his pivot to Trump, it will be superficial.

5156
03:49:46,080 --> 03:49:53,000
It'll be about some issue that he already, it's not new.

5157
03:49:53,000 --> 03:49:54,000
It's not new.

5158
03:49:54,000 --> 03:49:55,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5159
03:49:55,000 --> 03:49:56,960
And that is what he has sort of done.

5160
03:49:56,960 --> 03:49:59,120
Now he's not the cheerleader yet.

5161
03:49:59,120 --> 03:50:03,480
He's still just saying these three guys are liberty candidates.

5162
03:50:03,480 --> 03:50:04,800
He's narrowed it down.

5163
03:50:04,800 --> 03:50:05,800
Yeah.

5164
03:50:05,800 --> 03:50:06,800
Which is-

5165
03:50:06,800 --> 03:50:09,720
Which is already fucked up enough as it is.

5166
03:50:09,720 --> 03:50:22,320
Like the candidate, I don't understand how it is that he professes to be libertarian,

5167
03:50:22,320 --> 03:50:25,680
and theoretically non-partisan.

5168
03:50:25,680 --> 03:50:30,740
And yet at the same time, every enemy is leftist.

5169
03:50:30,740 --> 03:50:34,800
Every fear comes from inclusion.

5170
03:50:34,800 --> 03:50:43,560
Every fear comes from any kind of, we should all be part of the same world, which is also

5171
03:50:43,560 --> 03:50:50,720
his professed ideology in that the globalists are trying to keep us from becoming an inclusive

5172
03:50:50,720 --> 03:50:51,720
society.

5173
03:50:51,720 --> 03:50:57,440
He wants the inclusion, but he knows that it's a globalist plot.

5174
03:50:57,440 --> 03:51:02,960
He's talked about Sanders a couple times already, and he's been like, this fucking ding-dong,

5175
03:51:02,960 --> 03:51:05,000
this asshole.

5176
03:51:05,000 --> 03:51:14,200
Which, to me, it seems like he would wind up coming down between Sanders and Rand Paul.

5177
03:51:14,200 --> 03:51:15,960
That's what Jesse Ventura does.

5178
03:51:15,960 --> 03:51:16,960
Exactly, exactly.

5179
03:51:16,960 --> 03:51:17,960
Because Jesse Ventura is pure.

5180
03:51:17,960 --> 03:51:22,080
Ventura is like, hey, Sanders or Rand Paul.

5181
03:51:22,080 --> 03:51:23,480
That's what Ventura is.

5182
03:51:23,480 --> 03:51:25,080
Jesse Ventura has a philosophy.

5183
03:51:25,080 --> 03:51:32,720
He has an ideological consistency, and Alex doesn't believe really in anything.

5184
03:51:32,720 --> 03:51:39,480
I honestly think what we're coming to, and what I've learned from listening to these

5185
03:51:39,480 --> 03:51:49,760
past three weeks or two weeks that we've covered, is he is a harsh, opportunistic asshole.

5186
03:51:49,760 --> 03:51:52,920
He wants his money.

5187
03:51:52,920 --> 03:51:54,120
He wants his money.

5188
03:51:54,120 --> 03:51:57,480
And I think he realized when Joe Biggs...

5189
03:51:57,480 --> 03:52:03,360
That's actually gonna be, when we write the screenplay for our documentary, it will be

5190
03:52:03,360 --> 03:52:06,160
the tagline is, Alex Jones.

5191
03:52:06,160 --> 03:52:07,160
He wants his money.

5192
03:52:07,160 --> 03:52:12,320
Well, we predicted earlier that it would be a thing where it's like, he's trying to get

5193
03:52:12,320 --> 03:52:17,160
the Mercers or Trump to try and come in as big money donors.

5194
03:52:17,160 --> 03:52:19,560
And that may still be the case.

5195
03:52:19,560 --> 03:52:26,160
But I think he started this million dollar campaign, and he's like, it's not happening.

5196
03:52:26,160 --> 03:52:32,720
In the meantime, we've recognized Joe Biggs went out there and everyone wanted that shirt.

5197
03:52:32,720 --> 03:52:35,800
That is a market we can fucking tap into.

5198
03:52:35,800 --> 03:52:38,240
How do we rationalize this?

5199
03:52:38,240 --> 03:52:39,760
We rationalize it.

5200
03:52:39,760 --> 03:52:41,840
There was a debate last night.

5201
03:52:41,840 --> 03:52:46,200
He said something anti-vaccination that he said a hundred times already.

5202
03:52:46,200 --> 03:52:51,220
Now it's like, fuck, we soft kill babies.

5203
03:52:51,220 --> 03:52:52,560
He's against that.

5204
03:52:52,560 --> 03:52:55,760
All right, I'm in.

5205
03:52:55,760 --> 03:52:56,760
Exactly.

5206
03:52:56,760 --> 03:52:57,760
That's so disappointing.

5207
03:52:57,760 --> 03:53:01,680
I want it to be some kind of nefarious thing.

5208
03:53:01,680 --> 03:53:03,680
It's still nefarious.

5209
03:53:03,680 --> 03:53:05,160
It's still pretty nefarious.

5210
03:53:05,160 --> 03:53:06,320
That's a good point.

5211
03:53:06,320 --> 03:53:19,880
It needs, to me, in order for us to, I don't know, I guess it's more like I feel like we

5212
03:53:19,880 --> 03:53:22,800
need a scoop.

5213
03:53:22,800 --> 03:53:28,440
I feel like we need some kind of angle that nobody's ever touched before.

5214
03:53:28,440 --> 03:53:37,280
But if it just winds up being weird, shitty opportunism, it bums me out, right?

5215
03:53:37,280 --> 03:53:39,560
Shouldn't there be some sort of Mercer money?

5216
03:53:39,560 --> 03:53:44,960
Shouldn't there be some sort of third party donor who's like, all right, now I direct

5217
03:53:44,960 --> 03:53:45,960
things.

5218
03:53:45,960 --> 03:53:49,160
It used to be the gold guy, but now it's me.

5219
03:53:49,160 --> 03:53:53,480
Well Ted Anderson is involved to this day, so that he hasn't gone.

5220
03:53:53,480 --> 03:53:57,240
I mean, gold guys are always going to be around.

5221
03:53:57,240 --> 03:54:04,380
I would say that you should take solace in knowing that no one has done as much listening

5222
03:54:04,380 --> 03:54:07,720
to his show as we have.

5223
03:54:07,720 --> 03:54:10,560
I don't take solace in that at all.

5224
03:54:10,560 --> 03:54:14,640
But we do have a scoop, whatever the case is.

5225
03:54:14,640 --> 03:54:15,640
That's true.

5226
03:54:15,640 --> 03:54:20,680
There's no reason that the Mercers are the ones who did it, or Trump money.

5227
03:54:20,680 --> 03:54:28,760
There's still a scoop here, because he didn't fucking care about Trump two days before,

5228
03:54:28,760 --> 03:54:30,880
and now he's a fucking contender.

5229
03:54:30,880 --> 03:54:35,000
Right back on an anti-vaxxer situation.

5230
03:54:35,000 --> 03:54:44,400
He's all over the place, and when he becomes the 1776 2.0 guy.

5231
03:54:44,400 --> 03:54:51,480
It's not just going to become, it's not because of things Trump said five years ago.

5232
03:54:51,480 --> 03:54:57,240
Well that's the thing that gets me, is that it seems like right now he's going off of

5233
03:54:57,240 --> 03:55:00,040
things Trump says.

5234
03:55:00,040 --> 03:55:05,140
Like he's going off of things that Trump, like Trump says something I like, so I say

5235
03:55:05,140 --> 03:55:06,800
nice things about him.

5236
03:55:06,800 --> 03:55:10,140
Trump says something I don't like, so I don't say nice things about him.

5237
03:55:10,140 --> 03:55:11,400
Trump says something I like.

5238
03:55:11,400 --> 03:55:14,320
Like that's the problem that I have.

5239
03:55:14,320 --> 03:55:22,360
It should be something that is at least consistent, and until we get to that consistent point,

5240
03:55:22,360 --> 03:55:24,320
it just seems like he's full of shit.

5241
03:55:24,320 --> 03:55:25,920
Yeah, you're a dumb-dumb.

5242
03:55:25,920 --> 03:55:27,240
There's never going to be- Fair.

5243
03:55:27,240 --> 03:55:28,240
There's never going to- Fair.

5244
03:55:28,240 --> 03:55:30,880
No, that's fair.

5245
03:55:30,880 --> 03:55:34,240
There's never going to be a point when Alex Jones is consistent.

5246
03:55:34,240 --> 03:55:35,240
Fair.

5247
03:55:35,240 --> 03:55:36,560
Yeah, he's a crazy person.

5248
03:55:36,560 --> 03:55:38,800
I don't know why, but I still- He has brain damage.

5249
03:55:38,800 --> 03:55:42,840
I still live in this world of like- He did mess.

5250
03:55:42,840 --> 03:55:49,920
I still live in the world of I believe people believe in things, and Alex doesn't.

5251
03:55:49,920 --> 03:55:53,080
You know what- And that's why you're right about that fucking

5252
03:55:53,080 --> 03:56:02,960
meme is that the consistent argument is always people believe shit, and Alex doesn't have

5253
03:56:02,960 --> 03:56:04,200
a belief system.

5254
03:56:04,200 --> 03:56:05,200
Nope.

5255
03:56:05,200 --> 03:56:09,520
Alex has elves, and then we move on.

5256
03:56:09,520 --> 03:56:10,680
He's rogue.

5257
03:56:10,680 --> 03:56:11,960
He's completely rogue.

5258
03:56:11,960 --> 03:56:14,720
Yeah, as are all of those fucking alt-right guys.

5259
03:56:14,720 --> 03:56:15,840
It doesn't matter to them.

5260
03:56:15,840 --> 03:56:17,240
They move on.

5261
03:56:17,240 --> 03:56:24,480
In the same way that in that story that Tom Arnold told, they got to get a bunch of publicity

5262
03:56:24,480 --> 03:56:30,520
out of calling Tom Arnold a pussy and then canceling the fight, and no one on their side

5263
03:56:30,520 --> 03:56:32,460
knows that they canceled the fight.

5264
03:56:32,460 --> 03:56:33,680
It just didn't happen.

5265
03:56:33,680 --> 03:56:36,120
They can say he backed out.

5266
03:56:36,120 --> 03:56:39,040
He was involved with the coordination of it.

5267
03:56:39,040 --> 03:56:40,040
Yeah.

5268
03:56:40,040 --> 03:56:41,040
It doesn't matter.

5269
03:56:41,040 --> 03:56:42,040
It doesn't matter.

5270
03:56:42,040 --> 03:56:43,040
Perception is king.

5271
03:56:43,040 --> 03:56:44,040
Yeah.

5272
03:56:44,040 --> 03:56:45,040
All of it's bullshit.

5273
03:56:45,040 --> 03:56:46,040
Everything is bullshit.

5274
03:56:46,040 --> 03:56:52,800
Anyway, we'll be back with the next stage of this investigation and other shit.

5275
03:56:52,800 --> 03:56:54,960
I don't want to talk about the present much, but-

5276
03:56:54,960 --> 03:57:02,160
Unless the present turns out to be very interesting, which so far to this circumstance it has been

5277
03:57:02,160 --> 03:57:03,160
very depressing.

5278
03:57:03,160 --> 03:57:06,600
Well, it's just like he doesn't talk about the actual things that are happening in the

5279
03:57:06,600 --> 03:57:07,600
administration.

5280
03:57:07,600 --> 03:57:08,600
No, it's been boring.

5281
03:57:08,600 --> 03:57:09,600
Yeah.

5282
03:57:09,600 --> 03:57:15,720
It's like, oh, Scaramucci's in, hey, that's because Sean Spicer was a deep state agent.

5283
03:57:15,720 --> 03:57:20,440
It would be really interesting though if he did get into, like if he did have sources

5284
03:57:20,440 --> 03:57:28,280
like Donald Trump Jr., who would get him inside information on how the dynamics of the administration

5285
03:57:28,280 --> 03:57:29,280
was working.

5286
03:57:29,280 --> 03:57:31,560
Which, by the way, this week-

5287
03:57:31,560 --> 03:57:32,560
Bananas.

5288
03:57:32,560 --> 03:57:41,720
Like this week, as this episode comes out, Jr. may have to show up in front of the Senate.

5289
03:57:41,720 --> 03:57:43,720
As will DT himself.

5290
03:57:43,720 --> 03:57:44,720
Manafort.

5291
03:57:44,720 --> 03:57:45,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5292
03:57:45,840 --> 03:57:46,840
So we'll see.

5293
03:57:46,840 --> 03:57:47,840
I mean, they're probably-

5294
03:57:47,840 --> 03:57:48,840
They won't.

5295
03:57:48,840 --> 03:57:49,840
No.

5296
03:57:49,840 --> 03:57:50,840
Of course not.

5297
03:57:50,840 --> 03:57:51,840
No.

5298
03:57:51,840 --> 03:57:52,840
They're going to be pardoned.

5299
03:57:52,840 --> 03:57:53,840
It's nonsense.

5300
03:57:53,840 --> 03:57:54,840
You get it?

5301
03:57:54,840 --> 03:57:55,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5302
03:57:55,840 --> 03:57:57,840
But hey, if you don't want to be pardoned, you should go to our website.

5303
03:57:57,840 --> 03:57:58,840
What?

5304
03:57:58,840 --> 03:57:59,840
Wait, no, no.

5305
03:57:59,840 --> 03:58:00,840
No.

5306
03:58:00,840 --> 03:58:02,400
I refuse that transition.

5307
03:58:02,400 --> 03:58:03,400
Reject.

5308
03:58:03,400 --> 03:58:04,400
Nope.

5309
03:58:04,400 --> 03:58:05,400
That was me.

5310
03:58:05,400 --> 03:58:06,400
Reject entirely.

5311
03:58:06,400 --> 03:58:07,400
It was me slightly buzzed.

5312
03:58:07,400 --> 03:58:08,400
I pivoted on the word.

5313
03:58:08,400 --> 03:58:09,400
Reject entirely.

5314
03:58:09,400 --> 03:58:15,200
If you want to reject something on a word, go to our website.

5315
03:58:15,200 --> 03:58:17,440
Our website is knowledgefight.com.

5316
03:58:17,440 --> 03:58:18,440
Check it out.

5317
03:58:18,440 --> 03:58:19,580
There's a lot of good stuff on there.

5318
03:58:19,580 --> 03:58:22,800
You can click on a button that says support the show.

5319
03:58:22,800 --> 03:58:24,060
And let me tell you something.

5320
03:58:24,060 --> 03:58:27,640
So many people have started supporting the show that it's-

5321
03:58:27,640 --> 03:58:28,840
We got a lot of wonks.

5322
03:58:28,840 --> 03:58:31,200
It's kind of mind boggling.

5323
03:58:31,200 --> 03:58:33,200
How many of you have become policy wonks and how-

5324
03:58:33,200 --> 03:58:34,320
Thank you all so much.

5325
03:58:34,320 --> 03:58:37,720
How important it is to us on so many levels.

5326
03:58:37,720 --> 03:58:43,000
And if you are not a policy wonk and you would like to be, click on that button and you will

5327
03:58:43,000 --> 03:58:44,000
be-

5328
03:58:44,000 --> 03:58:45,000
Kill Jeff Sessions.

5329
03:58:45,000 --> 03:58:46,000
Wait, hold on.

5330
03:58:46,000 --> 03:58:47,000
Wait, no.

5331
03:58:47,000 --> 03:58:48,000
Wait.

5332
03:58:48,000 --> 03:58:49,000
What?

5333
03:58:49,000 --> 03:58:50,000
Hold off on that.

5334
03:58:50,000 --> 03:58:51,000
Did we not agree on that?

5335
03:58:51,000 --> 03:58:52,000
Hold off on that.

5336
03:58:52,000 --> 03:58:53,000
Did we not agree on that pre-show?

5337
03:58:53,000 --> 03:58:54,000
You are not on brand.

5338
03:58:54,000 --> 03:58:55,000
Okay.

5339
03:58:55,000 --> 03:58:56,000
All right.

5340
03:58:56,000 --> 03:58:57,000
I'm sorry.

5341
03:58:57,000 --> 03:58:58,000
I'm sorry.

5342
03:58:58,000 --> 03:58:59,000
But if you click on that button, you will be granted access to, right now it's 10 episodes

5343
03:58:59,000 --> 03:59:00,000
of That's What They Want You To Think.

5344
03:59:00,000 --> 03:59:03,260
And if you're watching this on the Marty DeRosa's Conspiracy Theory podcast, a little bonus

5345
03:59:03,260 --> 03:59:04,260
for your ass.

5346
03:59:04,260 --> 03:59:07,040
Marty, friend of the show and very, very funny comedian.

5347
03:59:07,040 --> 03:59:11,500
And there are other episodes that will be added eventually once I find them in my hard

5348
03:59:11,500 --> 03:59:12,500
drive.

5349
03:59:12,500 --> 03:59:16,360
I have an external hard drive that has other episodes that I can't find.

5350
03:59:16,360 --> 03:59:17,360
Right.

5351
03:59:17,360 --> 03:59:18,360
But they're there somewhere.

5352
03:59:18,360 --> 03:59:19,360
We'll figure it out.

5353
03:59:19,360 --> 03:59:20,360
But if you-

5354
03:59:20,360 --> 03:59:23,720
If you want to follow us on Twitter, it's at knowledge underscore fights.

5355
03:59:23,720 --> 03:59:24,720
And we're on Facebook.

5356
03:59:24,720 --> 03:59:25,720
Facebook.

5357
03:59:25,720 --> 03:59:30,520
All right, this is the evidence that we've been drinking wine this entire episode.

5358
03:59:30,520 --> 03:59:31,520
I did that last episode.

5359
03:59:31,520 --> 03:59:32,680
You don't even remember it.

5360
03:59:32,680 --> 03:59:33,680
That's a good point.

5361
03:59:33,680 --> 03:59:36,640
That's because we've been drinking wine this entire episode.

5362
03:59:36,640 --> 03:59:38,320
Please give us a rating on Facebook.

5363

5364
03:59:39,320 --> 03:59:40,320
It's helpful.

5365
03:59:40,320 --> 03:59:41,320
Good iTunes.

5366
03:59:41,320 --> 03:59:42,320
Give us a rating.

5367
03:59:42,320 --> 03:59:44,040
Make sure people know us.

5368
03:59:44,040 --> 03:59:49,000
There's something about their algorithm where if you give us some stars, they'll be like,

5369
03:59:49,000 --> 03:59:50,680
yeah, fucking find them.

5370
03:59:50,680 --> 03:59:51,680
Indeed.

5371
03:59:51,680 --> 03:59:52,800
Beyond that, I'd like to apologize.

5372
03:59:52,800 --> 03:59:54,720
This episode has been this long.

5373
03:59:54,720 --> 03:59:55,720
Jesus Christ.

5374
03:59:55,720 --> 03:59:56,720
I think we-

5375
03:59:56,720 --> 03:59:57,720
How long has it been?

5376
03:59:57,720 --> 03:59:58,720
We are at four hours.

5377
03:59:58,720 --> 04:00:01,200
This is the longest episode so far.

5378
04:00:01,200 --> 04:00:02,200
Not true.

5379
04:00:02,200 --> 04:00:03,200
Jesus Christ.

5380
04:00:03,200 --> 04:00:04,200
Yes, it is.

5381
04:00:04,200 --> 04:00:05,200
Really?

5382
04:00:05,200 --> 04:00:06,200
Yeah.

5383
04:00:06,200 --> 04:00:07,200
We've not breached four hours.

5384
04:00:07,200 --> 04:00:08,200
You've not breached four?

5385
04:00:08,200 --> 04:00:09,200
No.

5386
04:00:09,200 --> 04:00:10,200
Dude, you-

5387
04:00:10,200 --> 04:00:11,200
The Joe Rogan was the closest, I think.

5388
04:00:11,200 --> 04:00:12,200
You called it-

5389
04:00:12,200 --> 04:00:13,200
It's close.

5390
04:00:13,200 --> 04:00:14,760
You called it 3.15 and I was like, nah, this ain't happening.

5391
04:00:14,760 --> 04:00:15,880
It's coming to four.

5392
04:00:15,880 --> 04:00:19,120
I think if you had not disrupted me so many times-

5393
04:00:19,120 --> 04:00:21,120
No.

5394
04:00:21,120 --> 04:00:24,320
Don't-

5395
04:00:24,320 --> 04:00:28,720
Don't pretend this wasn't on purpose.

5396
04:00:28,720 --> 04:00:32,120
I was going to make this episode four hours no matter what happened.

5397
04:00:32,120 --> 04:00:36,680
Look, it's the wine, it's the good times, and it's the truth, guys.

5398
04:00:36,680 --> 04:00:37,680
Policy wonks.

5399
04:00:37,680 --> 04:00:39,240
We love you all very much.

5400
04:00:39,240 --> 04:00:40,240
We don't love-

5401
04:00:40,240 --> 04:00:41,240
I'll tell you there's somebody we don't love.

5402
04:00:41,240 --> 04:00:42,240
God damn it.

5403
04:00:42,240 --> 04:00:43,240
Damn it.

5404
04:00:43,240 --> 04:00:44,240
Damn.

5405
04:00:44,240 --> 04:00:45,240
You are ruining the ending bit.

5406
04:00:45,240 --> 04:00:46,240
I was trying to help.

5407
04:00:46,240 --> 04:00:47,240
I was trying to help you asshole.

5408
04:00:47,240 --> 04:00:48,240
You asshole.

5409
04:00:48,240 --> 04:00:49,240
I was trying to help you asshole.

5410
04:00:49,240 --> 04:00:58,160
I was trying to be like, oh shit, there's an inroad to get to John Rappaport.

5411
04:00:58,160 --> 04:01:00,040
Do you know who doesn't help us?

5412
04:01:00,040 --> 04:01:01,200
This one guy.

5413
04:01:01,200 --> 04:01:02,200
What one guy?

5414
04:01:02,200 --> 04:01:03,200
This one guy.

5415
04:01:03,200 --> 04:01:04,200
Who is he?

5416
04:01:04,200 --> 04:01:05,200
Fuck.

5417
04:01:05,200 --> 04:01:06,200
I ran into the-

5418
04:01:06,200 --> 04:01:07,200
Is he young or is he old?

5419
04:01:07,200 --> 04:01:08,200
He's really old.

5420
04:01:08,200 --> 04:01:09,200
He's really old?

5421
04:01:09,200 --> 04:01:10,800
I was at this fucking anti-AIDS conference.

5422
04:01:10,800 --> 04:01:12,800
I was at this conference about how AIDS isn't real.

5423
04:01:12,800 --> 04:01:13,800
I'm already out.

5424
04:01:13,800 --> 04:01:14,800
I hung out with him.

5425
04:01:14,800 --> 04:01:15,800
He was really cool.

5426
04:01:15,800 --> 04:01:16,800
We did shots of JMo.

5427
04:01:16,800 --> 04:01:17,800
It was super cool.

5428
04:01:17,800 --> 04:01:18,800
What about him?

5429
04:01:18,800 --> 04:01:22,320
At the end of the night, I gotta be honest, I skipped out on his tab.

5430
04:01:22,320 --> 04:01:24,600
This is the best the bit has gone so far.

5431
04:01:24,600 --> 04:01:27,120
I skipped out on his tab.

5432
04:01:27,120 --> 04:01:28,480
He said he was going to the bathroom.

5433
04:01:28,480 --> 04:01:32,240
I was like, I'll stick around here.

5434
04:01:32,240 --> 04:01:33,240
What did you say about this guy?

5435
04:01:33,240 --> 04:01:35,480
I said, fuck you John Rappaport.

5436
04:01:35,480 --> 04:01:36,480
Andy in Kansas.

5437
04:01:36,480 --> 04:01:37,480
You're on the air.

5438
04:01:37,480 --> 04:01:38,480
Thanks for holding.

5439
04:01:38,480 --> 04:01:39,480
Hello Alex.

5440
04:01:39,480 --> 04:01:40,480
I'm a first time caller.

5441
04:01:40,480 --> 04:01:41,480
I'm a huge fan.

04:01:41,480 --> 04:01:42,480
I love your work.

5443
04:01:42,480 --> 04:01:49,480
