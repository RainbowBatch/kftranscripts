00:00.000 --> 00:02.160
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding.

00:04.160 --> 00:07.300
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan, I love your work.

00:07.300 --> 00:07.800
I love you.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.600
Hey everybody, welcome back to Knowledge Fight, I'm Dan.

00:09.600 --> 00:10.100
I'm Jordan!

00:10.100 --> 00:14.400
We are a couple dudes who like to sit around and drink novelty beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

00:14.400 --> 00:19.500
Is there a twist today, unspecific to the twists of yesterday?

00:19.500 --> 00:20.700
Uh, pfft, I don't know what that is.

00:20.700 --> 00:23.900
I don't know, I was trying to go with yesteryear and I was like, we haven't been doing this for-

00:23.900 --> 00:24.700
Strange phrasing.

00:24.700 --> 00:26.800
Yestermonth? I don't know, I got nothing.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.600
Today's novelty beverage is red wine.

00:28.600 --> 00:30.700
Hahahaha!

00:30.700 --> 00:35.000
We are going back to our roots, the show originally was us drinking wine and talking about Alex Jones,

00:35.000 --> 00:38.700
we had to settle that down for a little bit, but we wanted to go back to the roots!

00:38.700 --> 00:45.000
Uh, and the reason was given to me by Dan as, we're gonna need to drink wine for this one.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.100
We might need to brace ourselves, steal our reserves.

00:48.100 --> 00:48.800
Right, right, right.

00:48.800 --> 00:49.800
That's not the expression, but-

00:49.800 --> 00:50.300
No.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.600
Um, look, I think that we've been getting-

00:52.600 --> 00:54.000
Steal our reserves.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.600
You know, we got a lot of food squared away, we need to cover it in steel.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.100
Right, and you know nothing about Alex Jones.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.600
I don't know anything about Alex Jones.

01:00.600 --> 01:03.800
Premise of the show, I know a lot about Alex Jones, Jordan over there does not know much about him.

01:03.800 --> 01:05.300
I'm just excited we're drinking again.

01:05.300 --> 01:05.800
Amen.

01:05.800 --> 01:11.900
Uh, one of the reasons was I was listening back to our last episode and I realized I was way too mad about, uh,

01:11.900 --> 01:16.600
the people who were posting the Bon Iver video meme of Alex Jones because-

01:16.600 --> 01:17.700
You were very pissed.

01:17.700 --> 01:19.100
I was right, but I was-

01:19.100 --> 01:20.700
Hahahaha!

01:20.700 --> 01:22.300
I was way too mad.

01:22.300 --> 01:25.400
And I don't like that, I wanna- that's not what this show's supposed to be.

01:25.400 --> 01:30.900
I don't wanna turn into some Alex Jones facsimile where I'm screaming and everybody's doing this wrong and all this.

01:30.900 --> 01:31.700
Oh, that's true.

01:31.700 --> 01:36.800
I felt really, like, self-conscious about it and I'm like, well, the only solution is let's get drunk.

01:36.800 --> 01:42.200
Well, and I mean, I have actually been having the same kind of thoughts recently where it's like,

01:42.200 --> 01:44.900
are we just becoming the anti-Alex Jones?

01:44.900 --> 01:50.900
Like, there's been a couple of things where I've noticed, like, listening back, uh, it's like,

01:50.900 --> 01:52.700
oh, that's exactly what he does.

01:52.700 --> 01:55.900
But we don't build up false narratives for a specific purpose.

01:55.900 --> 01:57.200
You know, like, I don't think we do that.

01:57.200 --> 02:00.400
But we tear down false narratives for a specific purpose.

02:00.400 --> 02:01.300
Which is-

02:01.300 --> 02:03.200
So we're just the anti-Alex Jones.

02:03.200 --> 02:06.400
We're tearing down those narratives for the sake of tearing them down because they're lies.

02:06.400 --> 02:06.700
Right.

02:06.700 --> 02:07.500
So I think it's okay-

02:07.500 --> 02:08.300
We're like Reagan.

02:08.300 --> 02:09.000
Right.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.500
Tear down that lie wall.

02:11.500 --> 02:13.300
Um, but, uh, to get back to that-

02:13.300 --> 02:15.900
God, I hope David Hasselhoff closes out this episode.

02:15.900 --> 02:17.700
He definitely will, he comes in on the money bomb.

02:17.700 --> 02:18.700
Really? Okay.

02:18.700 --> 02:20.200
Hahahaha!

02:20.200 --> 02:23.700
So, uh, like, I want to also say that, like I said-

02:23.700 --> 02:25.900
And now we have Baywatch star David Hasselhoff.

02:25.900 --> 02:28.400
And, uh, D'Errico.

02:28.400 --> 02:31.700
Donald D'Errico on backup vocals.

02:31.700 --> 02:37.000
Um, I want to say that about that, uh, Bon Iver video, I'm totally right.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.200
Uh, Alex Jones just announced-

02:40.200 --> 02:43.100
That's twice we have confirmed Dan is right.

02:43.100 --> 02:44.400
Uh, self-confirmed.

02:44.400 --> 02:46.600
Well, Alex Jones, uh, just at the end of last week-

02:46.600 --> 02:47.100
That's true.

02:47.100 --> 02:53.100
He announced a $20,000 contest for people to make parody versions of this parody song about him.

02:53.100 --> 02:53.600
Yep.

02:53.600 --> 02:57.900
And that's what I'm saying he's going to do, that's what he does all the time with this shit.

02:57.900 --> 03:02.400
No, you have been proven right, but, uh, you know, it's a little gauche to talk about it yourself.

03:02.400 --> 03:04.600
You should've given me a little cue-

03:04.600 --> 03:05.100
Calm down.

03:05.100 --> 03:06.600
I would've been like, Dan, you're so right.

03:06.600 --> 03:16.600
The reason I brought it up and maybe forced a self-congratulatory note is because I know exactly what the plan is for what this contest is going to achieve.

03:16.600 --> 03:24.600
He's basically going to have all the- I mean, he's posted all the lyrics of the parody song on his website, on Infowars.com.

03:24.600 --> 03:32.600
And what he's going to have people do, and the winner who ends up winning this $10,000 of the $20,000, because it's broken down, it's three prizes.

03:32.600 --> 03:36.100
One for best parody, uh, that's $10,000.

03:36.100 --> 03:36.600
Right.

03:36.600 --> 03:41.600
$5,000 will be awarded to the person who films it in the weirdest- or best location.

03:41.600 --> 03:43.600
Their video is in the- I don't know what that means.

03:43.600 --> 03:44.600
My-

03:44.600 --> 03:45.100
Congress?

03:45.100 --> 03:45.600
Is that a-

03:45.600 --> 03:46.100
I don't know.

03:46.100 --> 03:48.600
Is that a way to avoid paying out that $5,000?

03:48.600 --> 03:49.100
Probably.

03:49.100 --> 03:49.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:49.600 --> 03:52.100
So, but like, I know what he's going to do.

03:52.100 --> 03:53.600
All the lyrics are there-

03:53.600 --> 03:56.100
My sex dungeon is the weirdest location.

03:56.100 --> 03:56.600
It's super weird.

03:56.600 --> 03:59.600
Yeah, that's super weird, but I'm not giving you five grand for it.

03:59.600 --> 04:10.100
It is a way that he is going to essentially get people to try and reinforce the lines in that song that people are making fun of.

04:10.100 --> 04:10.600
Yeah.

04:10.600 --> 04:17.600
So it'll be like, uh, we love our Somalis, and then, you know, flash up on the screen something about how Somalis kill people.

04:17.600 --> 04:18.100
Yeah.

04:18.100 --> 04:23.600
It's going to be a thing where he takes his propaganda and it's reinforced through the use of that parody song.

04:23.600 --> 04:24.100
Right.

04:24.100 --> 04:25.600
It's like, oh, they're making fun of all this stuff.

04:25.600 --> 04:26.600
All of it's true.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.100
They do want to eat babies.

04:28.100 --> 04:28.600
Yeah.

04:28.600 --> 04:29.100
Stuff like that.

04:29.100 --> 04:31.600
And it's like, you guys are fighting a losing battle.

04:31.600 --> 04:35.600
So, anyway, it's going to be a bummer.

04:35.600 --> 04:40.600
But the good news is way less people will see that parody version than the Bon Iver version.

04:40.600 --> 04:41.100
That's definitely true.

04:41.100 --> 04:43.600
So there's something to be said for that.

04:43.600 --> 04:44.600
I don't know.

04:44.600 --> 04:49.100
Let's get into greener pastures and happy things. I'd like to give a shout out to a couple of new donators.

04:49.100 --> 04:50.600
Oh, shit. A couple?

04:50.600 --> 04:54.600
That's right. I'd like to give a shout out to our new friend, Rex. What's going on out there?

04:54.600 --> 04:55.600
I'm a policy wonk.

04:55.600 --> 04:56.600
Thank you for donating, Rex.

04:56.600 --> 04:59.600
If you're Rex Tillerson, you have to let us know.

04:59.600 --> 05:00.100
It's not. It's Rex.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.100
How dare you, Rex Tillerson?

05:02.100 --> 05:06.600
It's Rex from our favorite pro wrestling themed punk band, the Razor Ramones.

05:06.600 --> 05:09.100
Alright, well then, never mind, Rex. I'm a huge fan of yours.

05:09.100 --> 05:12.600
Yeah, you're the best Rex of the Rexes we've mentioned.

05:12.600 --> 05:15.600
Also, I'd like to give a shout out to our other new donator. What's up, Anthony?

05:15.600 --> 05:16.600
I'm a policy wonk.

05:16.600 --> 05:17.600
Welcome aboard.

05:17.600 --> 05:21.600
If that's Anthony Wiener, I'm just going to do this every single time you give a first name.

05:21.600 --> 05:27.600
It's actually Anthony Kumiya, host of the fourth hour of the Alex Jones program periodically.

05:27.600 --> 05:28.600
I don't know.

05:28.600 --> 05:30.600
Anyway, Jordan, let's get things started.

05:30.600 --> 05:35.600
I like the idea that Infowars employees actually stealth donate to us.

05:35.600 --> 05:39.600
Just going like, please get us out of this. He won't let us leave.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.600
He won't let us leave. Just take him down. Somebody.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.600
Only you can destroy him.

05:43.600 --> 05:48.600
Today, we're going to be going over Investigation, the eleventh installment of the Investigation,

05:48.600 --> 05:53.600
where we go through 2015 and find out what the fuck happened to make Alex Jones go crazy.

05:53.600 --> 05:57.600
And today, we'll be going through September 6th to September 17th.

05:57.600 --> 06:00.600
This is, this is inexplicable, right?

06:00.600 --> 06:03.600
Like, when did this, this started in June?

06:03.600 --> 06:05.600
What, our, yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:05.600 --> 06:10.600
Our investigation began June 15th, the day that Donald Trump announced his candidacy.

06:10.600 --> 06:13.600
How is this still, how is this still going on? Shouldn't it be over by now?

06:13.600 --> 06:15.600
It's very, I expected it to be.

06:15.600 --> 06:19.600
Like, especially with his, his full on, like, now he's, he's going,

06:19.600 --> 06:22.600
sovereignty, sovereignty, sir, blah, blah, blah, you know, that whole thing.

06:22.600 --> 06:23.600
You mean in 2017?

06:23.600 --> 06:24.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.600
Shouldn't he be, shouldn't he be on the train by now?

06:26.600 --> 06:27.600
What's going on?

06:27.600 --> 06:30.600
You'd think he would have made some sort of substantial move, and we just have not seen that yet.

06:30.600 --> 06:31.600
No, not at all!

06:31.600 --> 06:36.600
No, today we're going to be going over, like I said, September 6th to the 17th.

06:36.600 --> 06:41.600
The reason that's important is the end of his big money bomb, which we've discussed,

06:41.600 --> 06:47.600
and it's what I have speculated is the opportunity for bizarro money to come flowing into the show.

06:47.600 --> 06:48.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:48.600 --> 06:51.600
I think that might, I have speculated that might be the case. I don't know, we'll see.

06:51.600 --> 06:58.600
So does he get into, like, a tube and a lot of one dollar bills kind of get vacuumed around him?

06:58.600 --> 06:59.600
You know, like one of those shows?

06:59.600 --> 07:00.600
The big air jets?

07:00.600 --> 07:01.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:01.600 --> 07:02.600
It would be better.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.600
He has to grab as many of them as he can in order to...

07:04.600 --> 07:07.600
Not Larry Nichols, I know you have lung cancer, but get in the tube.

07:07.600 --> 07:11.600
If you want your bills covered, get in the tube.

07:11.600 --> 07:12.600
I don't know. It would be better.

07:12.600 --> 07:16.600
That's way more fun than, don't give out ten thousand dollar prizes.

07:16.600 --> 07:17.600
No.

07:17.600 --> 07:21.600
Apply somebody out, put them in a tube, and throw one dollar bills at them the whole time.

07:21.600 --> 07:22.600
That'd be perfect.

07:22.600 --> 07:23.600
That'd be great.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.600
I would be way more happy with that than ten grand.

07:25.600 --> 07:27.600
I probably would, too, for the story, for the experience.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, of course.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.600
Money's just money. You can't take it with you when you go.

07:31.600 --> 07:34.600
And seeing as how we're all going in, like, ten to fifteen years max.

07:34.600 --> 07:35.600
Oh, that seems high.

07:35.600 --> 07:36.600
Oh, yeah.

07:36.600 --> 07:42.600
But you know what? Before we go, before we die, everyone needs to listen to this out of context drop from Alex Jones.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.600
God bless you, man. I'm sorry for your son.

07:44.600 --> 07:48.600
They didn't get his soul, though.

07:48.600 --> 07:55.600
And see, I don't know how that works when they brain damage a baby, and they never obtain full consciousness.

07:55.600 --> 07:59.600
I guess that soul just ends up when they die going right to God, so in a way it's a reprieve.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.600
I can't judge.

08:01.600 --> 08:03.600
See, the globalists know a lot of this stuff.

08:03.600 --> 08:13.600
I wonder if they wouldn't be killing, brain killing kids, soft killing them, mind killing them, if they thought they weren't still getting the soul, because that's what they really want.

08:13.600 --> 08:20.600
So maybe they think when they're all brain damaged and get all crazed and then get older that they'll get smart enough to get corrupted and maybe possessed.

08:20.600 --> 08:26.600
I don't know. I mean, I'm trying to figure out why these demons, from whatever dimension they come from, want to brain damage the kids.

08:26.600 --> 08:30.600
Because I know God doesn't damn people to hell that never were conscious.

08:30.600 --> 08:32.600
I don't know. It's just food for thought.

08:32.600 --> 08:33.600
Food for thought.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.600
Why is that food for thought?

08:35.600 --> 08:36.600
I don't know.

08:36.600 --> 08:43.600
Also, I love the mind killer reference to Gang Gang Dance. Everybody knows that.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.600
I'm certain that's what it was.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.600
Yeah, exactly. It's a great song.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.600
Jordan, I completely fucked up.

08:49.600 --> 08:53.600
I know. The Bon Iver video was great.

08:53.600 --> 08:58.600
No, I forgot that I had another thing I wanted to discuss before we got into our main episode.

08:58.600 --> 09:03.600
So guys, forgive me, but I have another clip that we need to listen to, because it's great.

09:03.600 --> 09:07.600
Recently, I don't have permission to play this, but I'm going to anyway. I hope he doesn't sue me.

09:07.600 --> 09:08.600
All right.

09:08.600 --> 09:13.600
Recently, Jimmy Pardo on Never Not Funny had Tom Arnold as a guest.

09:13.600 --> 09:19.600
And Tom Arnold had a very interesting story about some of the people that are involved in our universe.

09:19.600 --> 09:20.600
Okay.

09:20.600 --> 09:21.600
Alex Jones comes up in this clip.

09:21.600 --> 09:22.600
Yeah.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.600
Mike Cernovich comes up in this clip.

09:24.600 --> 09:29.600
And alleged Nazi Jesse James comes up in this clip.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.600
This, when I heard this...

09:31.600 --> 09:32.600
Sandra Bullock, also alleged Nazi.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.600
No, no, no, no, no, no.

09:34.600 --> 09:35.600
Come on.

09:35.600 --> 09:38.600
When I heard this, I squealed with delight, and I want to play this.

09:38.600 --> 09:43.600
For those of you out in the world who do not have Never Not Funny, don't get the episodes.

09:43.600 --> 09:46.600
Please enjoy Tom Arnold being cool as shit.

09:46.600 --> 09:48.600
Well, here's what happened. Here's last week.

09:48.600 --> 09:55.600
This alt-right guy, white supremacist guy, challenges me to a fight.

09:55.600 --> 09:59.600
He's like, oh, I'd go good. We'll do it for a charity, because I do these charity boxing matches.

09:59.600 --> 10:04.600
I found my old rabbi who made 300 grand for Ben Teshuvah.

10:04.600 --> 10:06.600
I go, I will fight you for money.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.600
Good. We'll take your fans.

10:08.600 --> 10:14.600
And then all of a sudden this guy named Jesse James horns in and says, I'll represent Mike Cernovich, is the guy's name.

10:14.600 --> 10:15.600
Oh, that idiot.

10:15.600 --> 10:16.600
Yeah, yeah.

10:16.600 --> 10:19.600
And Jesse James goes, I will fight Tom Arnold as a pussy. I'll fight.

10:19.600 --> 10:20.600
And I go, wait a minute.

10:20.600 --> 10:27.600
Are you the Jesse James that cheated on his awesome wife with the stripper with the swastika tattoo and lost his family?

10:27.600 --> 10:31.600
Because there's a lot of Jesse James out there. I don't know who's who. Apparently it was.

10:31.600 --> 10:34.600
I go, oh, good. That'll be even better, because I know I'll kick your ass.

10:34.600 --> 10:38.600
And by the way, that'll make us more money, so let's do this thing.

10:38.600 --> 10:39.600
Okay.

10:39.600 --> 10:44.600
And so then I get up. Joe Carter has a producer, director. He's helped set it up.

10:44.600 --> 10:47.600
Like, this is really happening. We're going to do it at the Beverly Hilton.

10:47.600 --> 10:54.600
We're going to make a million dollars to help Gold Star families and a post-traumatic stress organization.

10:54.600 --> 11:04.600
It's great. It's great fun. And they go on that Infowars show with them and say I'm a pussy and whatever.

11:04.600 --> 11:07.600
And they challenge me. I'm like, hey, they're promoting this. This is awesome.

11:07.600 --> 11:13.600
And, you know, all his fans are kind of calling me names and this is just great, you know.

11:13.600 --> 11:15.600
And then they puss out.

11:15.600 --> 11:17.600
Why do they puss out, Tom?

11:17.600 --> 11:27.600
Oh, because they realized that everything they do, like Jesse James now sells guns.

11:27.600 --> 11:31.600
And that service guy, he wrote a book called Guerrilla Man or something.

11:31.600 --> 11:37.600
Like, it's about, he says there's also this thing as day rape and, man, they're pussies now.

11:37.600 --> 11:46.600
Everything they do, if they were on video getting their ass kicked by me, which wouldn't happen,

11:46.600 --> 11:54.600
just like a rabbi, unfortunately, then everything they say means nothing.

11:54.600 --> 12:00.600
And that's what will really happen. And so they would lose everything. So they wist out on that.

12:00.600 --> 12:03.600
That's slightly different than the version that Mike Cernovich tells.

12:03.600 --> 12:04.600
A little bit.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.600
Also, I believe it way more.

12:06.600 --> 12:15.600
Absolutely. Also, I'll tell you this, we get to use that clip, part of a headline to show that I was emceeing at Zany's.

12:15.600 --> 12:19.600
And he talked shit about me for 20 minutes, so come at me, Pardo!

12:19.600 --> 12:24.600
Sure. Alright, we got the implicit go-ahead.

12:24.600 --> 12:31.600
Also, how great would that be if we just end up in some sort of bizarre feud about using a clip of Tom Arnold talking shit on Cernovich?

12:31.600 --> 12:39.600
Ah, but I mean, there's a couple things in there that I fucking love, and that is that Tom Arnold does realize that Mike Cernovich,

12:39.600 --> 12:46.600
going on Infowars and calling Tom Arnold a pussy after they had already agreed to have a celebrity boxing match,

12:46.600 --> 12:50.600
is just another version of promotion. He gets it. He gets that.

12:50.600 --> 12:51.600
Pro wrestling.

12:51.600 --> 12:54.600
And he perfectly assesses why they couldn't follow through.

12:54.600 --> 13:03.600
If Tom Arnold doesn't have his shit beat out of him, then, like you said, the whole game is over.

13:03.600 --> 13:04.600
Even if it's close.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.600
Like, oh.

13:06.600 --> 13:08.600
Even if it's close, it's a disaster for Cernovich.

13:08.600 --> 13:16.600
Imagine you got beat up by Tom Arnold. You got beat up by the star of The Stupids.

13:16.600 --> 13:19.600
If I did, I wouldn't feel bad about it. It would probably be like, eh.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.600
I would do it for the experience.

13:21.600 --> 13:22.600
I probably would.

13:22.600 --> 13:23.600
That would be fun.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.600
Do I get to go into a money tube afterwards?

13:25.600 --> 13:28.600
Anyway, I just like bringing... Yeah, you do.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.600
His rabbi has that set up on the side of the stage.

13:31.600 --> 13:34.600
Is that a stealth racist thing about Jews?

13:34.600 --> 13:39.600
It wasn't, but now I realize it sounds bad. Oh well.

13:39.600 --> 13:46.600
Anyway, I just like to bring up any time in pop culture we get evidence that these dudes are wack as fuck.

13:46.600 --> 13:47.600
Yeah.

13:47.600 --> 13:52.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Behind the scenes, they had already agreed to it, is what his point is.

13:52.600 --> 13:57.600
And then they back out. That is the most beta cuck move you can do.

13:57.600 --> 14:03.600
Especially Mike Cernovich challenging him and then getting biker Jesse James to stand in for him.

14:03.600 --> 14:04.600
Right.

14:04.600 --> 14:05.600
I use you as tribute.

14:05.600 --> 14:06.600
Right, right, right.

14:06.600 --> 14:07.600
Whatever, yeah.

14:07.600 --> 14:08.600
Like some sort of Game of Thrones shit.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.600
He wasn't calling the mountain, you know.

14:10.600 --> 14:11.600
Yeah, exactly.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.600
So, let's get to the episode, Jordan.

14:13.600 --> 14:14.600
Yes, let's do it.

14:14.600 --> 14:17.600
We've had our fun, now let's get shit-faced and talk shit.

14:17.600 --> 14:18.600
Yeah.

14:18.600 --> 14:20.600
We're going to start on September 6th.

14:20.600 --> 14:27.600
And that is a Sunday show, so we know that Alex Jones likes to launch soft narratives on his Sunday shows.

14:27.600 --> 14:32.600
And I feel like we've done a decent job of saying where we left off.

14:32.600 --> 14:36.600
The money bomb is coming up. Alex Jones is clearly needing money at the end of the fiscal year.

14:36.600 --> 14:38.600
He needs to try and raise a million dollars.

14:38.600 --> 14:44.600
And at this point, he has only said basically that he likes what Trump is saying, but he doesn't trust him.

14:44.600 --> 14:45.600
Still loves Rand Paul.

14:45.600 --> 14:46.600
Yeah.

14:46.600 --> 14:47.600
There we go. We're up to speed.

14:47.600 --> 14:51.600
This September 6th, we're going to start exactly how Alex Jones starts the show.

14:51.600 --> 14:54.600
Every day I start the broadcast and I'm just honest with you.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.600
Wow, we got a lot of news.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.600
And usually I cover about 20% of it.

14:58.600 --> 14:59.600
That is honest.

14:59.600 --> 15:00.600
Some days I cover 60, 70% of it.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.600
Every once in a while I cover 90-something percent of it.

15:02.600 --> 15:03.600
Nope.

15:03.600 --> 15:04.600
Usually you cover about...

15:04.600 --> 15:05.600
Days, one of the days, I really should cover all of it.

15:05.600 --> 15:06.600
Eight percent of it?

15:06.600 --> 15:08.600
Maybe. Maybe eight.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.600
Yeah. Maybe eight headboxes.

15:10.600 --> 15:13.600
Because when you look at this world, there are two types of people when you boil it all down.

15:13.600 --> 15:16.600
There's different subgroups, but there's dogs and there's cats.

15:16.600 --> 15:17.600
All right. Well, kill yourself.

15:17.600 --> 15:20.600
And I got this article right here at the National Post.

15:20.600 --> 15:25.600
Your cat doesn't love you, scientific studies show.

15:25.600 --> 15:33.600
I don't need a scientific study to show me that my cat, and I do have one cat and two dogs, does not love me.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.600
Because no animal has ever loved you.

15:35.600 --> 15:40.600
It only wants to pretend I'm its mother and make biscuits on my stomach in an infantile manner.

15:40.600 --> 15:43.600
But it could care less if I fell down and died tomorrow.

15:43.600 --> 15:48.600
It doesn't have anxiety when I'm gone, except it wants to bitch and gripe and ask for food.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.600
It wants a free handout.

15:50.600 --> 15:55.600
My dogs on the other hand would basically die and have heart attacks if something happened to me.

15:55.600 --> 15:56.600
And that's clear.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.600
And it's that spiritual connection.

15:58.600 --> 16:03.600
It's that honorableness of the dog, which isn't perfect, but it has honor.

16:03.600 --> 16:09.600
Silly and ignorant, but has guts and guts is enough, is why I'm a dog person and not a cat person.

16:09.600 --> 16:10.600
Great.

16:10.600 --> 16:11.600
What was that?

16:11.600 --> 16:13.600
And people out there think they're getting ahead being cat people.

16:13.600 --> 16:14.600
Oh, it's still going?

16:14.600 --> 16:16.600
Folks that think they're getting ahead not caring about other folks.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.600
You think you're cool, only caring about yourself.

16:18.600 --> 16:19.600
You're an idiot.

16:19.600 --> 16:20.600
Yeah.

16:20.600 --> 16:23.600
It's like people that get in a hot tub and take a crap.

16:23.600 --> 16:26.600
And I hate to be gross here, but you think of getting away with it.

16:26.600 --> 16:27.600
Go to the bathroom.

16:27.600 --> 16:29.600
Who are you hanging out with?

16:29.600 --> 16:31.600
And you're crapping on everyone else, you're crapping on yourself.

16:31.600 --> 16:34.600
And these are just elementary understandings here.

16:34.600 --> 16:39.600
Cats are not pack animals unless you look at lions in Africa and they still feed on each other.

16:39.600 --> 16:41.600
Unless you look at the cats who are pack animals.

16:41.600 --> 16:44.600
Dogs are creatures of honor, first and foremost.

16:44.600 --> 16:45.600
Amen.

16:45.600 --> 16:46.600
Amen.

16:46.600 --> 16:49.600
If I had to have an archetypal totem animal, it would be the dog.

16:49.600 --> 16:50.600
No.

16:50.600 --> 16:51.600
Cats are cute.

16:51.600 --> 16:52.600
Cats are funny.

16:52.600 --> 16:56.600
But make no mistake, they won't be there for you when you're in a jam.

16:56.600 --> 17:01.600
And if somebody comes in your house and attacks you, they're not going to stand up for you.

17:01.600 --> 17:02.600
Dogs will.

17:02.600 --> 17:06.600
You don't hear about cops going to people's houses and shooting their cats, do you?

17:06.600 --> 17:08.600
It's the dog because they're not cowards.

17:08.600 --> 17:13.600
Even if they're little or they're big, they stand up because they love you.

17:13.600 --> 17:19.600
And our society is imploding because we're becoming a cat society, not a dog society.

17:19.600 --> 17:23.600
So this is Alex Jones trying to make a point about the world,

17:23.600 --> 17:28.600
while at the same time trying to work out some material for a weekend he's doing in a shitty club.

17:28.600 --> 17:31.600
I was going to say, this is a shitty 80s hack bit, right?

17:31.600 --> 17:32.600
Yeah, basically.

17:32.600 --> 17:35.600
Y'all know the difference between dogs and cats.

17:35.600 --> 17:36.600
Yeah, man.

17:36.600 --> 17:38.600
Cats on one side, they be like this.

17:38.600 --> 17:39.600
Yeah.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.600
Yeah, you said it.

17:40.600 --> 17:42.600
Dogs over here, they be walking like this.

17:42.600 --> 17:43.600
Oh, man, that's the truth.

17:43.600 --> 17:44.600
Oh, God, I love Def Jam.

17:44.600 --> 17:45.600
That's the truth.

17:45.600 --> 17:46.600
I love Def Jam comedy.

17:46.600 --> 17:51.600
That is like, that is terrible hacky nonsense.

17:51.600 --> 17:52.600
Yeah.

17:52.600 --> 17:53.600
And look, I got a cat.

17:53.600 --> 17:56.600
I know she doesn't really love me, but we have a complicated kind of love.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.600
You know, that's how cats and dogs are.

17:58.600 --> 17:59.600
Dogs are simple.

17:59.600 --> 18:00.600
Cats are complex.

18:00.600 --> 18:01.600
There we go.

18:01.600 --> 18:02.600
I don't know.

18:02.600 --> 18:03.600
Now I'm getting into a hacky bit.

18:03.600 --> 18:06.600
Yeah, damn, there's two kinds of people in the world.

18:06.600 --> 18:07.600
Oh, boy.

18:07.600 --> 18:08.600
People who explain their love.

18:08.600 --> 18:09.600
I don't know.

18:09.600 --> 18:10.600
Who cares?

18:10.600 --> 18:11.600
I got nothing for that.

18:11.600 --> 18:12.600
That's dumb.

18:12.600 --> 18:13.600
That's just dumb.

18:13.600 --> 18:18.440
But that, I think, is an indication of how Alex often does, like, the Sunday shows are

18:18.440 --> 18:19.840
low stakes for him.

18:19.840 --> 18:20.840
Yeah.

18:20.840 --> 18:24.820
He knows that not many people are watching, and so he just kind of fills time a lot of

18:24.820 --> 18:25.940
the Sunday shows.

18:25.940 --> 18:30.440
So why not start off the show with a five-minute riff about why don't cops kill cats when they

18:30.440 --> 18:31.440
come to your house?

18:31.440 --> 18:32.440
I forgot.

18:32.440 --> 18:33.760
This is how he's starting the show.

18:33.760 --> 18:34.760
Right out of the gate.

18:34.760 --> 18:35.760
Right out of the gate.

18:35.760 --> 18:36.760
Right out of the gate.

18:36.760 --> 18:39.600
Look, sometimes I feel like I got to get into all of this news today.

18:39.600 --> 18:40.600
Right.

18:40.600 --> 18:42.600
He's talking about dog and cat people.

18:42.600 --> 18:43.600
Yeah.

18:43.600 --> 18:46.600
So he doesn't stay on that theme for very long, but he...

18:46.600 --> 18:50.640
Now, does he feel the same way about dog chimeras and cat chimeras?

18:50.640 --> 18:51.640
Interesting.

18:51.640 --> 18:52.640
I don't know.

18:52.640 --> 18:54.240
Do they take on the property?

18:54.240 --> 18:57.560
This is a very good, this is groundbreaking questions for Alex.

18:57.560 --> 18:58.560
Next week I'll call him to the show.

18:58.560 --> 19:03.940
Do the animals take on the properties, or do the people take on the properties of the

19:03.940 --> 19:06.000
animal that they're chimerad with?

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
I think they would have to.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
Do you?

19:08.000 --> 19:10.720
Yeah, I mean, there's got to be some sort of genetic influence from the host animal.

19:10.720 --> 19:14.360
Yeah, but the fish people have, you know, sad human eyes.

19:14.360 --> 19:16.560
You don't know that fish aren't sad all the time.

19:16.560 --> 19:17.980
That could be a...

19:17.980 --> 19:19.800
We have no idea about the psychology of fish.

19:19.800 --> 19:20.800
I don't know.

19:20.800 --> 19:21.800
They are pack animals.

19:21.800 --> 19:23.680
I don't know if fish are sad all the time.

19:23.680 --> 19:25.320
So Alex does not stay on this theme.

19:25.320 --> 19:28.120
That would be a really depressing thing.

19:28.120 --> 19:31.720
Scientists reveal that fish are all depressed all the time.

19:31.720 --> 19:33.520
They're bummed out.

19:33.520 --> 19:36.160
They like the flakes, but nothing else.

19:36.160 --> 19:38.400
So Alex doesn't stay on this theme for very long.

19:38.400 --> 19:39.400
He does...

19:39.400 --> 19:42.260
Have you seen any cops killing your fish?

19:42.260 --> 19:43.800
That's a good point.

19:43.800 --> 19:45.440
He does get weird.

19:45.440 --> 19:50.240
There's a couple of things he says on this show that I think are indefensibly weird.

19:50.240 --> 19:51.880
And I don't think...

19:51.880 --> 19:56.120
I don't think if pressed he could explain what the fuck he's talking about.

19:56.120 --> 19:58.020
And here is the first of those clips.

19:58.020 --> 20:02.040
And then they write books like Ecoscience and Bertrand Russell writes books from the

20:02.040 --> 20:05.340
30s right through the 80s and the 90s bragging about it.

20:05.340 --> 20:09.920
These people think they're gods and they say the public doesn't care.

20:09.920 --> 20:11.480
We must have the right to do it.

20:11.480 --> 20:12.480
You see...

20:12.480 --> 20:13.480
Like you say...

20:13.480 --> 20:20.320
At a spiritual, intergalactic level, at an interstellar level, there are rules just written

20:20.320 --> 20:22.220
on the universe by God.

20:22.220 --> 20:29.180
And if you don't protest something, if you don't say no to it, then you are acquiescing

20:29.180 --> 20:30.720
and accepting it.

20:30.720 --> 20:32.100
That's really weird.

20:32.100 --> 20:33.920
On an interstellar level...

20:33.920 --> 20:34.920
Intergalactically.

20:34.920 --> 20:35.920
Intergalactic level.

20:35.920 --> 20:36.920
I apologize.

20:36.920 --> 20:37.920
Both.

20:37.920 --> 20:38.920
He uses both of those words.

20:38.920 --> 20:40.720
How do we feel about McConaughey?

20:40.720 --> 20:42.560
He's great.

20:42.560 --> 20:43.760
God wrote that rule on the universe.

20:43.760 --> 20:45.320
McConaughey is pretty cool.

20:45.320 --> 20:46.320
Just keep living.

20:46.320 --> 20:47.320
Amen.

20:47.320 --> 20:48.320
That's what we do here.

20:48.320 --> 20:49.320
Yeah.

20:49.320 --> 20:50.320
That's super bizarre.

20:50.320 --> 20:55.960
He's basically expressing the belief that if you don't fight back against something,

20:55.960 --> 20:57.120
you consent to it.

20:57.120 --> 20:58.120
Yeah.

20:58.120 --> 20:59.500
And I don't disagree with him.

20:59.500 --> 21:02.560
I disagree with how he wants to direct that.

21:02.560 --> 21:09.160
But he's denying the Nuremberg, the Nuremberg defense, basically.

21:09.160 --> 21:10.360
How so?

21:10.360 --> 21:19.400
Well, the idea that I was just taking orders is not an actual defense towards you putting

21:19.400 --> 21:21.640
Jews into a concentration camp.

21:21.640 --> 21:22.640
Right.

21:22.640 --> 21:23.640
You know?

21:23.640 --> 21:25.920
So, he is right.

21:25.920 --> 21:30.560
And it's something that I've talked about, or I talked about recently, which is every

21:30.560 --> 21:38.200
day that I'm not protesting the mistreatment of black people by fucking everything, I am

21:38.200 --> 21:39.200
–

21:39.200 --> 21:40.200
The police in particular.

21:40.200 --> 21:41.200
Yeah.

21:41.200 --> 21:46.120
I am implicitly consenting to allowing this kind of worldview to exist.

21:46.120 --> 21:48.360
I think it's a little more complicated than that.

21:48.360 --> 21:50.040
Well, that's because you're a cat person.

21:50.040 --> 21:56.320
I don't think that there are universal rules and galactic rules that were written by God,

21:56.320 --> 21:57.960
especially in the way that he's presenting it.

21:57.960 --> 22:02.240
Because what he's saying is that these globalists, like Bertrand Russell and the eco-science

22:02.240 --> 22:03.240
he references –

22:03.240 --> 22:05.920
Yeah, I like how he's really bringing up the recent references.

22:05.920 --> 22:08.560
You know, Bertrand Russell writing in the 30s.

22:08.560 --> 22:09.560
Right.

22:09.560 --> 22:13.900
And John P. Holdren's textbook Eco-Science, which you've discussed in the past, does

22:13.900 --> 22:17.280
not say the things that it says.

22:17.280 --> 22:19.600
He's saying that they are putting this out there.

22:19.600 --> 22:21.960
They're giving the information of what they're doing to you.

22:21.960 --> 22:24.920
And if you don't fight back, then you just accept it.

22:24.920 --> 22:28.520
And that's cockamamie because he's lying about what those things say.

22:28.520 --> 22:29.520
Yeah.

22:29.520 --> 22:32.160
Eco-Science, the textbook, doesn't say that they're putting things in the water.

22:32.160 --> 22:34.080
It doesn't say that they're trying to dumb down the population.

22:34.080 --> 22:36.140
It has nothing to do with that stuff.

22:36.140 --> 22:37.760
It's a fucking textbook.

22:37.760 --> 22:39.440
And they just – we've been over it.

22:39.440 --> 22:40.440
It doesn't matter.

22:40.440 --> 22:41.440
Yeah.

22:41.440 --> 22:42.440
Ugh, I hate him.

22:42.440 --> 22:43.440
Anyway.

22:43.440 --> 22:46.040
I'm still mad about the dog and cat thing.

22:46.040 --> 22:47.040
I'll tell you that.

22:47.040 --> 22:48.480
I couldn't even listen to that.

22:48.480 --> 22:50.440
Listen, that might have been pretty weird.

22:50.440 --> 22:55.280
Also, I'm telling you, Interstellar, the plot mechanics are not great.

22:55.280 --> 22:56.280
Okay.

22:56.280 --> 22:57.280
Great.

22:57.280 --> 22:58.280
Save it for when you're on DougLovesMovies.

22:58.280 --> 22:59.280
I'm sorry.

22:59.280 --> 23:00.280
I'm sorry.

23:00.280 --> 23:05.560
We gotta get a lot more listeners before that happens.

23:05.560 --> 23:06.560
Maybe.

23:06.560 --> 23:08.960
Next time he's at the Rosemont or whatever.

23:08.960 --> 23:09.960
There we go.

23:09.960 --> 23:11.980
Anyway, that clip was weird.

23:11.980 --> 23:14.520
But I'm telling you, this next clip is much weirder.

23:14.520 --> 23:17.240
I might have oversold how weird that clip is.

23:17.240 --> 23:21.960
I think it's fucking very weird that he believes that there's Interstellar rules.

23:21.960 --> 23:23.600
That's very weird to me.

23:23.600 --> 23:27.360
This next clip is very – I think it's undeniably weird.

23:27.360 --> 23:28.360
Okay.

23:28.360 --> 23:33.760
And they think that people lining up to get their new iPhone, that's technology.

23:33.760 --> 23:36.760
No, that's 50-year-old crap.

23:36.760 --> 23:37.760
Exactly.

23:37.760 --> 23:40.480
The true technologies, they have it.

23:40.480 --> 23:45.800
The true technologies are mind and are genetics that every scientist that's in genetic engineering

23:45.800 --> 23:48.240
understands isn't even of this world.

23:48.240 --> 23:51.560
We're made in the image of the creator that made this planet.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.080
We predate this planet.

23:53.080 --> 23:55.180
The elite all know that.

23:55.180 --> 23:59.600
They're just there dumbing the public down to not get it.

23:59.600 --> 24:03.600
We're not seeking after the elves.

24:03.600 --> 24:04.600
We are the elves.

24:04.600 --> 24:05.600
And they know that.

24:05.600 --> 24:07.200
They can't stand it.

24:07.200 --> 24:09.520
They want to keep you from that knowledge.

24:09.520 --> 24:11.060
They're aware of what we are.

24:11.060 --> 24:14.280
They want to play God while we run around watching NFL.

24:14.280 --> 24:15.920
That's what the joke is.

24:15.920 --> 24:16.920
Yes.

24:16.920 --> 24:20.040
I don't have any favorite idol.

24:20.040 --> 24:23.280
My idol is myself to tell you the truth.

24:23.280 --> 24:28.060
My idol is human ingenuity and going to the stars and fulfilling God's destiny.

24:28.060 --> 24:29.060
My idol is my dear.

24:29.060 --> 24:36.320
And that's what we need to show our children and try and reach as many people as we can.

24:36.320 --> 24:37.320
I agree with you.

24:37.320 --> 24:38.320
God bless you.

24:38.320 --> 24:39.320
I got to jump.

24:39.320 --> 24:42.840
But this is not an elite that would put stuff in vaccines to lower our IQ and put fluoride

24:42.840 --> 24:44.280
in the water to lower our IQ.

24:44.280 --> 24:47.240
An elite doesn't seek to dumb people down.

24:47.240 --> 24:48.720
Let's say the elite are some alien species.

24:48.720 --> 24:50.880
I'm not saying that, but let's just hypothetically.

24:50.880 --> 24:55.840
What type of elite alien species wants to dumb down a planet and make people a bunch

24:55.840 --> 24:56.840
of retarded idiots?

24:56.840 --> 24:58.120
I mean, you know what?

24:58.120 --> 24:59.120
You're not my God.

24:59.120 --> 25:04.080
A real God wants to build me up and give me Promethean fire.

25:04.080 --> 25:05.080
Not control me.

25:05.080 --> 25:07.080
Do you not know that goddamn reference?

25:07.080 --> 25:08.080
No, no, no.

25:08.080 --> 25:09.080
You are not God.

25:09.080 --> 25:15.680
You are fallen degenerate scum standing in the way of the true creation that dominates

25:15.680 --> 25:16.680
you.

25:16.680 --> 25:17.680
They hate humanity.

25:17.680 --> 25:18.680
They hate honor.

25:18.680 --> 25:19.680
They hate beauty.

25:19.680 --> 25:24.360
They hate creativity because we are their God.

25:24.360 --> 25:25.400
You understand that?

25:25.400 --> 25:29.120
The elite cannot stand true humanity.

25:29.120 --> 25:33.100
They will go to hell before they capture anything.

25:33.100 --> 25:34.360
They're a joke.

25:34.360 --> 25:39.000
They're only there to provide us with the stress to make us go to the next level.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.280
Let's get that straight to your heads that they are fallen.

25:42.280 --> 25:43.280
They are failed.

25:43.280 --> 25:44.720
They are scum.

25:44.720 --> 25:46.560
So let them play their games.

25:46.560 --> 25:48.460
Let them win for the season.

25:48.460 --> 25:50.040
We win for eternity.

25:50.040 --> 25:51.040
Praise Jesus Christ.

25:51.040 --> 25:54.960
I mean, you're getting so hardcore today, but I prayed last night at like 10 o'clock

25:54.960 --> 25:55.960
at night.

25:55.960 --> 25:58.440
I said, God, just let me tell the truth.

25:58.440 --> 26:01.000
I am tired of backing down to these people.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.100
I'm tired of watching them have their way with humanity.

26:04.100 --> 26:07.600
Just turn me loose and turn humanity loose.

26:07.600 --> 26:09.880
Amy in Tennessee, you're on the air.

26:09.880 --> 26:10.880
Man.

26:10.880 --> 26:11.880
Man oh man.

26:11.880 --> 26:14.720
Amy in Tennessee, you are on the air.

26:14.720 --> 26:16.040
That is smooth as silk.

26:16.040 --> 26:17.040
Wow.

26:17.040 --> 26:18.680
So what do you think about that?

26:18.680 --> 26:20.040
Humans predate the earth.

26:20.040 --> 26:21.040
Well, yeah.

26:21.040 --> 26:23.920
I think most Christians believe that, right?

26:23.920 --> 26:24.920
I don't think so.

26:24.920 --> 26:28.680
I don't think that's nowhere near any kind of Christianity, right?

26:28.680 --> 26:35.200
That's not anywhere near anything outside of like the weirdest theosophy, like the weirdest

26:35.200 --> 26:37.800
pseudo spiritualism.

26:37.800 --> 26:43.020
I mean, I guess there is a little bit on the seventh day God rested and then he went back

26:43.020 --> 26:47.080
to the negative first day and he was like, well, I might as well create humans here too.

26:47.080 --> 26:48.460
I mean, why not?

26:48.460 --> 26:53.220
It goes into a little bit of like vaguely Gnostic beliefs.

26:53.220 --> 26:58.280
There is a tiny bit of the idea of like pieces of your spirit predate humanity, that sort

26:58.280 --> 26:59.280
of thing.

26:59.280 --> 27:00.280
Little bit of Tolkien.

27:00.280 --> 27:01.280
Sure.

27:01.280 --> 27:02.280
Little bit of elves.

27:02.280 --> 27:03.280
We're not...

27:03.280 --> 27:07.200
And a little bit of internet message board Illuminati talk.

27:07.200 --> 27:09.040
That goes back to a lot of that stuff.

27:09.040 --> 27:14.880
And the idea that he presents that these globalists, all they're there for is to be a challenge

27:14.880 --> 27:17.000
for us to get to the next level.

27:17.000 --> 27:22.720
That's a fairly common belief within Christianity though, that idea that this life is a test.

27:22.720 --> 27:27.360
Right, but it also goes to the ideas that have been pitched on internet message boards

27:27.360 --> 27:29.080
about the Illuminati.

27:29.080 --> 27:36.120
So with all of the bullshit that we deal with, every time he gets into that weird religious

27:36.120 --> 27:42.080
aspect, he just has so much more of a ring of truth to him.

27:42.080 --> 27:51.160
When he's saying we're not seeking the elves, we are the elves, it feels like he believes

27:51.160 --> 27:52.160
that.

27:52.160 --> 27:53.160
Right.

27:53.160 --> 27:54.160
Like all of the...

27:54.160 --> 27:55.160
And that's speaking in parable.

27:55.160 --> 27:56.160
Yeah.

27:56.160 --> 27:59.640
And that's like, if you guys understand, you get it.

27:59.640 --> 28:00.640
You way get it.

28:00.640 --> 28:01.640
Yeah.

28:01.640 --> 28:02.760
You maybe get it too much.

28:02.760 --> 28:06.120
I wonder if he's talking about the DMT machine elves.

28:06.120 --> 28:09.680
You know when people take DMT, they often see machine elves.

28:09.680 --> 28:11.720
I don't know what that means at all.

28:11.720 --> 28:16.720
Dimethyltryptamine is a substance that you can take, it's a very powerful hallucinogen,

28:16.720 --> 28:18.180
and you can smoke it.

28:18.180 --> 28:21.480
And when you do, a lot of people...

28:21.480 --> 28:24.900
I don't know what the percentages are, and I haven't taken it myself.

28:24.900 --> 28:26.680
A lot of people report that you...

28:26.680 --> 28:30.280
Well, we started drinking wine, so I suppose the next episode we're gonna have to do DMT.

28:30.280 --> 28:31.280
I'm in.

28:31.280 --> 28:32.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:32.280 --> 28:34.120
It lasts for like ten minutes and we could never record on it.

28:34.120 --> 28:36.840
You can't move, you're just hallucinating so hard.

28:36.840 --> 28:39.080
Maybe you can move a little, who cares?

28:39.080 --> 28:45.000
But a lot of people report that they see elves working gears and machinery.

28:45.000 --> 28:49.920
And some people have speculated that behind the veil of reality, like DMT allows you to

28:49.920 --> 28:51.560
see beyond the...

28:51.560 --> 28:52.560
Pierce the veil.

28:52.560 --> 28:53.560
Yeah, yeah.

28:53.560 --> 28:57.920
They see that there are elves who are working the machinery of reality that create whatever

28:57.920 --> 28:59.840
we see in our reality.

28:59.840 --> 29:01.040
Well that's obvious, though.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.200
Where else would we get cookies?

29:03.200 --> 29:04.200
Those trees.

29:04.200 --> 29:06.320
Those trees that have elf factories.

29:06.320 --> 29:09.600
Look, let's not go any further down this road.

29:09.600 --> 29:13.240
Let's try and stay on topic.

29:13.240 --> 29:14.240
We're still in the sixth.

29:14.240 --> 29:17.800
You've already established that we're doing an eight and a half hour long episode.

29:17.800 --> 29:19.800
Never drinking wine on the show ever again.

29:19.800 --> 29:22.640
This is already off the rails.

29:22.640 --> 29:27.200
So on the sixth, Alex Jones does a lot of that weird stuff.

29:27.200 --> 29:34.080
And then in addition to that, we start to see this creeping pro-Russia stance.

29:34.080 --> 29:36.000
Oh, we're starting to see it now.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.080
Well no, we've already seen the beginnings of it starting to develop.

29:39.080 --> 29:40.080
Right, right, right.

29:40.080 --> 29:42.960
No, but that was more like pro-strong man.

29:42.960 --> 29:44.240
Russia is male.

29:44.240 --> 29:45.240
Pro-a-man-taking-bah.

29:45.240 --> 29:46.240
Yeah.

29:46.240 --> 29:48.080
That whole thing.

29:48.080 --> 29:49.920
We're starting to see a little bit more of it.

29:49.920 --> 29:53.160
And here's what he has to say about Russia and Assad.

29:53.160 --> 29:59.360
And then we see the shocking images of a drowned Syrian boy show tragic plight of refugees.

29:59.360 --> 30:05.400
Our government five years ago launches Al-Qaeda in Syria, kills 300,000 of these innocent

30:05.400 --> 30:06.400
people.

30:06.400 --> 30:10.160
And then when Russia and Syria fight back, we call them terrorists.

30:10.160 --> 30:14.360
And our own media says that quote, take out Assad, that'll stop ISIS when that's the group

30:14.360 --> 30:15.360
attacking.

30:15.360 --> 30:19.880
And they show a dead little two year old toddler in the sand, but they won't show them.

30:19.880 --> 30:20.880
Fuck you.

30:20.880 --> 30:23.440
Tens of thousands of dead babies that I've seen online.

30:23.440 --> 30:24.440
Fuck you.

30:24.440 --> 30:28.520
And you've seen online that were killed by Western backed rebels in Syria.

30:28.520 --> 30:32.760
So they create the crisis and then say, look, a dead baby.

30:32.760 --> 30:34.760
Yeah, look.

30:34.760 --> 30:39.400
So that's crazy.

30:39.400 --> 30:40.400
Compare that.

30:40.400 --> 30:48.600
Compare that bullshit fake empathy with when somebody, like when a terrorist attack happens

30:48.600 --> 30:54.560
and he revels in all of the people who died saying, look at how right I am.

30:54.560 --> 30:58.520
And then he pretends to give a fuck about that.

30:58.520 --> 31:06.600
Uh, no, no, he doesn't get to own both empathy and, and complete sociopathy.

31:06.600 --> 31:07.600
That doesn't count.

31:07.600 --> 31:08.600
Fair.

31:08.600 --> 31:09.600
That's a fake voice.

31:09.600 --> 31:10.600
Oh yeah.

31:10.600 --> 31:11.600
That's a fake bullshit.

31:11.600 --> 31:12.600
Oh yeah.

31:12.600 --> 31:13.600
No, I'm not cool with that.

31:13.600 --> 31:16.620
Well, are you cool with the fact that he's saying that basically Russia and Assad are

31:16.620 --> 31:17.620
the good guys?

31:17.620 --> 31:18.620
Well, of course.

31:18.620 --> 31:19.620
Okay.

31:19.620 --> 31:23.840
Well, actually, you know, uh, that was the sixth and then on the seventh is labor day.

31:23.840 --> 31:25.760
So he doesn't have a show on labor day.

31:25.760 --> 31:27.080
They just do a rerun show.

31:27.080 --> 31:28.080
Uh huh.

31:28.080 --> 31:30.400
Uh, and so, you know, no need to dwell on that.

31:30.400 --> 31:32.760
I'm glad he supports union holidays.

31:32.760 --> 31:36.960
Well, I think he actually, I'm sure that he loves the free market and prosperity so much

31:36.960 --> 31:41.720
that he has to be like, well, thank God we have a day to celebrate union.

31:41.720 --> 31:44.160
He does actually make a little bit of a point of that.

31:44.160 --> 31:45.160
Oh really?

31:45.160 --> 31:46.160
Yeah.

31:46.160 --> 31:49.120
I got to celebrate this union holiday, got to give my people a day off.

31:49.120 --> 31:53.240
Anyway, uh, we come back on the eighth and uh, guess what?

31:53.240 --> 31:58.920
He's still on his bullshit about Russia being the good guys, but as you can see, I'm particularly

31:58.920 --> 32:04.440
crazed today because this is the reality of what's happening.

32:04.440 --> 32:09.040
And then I look at all the other news, all the other things that are happening.

32:09.040 --> 32:13.840
U S demands Greece close airspace to Russian humanitarian aid for Syria when they're only

32:13.840 --> 32:18.680
flying them in food and Russia is doing us a favor trying to keep all the refugees from

32:18.680 --> 32:19.680
coming here.

32:19.680 --> 32:25.320
See, I mean, that's not to, that's not to say that that in and of itself is an evil

32:25.320 --> 32:26.320
thing to say.

32:26.320 --> 32:32.200
It's not wrong to say that Syria does or Russia does some good things, some bad things, but

32:32.200 --> 32:38.840
we're seeing a pattern developing over the course of early September of just outright

32:38.840 --> 32:41.840
Russia's the good guys, we're the bad guys.

32:41.840 --> 32:43.680
And it's really bizarre.

32:43.680 --> 32:48.200
It's really bizarre considering Alex Jones has passed, he has, but as we've discussed,

32:48.200 --> 32:52.200
he played into so much Russophobia in his early career.

32:52.200 --> 32:56.240
And the last time Russia did us a favor was in world war two.

32:56.240 --> 32:58.400
That's that was the very last time.

32:58.400 --> 32:59.400
Yeah.

32:59.400 --> 33:00.400
Yeah.

33:00.400 --> 33:01.400
So I don't know.

33:01.400 --> 33:02.400
I don't know what to make of it.

33:02.400 --> 33:07.600
It is really interesting that, uh, if we look at the timeline of the world, it seems like

33:07.600 --> 33:12.800
summer fall of 2005 is when something 2015.

33:12.800 --> 33:13.800
Yeah.

33:13.800 --> 33:14.800
Excuse me.

33:14.800 --> 33:15.800
Yeah.

33:15.800 --> 33:16.800
2015 is when something really fucked up happened.

33:16.800 --> 33:17.800
Yeah.

33:17.800 --> 33:21.560
I think that that might be the branching point when our world could have gone one way or

33:21.560 --> 33:23.560
the other and we went the wrong way.

33:23.560 --> 33:25.240
That's our dark timeline.

33:25.240 --> 33:31.760
It just so happens that that's when, uh, Alex Jones is starting to warm to Trump, happens

33:31.760 --> 33:36.440
to be saying tons of positive shit about Russia and Assad on his show.

33:36.440 --> 33:37.440
I don't know.

33:37.440 --> 33:40.680
I don't have a conclusion, but it's weird.

33:40.680 --> 33:49.200
The thing that I think about pretty consistently is what's the balance between Putin taking

33:49.200 --> 33:54.340
advantage of a situation and Putin instigating the situation, right?

33:54.340 --> 34:01.040
So all of these guys right now in 2015 are just starting to be like, well, look at this

34:01.040 --> 34:03.680
strong man doing shit right now.

34:03.680 --> 34:10.640
How much of that is Russian propaganda seeping out and then Putin gone or you know, if not

34:10.640 --> 34:16.680
Putin himself directly, but his, his circle of oligarchs, um, saying this is something

34:16.680 --> 34:24.060
we can take advantage of and how much is directly his like, look at what I did like that kind

34:24.060 --> 34:25.060
of a shit.

34:25.060 --> 34:31.880
I think as it relates to Alex, it's, he's taking in like RT and Sputnik and he's getting

34:31.880 --> 34:36.040
the Russian line as the truth because it's more appealing to him.

34:36.040 --> 34:40.800
He has this idea that it's a masculine culture and that they've kicked out the globalists

34:40.800 --> 34:45.040
and therefore their media is obviously much more reliable than ours.

34:45.040 --> 34:50.680
Ours is just full of propagandists and CIA plants that are in the media.

34:50.680 --> 34:57.240
And so he just has no reason to doubt things that come from their, their outlets.

34:57.240 --> 35:00.760
It's mind boggling to try and see through these people's eyes.

35:00.760 --> 35:01.760
It's very weird.

35:01.760 --> 35:10.320
It seems it's, it could not be more obvious that RT is a state controlled media outlet

35:10.320 --> 35:14.720
even more so only shows what the state wants you to see.

35:14.720 --> 35:15.720
Yeah.

35:15.720 --> 35:17.680
Like it can't be more obvious.

35:17.680 --> 35:20.120
So how can you not catch it?

35:20.120 --> 35:21.680
I don't know.

35:21.680 --> 35:25.720
The way is you don't want to, well, yeah, yeah, you're, you're absolutely right.

35:25.720 --> 35:31.640
It doesn't fit with what you, I, I, I mean, I do understand though, because if you've

35:31.640 --> 35:39.840
built your entire life, like if you're Alex Jones at, in 2015 he's 40 ish, maybe, maybe

35:39.840 --> 35:40.840
a hundred.

35:40.840 --> 35:41.840
Who knows?

35:41.840 --> 35:42.840
He's timeless.

35:42.840 --> 35:46.720
His soul has migrated and he's talking with his ancestors and blah, blah, blah.

35:46.720 --> 35:52.660
So you've built your entire life around this ethos and just like you said, we have this,

35:52.660 --> 35:59.160
we have this splitting point, dark timeline versus the light timeline, wherein either

35:59.160 --> 36:04.760
all of these people really confront themselves and say, what I've believed for the longest

36:04.760 --> 36:09.080
length of time is wrong or they doubled down.

36:09.080 --> 36:10.080
They doubled down.

36:10.080 --> 36:11.080
And of course they doubled down.

36:11.080 --> 36:13.240
Well, at least in the case of Alex, certainly.

36:13.240 --> 36:17.640
I don't, I can't speak to whatever is happening with political figures and shit like that,

36:17.640 --> 36:20.440
but in terms of Alex, yeah, he's like, oh.

36:20.440 --> 36:29.200
I would actually say that the, the entire politics of 2015 was the, the firm cementing of there

36:29.200 --> 36:32.000
will never be a shared reality again.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.080
Oh, totally.

36:33.080 --> 36:37.400
Like it started, it started when Fox News started.

36:37.400 --> 36:38.400
Fuck off man.

36:38.400 --> 36:41.040
It started like Reagan, probably.

36:41.040 --> 36:42.040
You know what?

36:42.040 --> 36:43.040
You're absolutely right.

36:43.040 --> 36:44.360
I don't know if it was even before that.

36:44.360 --> 36:49.120
That was when the billionaire campaign of lobbying really took off.

36:49.120 --> 36:50.120
Yeah.

36:50.120 --> 36:55.080
But, but that I feel like is whenever it's like, this is how it's going to be forever.

36:55.080 --> 36:56.080
Yeah.

36:56.080 --> 36:59.800
I, I agree that it's where things ramped up to a, to a horrifying extent.

36:59.800 --> 37:00.800
Yeah.

37:00.800 --> 37:06.040
I think it's because, uh, people realized that, uh, election was coming up and they

37:06.040 --> 37:09.440
realized that, uh, it was win or lose at that point.

37:09.440 --> 37:10.440
Yeah.

37:10.440 --> 37:14.120
And the trends in society that we could see were like, well, if something doesn't happen,

37:14.120 --> 37:17.120
Democrats are never going to lose another election because that's just the way society

37:17.120 --> 37:18.120
is going.

37:18.120 --> 37:19.120
Yeah.

37:19.120 --> 37:20.560
People are becoming more progressive.

37:20.560 --> 37:22.960
People are becoming more accepting, more opening.

37:22.960 --> 37:28.760
Uh, and that is what the Democratic party largely represents, especially over the Republican

37:28.760 --> 37:29.760
party.

37:29.760 --> 37:35.320
And unless a third of viable party were to exist, uh, there doesn't seem like there's

37:35.320 --> 37:37.040
any shot there.

37:37.040 --> 37:42.760
And the GOP really embraced it because they were the ones who realized that the only way

37:42.760 --> 37:47.920
we win elections is to lean into being the white supremacist party.

37:47.920 --> 37:55.680
Because if you look at that, uh, the, uh, GOP autopsy that they did on the 2012 election,

37:55.680 --> 37:58.880
it was all about, we need to return back to the big tent.

37:58.880 --> 38:00.220
We need to expand.

38:00.220 --> 38:03.440
We need to, uh, find more Latino voters.

38:03.440 --> 38:05.320
We need to do all of this stuff.

38:05.320 --> 38:09.800
And they took none of that advice and didn't need to and didn't need to because they gerrymandered

38:09.800 --> 38:10.800
the hell out of it.

38:10.800 --> 38:11.800
Exactly.

38:11.800 --> 38:12.800
And purged voter rolls, blah, blah, blah.

38:12.800 --> 38:15.800
They went straight to white supremacy.

38:15.800 --> 38:16.800
Yeah.

38:16.800 --> 38:17.800
And, uh, God bless him.

38:17.800 --> 38:18.800
I don't know.

38:18.800 --> 38:19.800
I don't know.

38:19.800 --> 38:20.800
No.

38:20.800 --> 38:23.680
God bless him because they give us something to fight back against.

38:23.680 --> 38:26.320
They are the Illuminati of how we grow.

38:26.320 --> 38:27.320
That's how we grow as people.

38:27.320 --> 38:32.200
So on the eighth, Alex Jones has a long interview that in genetic memory.

38:32.200 --> 38:33.200
That's also how it grows.

38:33.200 --> 38:38.520
How you learn, uh, Anthony Gucci already comes in for a really long interview about how great

38:38.520 --> 38:41.900
their products are and about how terrible immigrants are.

38:41.900 --> 38:45.980
There's they're trying to, they're, they're, they're hitting both at the same time.

38:45.980 --> 38:50.480
They're trying to scare people about the immigrant waves that are going to come while simultaneously,

38:50.480 --> 38:52.820
you know, being like, all our products are fucking awesome.

38:52.820 --> 38:57.120
They're spending way more time on the show trying to sell stuff like, uh, you know, we

38:57.120 --> 39:02.280
have these periodic visits from Dr. Group who comes in for like these hour long sessions

39:02.280 --> 39:06.680
and now we're seeing like Anthony Gucci already is on almost every day doing something to

39:06.680 --> 39:08.480
try and sell product.

39:08.480 --> 39:11.880
And that is not, uh, that is not unremarkable.

39:11.880 --> 39:13.920
It's part of the lead up to the money bomb.

39:13.920 --> 39:14.920
Money bomb.

39:14.920 --> 39:15.920
Yeah.

39:15.920 --> 39:19.360
In some world we exist in, it's going to ramp up and ramp up hard.

39:19.360 --> 39:20.360
Yeah.

39:20.360 --> 39:26.000
So the, uh, after that, Alex Jones has an interview with John McAfee who created McAfee

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
McAfee.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
The McAfee.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
Yes.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.880
The guy who infects every windows computer with junkware.

39:31.880 --> 39:32.880
Uh, that'd be him.

39:32.880 --> 39:36.480
Uh, he's also the guy who may or may not have murdered his neighbor in South America.

39:36.480 --> 39:37.480
Wait, what?

39:37.480 --> 39:39.120
I don't know if this is the case.

39:39.120 --> 39:45.880
His neighbor wound up dead and he fled, uh, he was living down South, uh, the border.

39:45.880 --> 39:52.680
And, uh, his neighbor ended up dead and he was being pursued by the police for questioning.

39:52.680 --> 39:54.320
I don't, I don't know if he did it.

39:54.320 --> 39:58.960
I don't, I have no idea, but I do know that he fled and then his house burned down.

39:58.960 --> 39:59.960
I don't know.

39:59.960 --> 40:01.360
Wait, and then his house burned down?

40:01.360 --> 40:03.080
As I understand the timeline, yes.

40:03.080 --> 40:09.280
I admit I haven't done a ton of research into it, but McAfee is a wild dude.

40:09.280 --> 40:10.320
He's a wild dude.

40:10.320 --> 40:12.120
McAfee did that shit.

40:12.120 --> 40:13.960
I'm not ready to say that.

40:13.960 --> 40:14.960
That's on you, man.

40:14.960 --> 40:15.960
That's on you.

40:15.960 --> 40:19.840
McAfee is the O.J. of, uh, computer software.

40:19.840 --> 40:20.840
And weird goatees.

40:20.840 --> 40:21.840
Never seen his face.

40:21.840 --> 40:23.840
Uh, he has a weird goatee.

40:23.840 --> 40:24.840
Good for him.

40:24.840 --> 40:30.020
So McAfee is on and Alex is trying to get the exclusive out of him that he's running

40:30.020 --> 40:31.020
for president.

40:31.020 --> 40:32.020
John McAfee.

40:32.020 --> 40:37.300
And Alex is super excited about it because McAfee has a deep libertarian past and what

40:37.300 --> 40:38.300
have you.

40:38.300 --> 40:39.300
Right.

40:39.300 --> 40:40.300
And anybody who-

40:40.300 --> 40:41.300
Like a lot of those software giants too.

40:41.300 --> 40:42.300
Sure.

40:42.300 --> 40:46.800
All of those guys have a full-on, like, we're gonna build our own utopia out of Uber.

40:46.800 --> 40:47.800
Why not?

40:47.800 --> 40:50.840
If you can create a world online, why couldn't you create a world in the real world?

40:50.840 --> 40:51.840
That's a good point.

40:51.840 --> 40:55.660
So Alex is super excited about it because anyone who pays attention to Alex would make

40:55.660 --> 40:58.120
a great president, obviously.

40:58.120 --> 41:03.840
So he's trying, like, McAfee is being like, his whole storyline is, my aides, they went

41:03.840 --> 41:07.200
out and they filed paperwork for me to run for president.

41:07.200 --> 41:08.200
Yeah.

41:08.200 --> 41:09.200
I don't know if I'm gonna run for president.

41:09.200 --> 41:10.200
Yeah.

41:10.200 --> 41:12.080
And Alex is like, are you giving us the exclusive?

41:12.080 --> 41:14.520
Are you gonna announce here on Infowars that you're running for president?

41:14.520 --> 41:18.160
And he's like, I can give you the exclusive that they filed some papers.

41:18.160 --> 41:20.080
Like, fuck you, man.

41:20.080 --> 41:21.720
That's really not a great exclusive.

41:21.720 --> 41:24.800
He keeps being like, if I run, I'm gonna win.

41:24.800 --> 41:27.440
Well, then why don't you run?

41:27.440 --> 41:29.240
He didn't run and he didn't win.

41:29.240 --> 41:33.520
But in the middle of their interview, Alex Jones says this, and it really troubles me.

41:33.520 --> 41:38.840
That's why I like Ted Nugent is he's real and I know nothing against the NRA.

41:38.840 --> 41:40.840
They used to be really bad 10 years ago.

41:40.840 --> 41:42.760
Now they're really good.

41:42.760 --> 41:47.400
We've got to radicalize the liberty movement because we face a radical globalist threat.

41:47.400 --> 41:49.200
Milk toasting it won't beat it.

41:49.200 --> 41:52.820
I really am scared of that mentality because all of his...

41:52.820 --> 41:54.120
That's exactly what he did.

41:54.120 --> 41:57.800
Because all of his stuff is based on lies and fear.

41:57.800 --> 41:59.400
It's not based on reality.

41:59.400 --> 42:04.240
So he perceives an extreme enemy that he's up against, and therefore it's okay for him

42:04.240 --> 42:09.000
to radicalize his base, which is essentially what terrorists do.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.800
Yeah, that's exactly what terrorists do.

42:10.800 --> 42:20.600
I mean, the thing is ISIS has a better argument than he does for radicalizing their base.

42:20.600 --> 42:26.000
With stopping short of advocating anything ISIS does, looking at it purely just on a

42:26.000 --> 42:29.580
logic basis, their argument does make more sense.

42:29.580 --> 42:34.440
They're fighting a real enemy.

42:34.440 --> 42:39.160
Their desired goals are terrible, and those don't make sense, but the idea of fighting

42:39.160 --> 42:40.600
back certainly does.

42:40.600 --> 42:41.600
Oh, of course.

42:41.600 --> 42:42.840
Especially in their situation.

42:42.840 --> 42:44.880
And the idea of extreme measures.

42:44.880 --> 42:52.440
Imagine if we had a terrorist group that was fighting against an imaginary enemy.

42:52.440 --> 42:55.600
Without explosives, we do.

42:55.600 --> 42:56.600
We do.

42:56.600 --> 42:57.600
We absolutely do.

42:57.600 --> 42:58.600
It's the liberty movement.

42:58.600 --> 42:59.600
Yeah.

42:59.600 --> 43:02.200
That was radicalized partly by Alex Jones.

43:02.200 --> 43:03.200
Partly.

43:03.200 --> 43:06.040
I mean, he's the most mainstream voice of the people who radicalize them.

43:06.040 --> 43:08.800
Behind the scenes there are tons of those websites and shit.

43:08.800 --> 43:13.860
Like there's a whole Byzantine network of monsters out there, but yeah, he does.

43:13.860 --> 43:16.920
He's responsible for a lot of terrible shit.

43:16.920 --> 43:20.720
In the end of this episode we get a phone call from Old Man House Phone.

43:20.720 --> 43:23.640
He calls back in.

43:23.640 --> 43:25.480
I love me some Old Man House Phone.

43:25.480 --> 43:29.600
I did not pull a clip from it because it's boring, but he wants to talk to John McAfee

43:29.600 --> 43:31.320
about guns.

43:31.320 --> 43:32.880
That's fun.

43:32.880 --> 43:35.280
It's just important to point out whenever House Phone calls in.

43:35.280 --> 43:40.760
So, we move on to the tenth.

43:40.760 --> 43:41.760
Hold on.

43:41.760 --> 43:42.760
Let me back up real quick.

43:42.760 --> 43:45.120
I'm sorry, the ninth.

43:45.120 --> 43:47.440
I think I've forgotten.

43:47.440 --> 43:48.800
Has Rappaport showed up?

43:48.800 --> 43:49.800
No.

43:49.800 --> 43:50.800
John Rappaport is not in the mix.

43:50.800 --> 43:51.800
Rappaport is still not in the mix.

43:51.800 --> 43:52.800
Not in the mix.

43:52.800 --> 43:55.720
And I'll tell you, to the end of this, past the money bomb, still not there.

43:55.720 --> 43:56.720
Still not in the mix.

43:56.720 --> 43:57.720
No.

43:57.720 --> 44:00.280
Let's move on, Jordan, to September ninth.

44:00.280 --> 44:05.840
On this show, Alex Jones is very obsessed with a story out of Pittsburgh, where a gentleman,

44:05.840 --> 44:11.440
he runs a barber shop, and he got fined $750 for refusing to cut the hair of a lady who

44:11.440 --> 44:14.840
came in, because it's a dude's barber shop.

44:14.840 --> 44:17.760
Alex is furious about this.

44:17.760 --> 44:21.920
Like barber shop, like the movie barber shop, or barber shop like a white dude in a small

44:21.920 --> 44:22.920
town?

44:22.920 --> 44:23.920
Second one.

44:23.920 --> 44:24.920
There we go.

44:24.920 --> 44:27.800
I was going to say, I doubt the first one showing up on Infowars.

44:27.800 --> 44:28.800
No.

44:28.800 --> 44:34.200
He went in to the shop and they said, we are not going to get, you can't get him in here.

44:34.200 --> 44:37.500
And so she was like, all right, I'm going to complain about this.

44:37.500 --> 44:39.480
And he got fined $750.

44:39.480 --> 44:43.960
Alex Jones presents it as, hey, these guys just don't have the technology to cut ladies

44:43.960 --> 44:44.960
hair.

44:44.960 --> 44:47.360
You know, like they don't know how to do it.

44:47.360 --> 44:49.520
And there's a reasonable point to be made there.

44:49.520 --> 44:53.480
But if you actually look into the story, you can find that this dude is basically running

44:53.480 --> 45:00.840
the man show out of a barber shop and his reason for not wanting to like serve a woman

45:00.840 --> 45:05.220
who came in was less about, I don't know how to cut your hair and it was more predicated

45:05.220 --> 45:09.160
on this is where dudes go to hang out.

45:09.160 --> 45:14.200
He ends up calling in and they have an interview on a later show where he's like, men come

45:14.200 --> 45:18.800
in here to have a beer and make jokes and fart and they can't do that if ladies are

45:18.800 --> 45:19.800
in here.

45:19.800 --> 45:21.040
I'm like, you should have gotten fined.

45:21.040 --> 45:22.040
Yeah.

45:22.040 --> 45:23.160
Don't call yourself a business then.

45:23.160 --> 45:24.160
Call yourself a clubhouse.

45:24.160 --> 45:25.160
Like, right.

45:25.160 --> 45:26.160
What are you doing?

45:26.160 --> 45:27.160
Yeah.

45:27.160 --> 45:28.160
That mentality.

45:28.160 --> 45:29.720
Put your shit up in a tree, you idiot.

45:29.720 --> 45:30.720
What is this?

45:30.720 --> 45:31.720
The little rascals?

45:31.720 --> 45:32.720
What's happening?

45:32.720 --> 45:33.720
Absolutely.

45:33.720 --> 45:36.920
But the reason that Alex Jones has a leg to stand on in terms of his complaints is that

45:36.920 --> 45:42.160
he doesn't really necessarily believe that businesses should have to serve everybody.

45:42.160 --> 45:43.160
Yeah.

45:43.160 --> 45:44.160
That's true.

45:44.160 --> 45:48.180
I believe that based on his libertarian beliefs, if pressed, he would say that a business could

45:48.180 --> 45:51.360
deny service to African Americans if they wanted to.

45:51.360 --> 45:53.080
And the free market would sort it out.

45:53.080 --> 45:54.080
Right.

45:54.080 --> 45:55.080
Exactly.

45:55.080 --> 45:58.680
Even though it has been conclusively proven for all of time that the free market would

45:58.680 --> 45:59.680
not sort it out.

45:59.680 --> 46:02.280
And the last great example of that was, of course, Chick-fil-A.

46:02.280 --> 46:03.280
Yeah.

46:03.280 --> 46:04.280
Did not work out.

46:04.280 --> 46:05.280
Yeah.

46:05.280 --> 46:06.280
Didn't do shit.

46:06.280 --> 46:10.880
But that is what is behind his sort of support of this barbershop and it's super whack if

46:10.880 --> 46:14.920
you actually look at the details, but who cares?

46:14.920 --> 46:20.160
It's more interesting to me if the guy really just doesn't know how to cut ladies' hair

46:20.160 --> 46:23.240
and that was his excuse for it.

46:23.240 --> 46:29.760
Like if his defense in court was like, dude, I never actually went to school.

46:29.760 --> 46:33.400
I don't know how to cut this lady's hair.

46:33.400 --> 46:34.960
I'm just going to fuck up her hair.

46:34.960 --> 46:35.960
Yeah.

46:35.960 --> 46:37.320
Then I'd be like, oh, yeah, fair.

46:37.320 --> 46:41.440
I mean, that's borderline reasonable.

46:41.440 --> 46:43.680
But his position is not.

46:43.680 --> 46:44.680
No.

46:44.680 --> 46:49.520
So something way more important- This is only where I cut hair of dicks.

46:49.520 --> 46:50.520
Yeah.

46:50.520 --> 46:51.520
Yeah.

46:51.520 --> 46:54.080
Something way more important happens on the September 9th show.

46:54.080 --> 46:55.080
Yeah.

46:55.080 --> 47:01.160
That day, or the day before, Donald Trump came out and said some stuff about immigrants

47:01.160 --> 47:08.000
and Alex Jones has a very strong response to it and it might not be what you expect.

47:08.000 --> 47:12.520
We're going to go out to break with Donald Trump saying we've got to accept the immigrants.

47:12.520 --> 47:18.200
He tells the truth about these Arab countries and African countries won't take them, but

47:18.200 --> 47:21.000
he says that we've got to because we have the moral high ground.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.120
The whole world's collapsing into depression.

47:23.120 --> 47:26.880
We can't take billions of people, especially if they're put on welfare.

47:26.880 --> 47:27.880
This is suicide.

47:27.880 --> 47:29.440
Let's go to the clip.

47:29.440 --> 47:32.200
Well, it's a serious problem.

47:32.200 --> 47:36.400
We haven't seen anything like it since the Second World War and it's getting worse and

47:36.400 --> 47:37.400
worse.

47:37.400 --> 47:42.200
And I was actually impressed in one way, but surprised that Merkel in Germany allowed this

47:42.200 --> 47:45.040
to happen because they're really flowing through all over Europe.

47:45.040 --> 47:51.440
And if you notice, Russia is not taking and China is not taking and the Gulf States, whether

47:51.440 --> 47:56.280
you look at Saudi Arabia or Qatar or any of them, they're taking none.

47:56.280 --> 48:00.880
But some of them are and some of them are actually being very generous.

48:00.880 --> 48:06.200
It just really, I wonder, you know, where all the really Donald being generous with

48:06.200 --> 48:12.440
the Germans that pay some of the highest taxes in Europe or the French that pay 84% on average

48:12.440 --> 48:15.480
for people to come in and get put on welfare.

48:15.480 --> 48:22.540
I mean, you read the scams that third world immigrants run all across the place, Somalis

48:22.540 --> 48:25.880
up in Minnesota, Afghans in Germany.

48:25.880 --> 48:29.280
I mean, they just don't pay the taxes.

48:29.280 --> 48:30.780
They don't they do whatever they want.

48:30.780 --> 48:34.680
They run black market operations and they get welfare.

48:34.680 --> 48:36.520
And then, oh, I want to commend Merkel.

48:36.520 --> 48:37.520
She's so generous.

48:37.520 --> 48:41.160
Hey, Trump, shut your fat mouth, you punk.

48:41.160 --> 48:42.480
I knew you'd start flip.

48:42.480 --> 48:44.000
My gut told me something.

48:44.000 --> 48:48.000
How about you give your five billion dollars to him?

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
OK.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.360
Holy shit.

48:50.360 --> 48:55.140
I'm telling you, man, he was against abortion, then he was for it, then he was against it,

48:55.140 --> 48:56.140
all the rest of it.

48:56.140 --> 48:57.400
He loves Hillary Clinton.

48:57.400 --> 48:58.400
Whoa.

48:58.400 --> 48:59.400
Wow.

48:59.400 --> 49:00.400
Is that intense?

49:00.400 --> 49:03.280
So this is this is bizarre.

49:03.280 --> 49:04.480
That is wild.

49:04.480 --> 49:05.480
Yeah.

49:05.480 --> 49:11.000
Alex Jones has taken an anti Donald Trump stance on September 9th, 2015.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.440
That's more like vitriol.

49:13.440 --> 49:14.440
That's more passion.

49:14.440 --> 49:15.440
He called him a punk.

49:15.440 --> 49:16.440
Yeah.

49:16.440 --> 49:17.440
Once you shut your fat mouth.

49:17.440 --> 49:18.440
Yeah.

49:18.440 --> 49:19.440
That's more interested.

49:19.440 --> 49:22.000
Like that's exactly what he said to Schiff.

49:22.000 --> 49:23.880
He just didn't say, fill your hand.

49:23.880 --> 49:24.880
Yeah.

49:24.880 --> 49:25.880
Goddamn cocksucker.

49:25.880 --> 49:26.880
Yeah.

49:26.880 --> 49:31.280
Well, like that is more passionate than all of the stuff he said about his mob ties.

49:31.280 --> 49:32.280
Absolutely.

49:32.280 --> 49:34.160
Like that in the past episodes we've gone over.

49:34.160 --> 49:35.480
That's super bizarre.

49:35.480 --> 49:36.480
Yeah.

49:36.480 --> 49:37.760
That I don't know what to make of that.

49:37.760 --> 49:41.080
In the moment Trump is not a white supremacist.

49:41.080 --> 49:42.080
Wow.

49:42.080 --> 49:43.080
Yeah.

49:43.080 --> 49:44.080
How?

49:44.080 --> 49:45.080
What?

49:45.080 --> 49:46.080
Mm hmm.

49:46.080 --> 49:47.080
How are we still doing?

49:47.080 --> 49:48.760
It should be over by now.

49:48.760 --> 49:49.760
Totally.

49:49.760 --> 49:50.760
What?

49:50.760 --> 49:52.080
There's so many goddamn twists and turns.

49:52.080 --> 49:53.080
Yeah.

49:53.080 --> 49:57.000
So on this show after this, he has an interview with the sheriff, the guy who's he's not the

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
sheriff.

49:58.000 --> 50:02.040
Just the sheriff like a like a Cormac McCarthy character.

50:02.040 --> 50:05.320
He has an interview with the judge whose eyes are burning fire.

50:05.320 --> 50:08.280
He has an interview with a guy who's running for sheriff in Houston.

50:08.280 --> 50:09.280
Okay.

50:09.280 --> 50:11.440
And this guy is nuts.

50:11.440 --> 50:16.840
He says that he thinks that Obama is creating racial strife in order to cancel the 2016

50:16.840 --> 50:17.840
elections.

50:17.840 --> 50:21.220
Uh, spoiler alert, he does not win the election for sheriff.

50:21.220 --> 50:22.220
Goddamn it.

50:22.220 --> 50:23.720
If, ah, oh man.

50:23.720 --> 50:25.680
If Obama had just canceled him.

50:25.680 --> 50:26.680
Mm.

50:26.680 --> 50:27.680
Mm.

50:27.680 --> 50:28.680
Man.

50:28.680 --> 50:29.680
Good stuff.

50:29.680 --> 50:30.680
Yeah.

50:30.680 --> 50:31.680
Good stuff.

50:31.680 --> 50:32.680
We'd have to deal with the militia uprising, but I think that would be easier.

50:32.680 --> 50:35.560
We'd have to get the revolution out of the way pretty quick and then just moved on.

50:35.560 --> 50:36.560
Band-aid coming on.

50:36.560 --> 50:37.560
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

50:37.560 --> 50:42.280
Uh, so after that, and he has an interview with Ted Nugent, the nudge calls in, he put

50:42.280 --> 50:45.840
up the nudge signal on the past day when he was talking to John McAfee.

50:45.840 --> 50:47.080
You heard that in the little clip there.

50:47.080 --> 50:48.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:48.080 --> 50:49.080
He's like, I was just honest.

50:49.080 --> 50:50.080
He's real.

50:50.080 --> 50:51.400
He's like, I haven't talked to the nudge in a while.

50:51.400 --> 50:56.680
So he gets nudge to call in and he talks about how his show on the sportsman channel has

50:56.680 --> 50:59.960
been canceled and it's because everybody's afraid of guns.

50:59.960 --> 51:04.040
Everybody's got the best ratings ever, and I don't think any of that's true.

51:04.040 --> 51:07.760
I think it's just a convenient way for them to play victim about the Second Amendment.

51:07.760 --> 51:08.760
Yeah.

51:08.760 --> 51:11.440
And it's very boring, so.

51:11.440 --> 51:15.200
Like it's hard for them to find an excuse to play victim about the Second Amendment.

51:15.200 --> 51:16.200
Yeah.

51:16.200 --> 51:21.840
Also, I would like to wonder, what is, why was Alex saying that ten years ago the NRA

51:21.840 --> 51:23.800
was very bad and now it's very good?

51:23.800 --> 51:26.880
Oh, because they weren't that extreme about the Second Amendment.

51:26.880 --> 51:31.760
They had gone into a period where they were sort of kowtowing to anti-gun interests and

51:31.760 --> 51:33.600
they'd be like, well, maybe you don't need semi-automatics.

51:33.600 --> 51:35.420
Maybe you're right.

51:35.420 --> 51:36.880
Maybe that is reasonable.

51:36.880 --> 51:43.480
And because of these other people, these more extreme gun groups, the NRA got molded into

51:43.480 --> 51:45.680
a more extreme organization.

51:45.680 --> 51:49.640
And Alex believes that gun people should be on the offensive.

51:49.640 --> 51:51.640
And actually, he has an interview later on.

51:51.640 --> 51:54.800
Man, hearing that sentence does not make me feel good.

51:54.800 --> 51:59.000
Gun people should be on the offensive is the problem with America.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
It's pretty scary.

52:00.000 --> 52:04.800
He later has an interview with a guy who runs a, like, Citizens for Gun Rights organization

52:04.800 --> 52:08.760
that Ted Nugent was involved with, and it's a little bit scary and they make some very

52:08.760 --> 52:09.760
false claims.

52:09.760 --> 52:11.760
But we'll deal with that a little bit down the road.

52:11.760 --> 52:16.000
So on the 9th, Alex had that thing where he called Trump a punk.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
Yeah.

52:17.000 --> 52:22.920
Then on the 10th, Trump backpedaled a little bit on his, man, maybe the immigrants, maybe

52:22.920 --> 52:23.920
we don't have to take as many.

52:23.920 --> 52:26.640
And Alex is like, wow, good, he's backpedaling.

52:26.640 --> 52:31.840
But he was just mad because he changed his mind about stuff.

52:31.840 --> 52:36.000
His pure anger was about the fact that he flip-flops on dumb positions.

52:36.000 --> 52:39.640
And he's like, I called it all along, I knew there was a reason not to trust you.

52:39.640 --> 52:43.080
And then whenever he changed his mind again, he's like, well, okay, now we're back on board.

52:43.080 --> 52:45.160
Yeah, he's backpedaling, that's good.

52:45.160 --> 52:46.160
It's very weird.

52:46.160 --> 52:47.160
Wow.

52:47.160 --> 52:48.160
It's super bizarre.

52:48.160 --> 52:49.160
That's bananas.

52:49.160 --> 52:52.860
So on this episode on the 10th, he has Mark Dice, he has a video where Mark Dice goes

52:52.860 --> 52:57.720
out to the streets and tries to get people to sign a petition to ban the sale of the

52:57.720 --> 53:00.000
Bible on Amazon.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
And it barns a noble.

53:01.000 --> 53:02.000
God damn it.

53:02.000 --> 53:03.320
Mark Dice is the worst.

53:03.320 --> 53:04.840
Yeah, but here's the thing.

53:04.840 --> 53:08.000
A lot of people sign it, but you can tell, again, it's a thing where they're like, fine,

53:08.000 --> 53:09.840
fuck, I'll just sign it, leave me alone.

53:09.840 --> 53:16.220
But then beyond that, based on free market, based on Alex Jones' sort of libertarian beliefs,

53:16.220 --> 53:18.760
you should be able to not sell the Bible.

53:18.760 --> 53:24.200
Yeah, if you can refuse service to a lady getting a haircut, you should be able to refuse

53:24.200 --> 53:25.200
selling the Bible.

53:25.200 --> 53:31.080
Yeah, I don't understand where the line between your belief in religious supremacism and libertarian,

53:31.080 --> 53:36.720
like where is the, like, what is more important to you, religious baiting or your principles,

53:36.720 --> 53:38.880
your phony ass principles?

53:38.880 --> 53:39.880
It's insane.

53:39.880 --> 53:42.800
So Mark Dice almost gets into a fight with a guy on the street.

53:42.800 --> 53:45.440
All right, now I'm in, now I'm way in.

53:45.440 --> 53:50.360
Some guy is, like, really mad at him because he's trying to ban the Bible, and, but again,

53:50.360 --> 53:54.440
it's not ban the Bible, it's just don't sell it on Amazon or at Barnes and Noble.

53:54.440 --> 53:57.440
Wait, so, so somebody got really mad at him.

53:57.440 --> 53:58.440
Yeah.

53:58.440 --> 53:59.940
Why did they leave it in the fucking clip?

53:59.940 --> 54:02.880
Because the guy gets really mad at him and he's like, no, no, no, hey, hey, look, I'm

54:02.880 --> 54:04.340
doing a hidden camera show.

54:04.340 --> 54:07.260
We're trying to point out that people are stupid for signing this, and the guy's like,

54:07.260 --> 54:09.000
I don't believe you, fuck off.

54:09.000 --> 54:12.920
And then Mark Dice chases him down and is like, no, man, no, no, no, you get it.

54:12.920 --> 54:14.900
Look, the camera's right over there.

54:14.900 --> 54:16.480
It's so desperate and sad.

54:16.480 --> 54:17.480
Wow.

54:17.480 --> 54:18.480
Yeah, it's awful.

54:18.480 --> 54:19.480
That's pathetic.

54:19.480 --> 54:20.480
Yeah, Mark Dice is the worst.

54:20.480 --> 54:21.480
That's really sad.

54:21.480 --> 54:24.080
Alex Jones tells a story about harassing a lady at the hike and bike trail because she

54:24.080 --> 54:28.600
had a bumper sticker he didn't approve of, which is nonsense.

54:28.600 --> 54:30.640
That's better than elves are we are elves.

54:30.640 --> 54:34.800
I'm just giving you a rundown of stuff because, like, we can't possibly cover everything.

54:34.800 --> 54:35.800
No, no.

54:35.800 --> 54:37.560
But man, that one was, that one was wild.

54:37.560 --> 54:38.960
It's like, I don't, I don't.

54:38.960 --> 54:41.440
We've already spent an hour and a half on two clips.

54:41.440 --> 54:45.120
I don't believe the story about harassing this lady at the hike and bike trail.

54:45.120 --> 54:49.000
I think it's made up, but even in his made up story, he's still a dick.

54:49.000 --> 54:50.880
What is he doing at the hike and bike trail?

54:50.880 --> 54:51.880
He's there all the time.

54:51.880 --> 54:52.880
What?

54:52.880 --> 54:53.880
He's taking his kids there all the time.

54:53.880 --> 54:54.880
Oh, okay.

54:54.880 --> 54:57.400
He tells stories about the hike and bike trail at least every third episode.

54:57.400 --> 54:59.000
Well, maybe he's not a terrible father.

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
Maybe.

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
Give him his kids back.

55:01.000 --> 55:04.640
When he was, he has some, he has some custody.

55:04.640 --> 55:09.240
When he was telling that story about the immigrants who were fishing and cooking the fish outside,

55:09.240 --> 55:10.240
that was at the hike and bike trail.

55:10.240 --> 55:11.240
That was at the hike and bike trail.

55:11.240 --> 55:12.240
Okay.

55:12.240 --> 55:14.960
He later gets an ear infection from, uh, from the hike and bike trail.

55:14.960 --> 55:17.400
Yeah, from the lake at the hike and bike trail.

55:17.400 --> 55:20.260
You miss his two days of work because of it.

55:20.260 --> 55:25.920
But he uses it as an opportunity to sell, uh, uh, Silver Bullet, his colloidal silver

55:25.920 --> 55:26.920
product.

55:26.920 --> 55:27.920
Oh, okay.

55:27.920 --> 55:28.920
Even though.

55:28.920 --> 55:32.640
Dude, at this point, when you say he uses it as an opportunity to sell Silver Bullet,

55:32.640 --> 55:36.920
I'm halfway like, does he think, does he think werewolves are real?

55:36.920 --> 55:37.920
He might.

55:37.920 --> 55:42.960
So we're, we're in the 10th, uh, and werewolves are the original chimera.

55:42.960 --> 55:46.200
Alex Jones has a lot of really bad stuff in the next couple of days.

55:46.200 --> 55:49.160
Uh, and here is one of those things.

55:49.160 --> 55:59.600
I tell you, you talk about a death wish, but see the, in the criminals that run Europe

55:59.600 --> 56:02.120
that have hijacked it can get away with this.

56:02.120 --> 56:03.960
They can get away with anything.

56:03.960 --> 56:11.000
So it's not just a fetish to smear garbage all over Europe.

56:11.000 --> 56:14.960
I got stacks of articles of women being pulled out of cars, rape, children being raped.

56:14.960 --> 56:21.920
They're like, well, that's part of the radical Islamic culture to rape your daughter says

56:21.920 --> 56:24.440
you see, they're kicking out of their countries.

56:24.440 --> 56:29.560
They're poorest, their most criminal, their most degenerate, their most mentally ill and

56:29.560 --> 56:34.880
a bunch of 18 year old, 20 year old troublemaker crooks and ISIS people that folks don't want

56:34.880 --> 56:36.960
their countries anymore.

56:36.960 --> 56:38.560
We have them posting on their Facebook.

56:38.560 --> 56:39.560
I'm here, I'm in Berlin.

56:39.560 --> 56:40.560
Look at me.

56:40.560 --> 56:41.560
I'm a jihadi.

56:41.560 --> 56:42.560
I fought.

56:42.560 --> 56:44.480
I caught a bunch of Christians heads off.

56:44.480 --> 56:49.120
Come hang out with me ladies and all the German women turn into trendy TV and stuff.

56:49.120 --> 56:50.120
I go, absolutely.

56:50.120 --> 56:55.000
And that's the cool thing is to get, you know, beat up by a gang banger or a, you know, have

56:55.000 --> 56:59.920
his name tattooed all over him and or the next best things to be slapped around and

56:59.920 --> 57:03.120
put in a slave pit by a radical jihadi.

57:03.120 --> 57:06.760
I mean, they got all these women, teenagers, all over the world getting on airplanes and

57:06.760 --> 57:10.760
flooding to go be in dirt shacks and raped by over a hundred men.

57:10.760 --> 57:14.760
Then of course they're begging for mommy and daddy after, but that doesn't happen.

57:14.760 --> 57:18.280
You just get taken out of the field, shot in the back of the head, but it's so liberal.

57:18.280 --> 57:19.500
Gloria Steinem loves it.

57:19.500 --> 57:20.500
And so is Rachel Maddow.

57:20.500 --> 57:25.280
Hey Rachel Maddow, why don't you go over there and hang out with your little jihadi pals

57:25.280 --> 57:30.500
that little CIA Anderson Cooper promoted in the last four years as the Arab spring run

57:30.500 --> 57:32.640
by the filthy White House.

57:32.640 --> 57:34.800
That's so close to a Dennis Miller.

57:34.800 --> 57:35.800
Like that's so close.

57:35.800 --> 57:37.560
The Arab spring is run by the White House?

57:37.560 --> 57:40.600
The Arab spring was run by the White House according to Alex, yes.

57:40.600 --> 57:41.600
Okay.

57:41.600 --> 57:45.040
And the CIA was behind it and Anderson Cooper has a past with the CIA.

57:45.040 --> 57:46.040
Yeah.

57:46.040 --> 57:50.600
And so he was not really over there overseas in his capacity as a CNN reporter.

57:50.600 --> 57:54.900
He was, I don't know, inciting the Arab spring, I guess.

57:54.900 --> 58:00.320
There are a couple stories that have come out of people like young white girls going

58:00.320 --> 58:06.240
to join ISIS in the same way that there are a couple stories that have come out of young

58:06.240 --> 58:09.120
white dudes who've gone over to join.

58:09.120 --> 58:11.560
And it generally does not end up all that well.

58:11.560 --> 58:12.560
No.

58:12.560 --> 58:15.360
There are also stories of the opposite as well.

58:15.360 --> 58:21.000
People going to join the actual Syrian resistance and fight against the Iraqi army.

58:21.000 --> 58:22.000
Or the Iraqi army.

58:22.000 --> 58:23.000
Yeah, absolutely.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.200
Or even trying to come here as refugees.

58:25.200 --> 58:26.200
Yeah.

58:26.200 --> 58:27.200
Oh, crazy.

58:27.200 --> 58:33.440
But yeah, what he does is he takes like, again, it's these kernels, it's these like one or

58:33.440 --> 58:39.120
two stories that have come out and he embellishes it to be like there's thousands of young white

58:39.120 --> 58:43.760
girls who just want to go get beat by a Muslim because that's cool.

58:43.760 --> 58:45.480
These trendy women just want it.

58:45.480 --> 58:46.480
It's so disgusting.

58:46.480 --> 58:52.720
Well, there is a Pornhub channel.

58:52.720 --> 58:55.320
I can tell you this.

58:55.320 --> 58:56.320
There's not.

58:56.320 --> 58:57.320
There is definitely not.

58:57.320 --> 58:59.640
I just wanted to make you snort.

58:59.640 --> 59:01.080
That's bad.

59:01.080 --> 59:02.400
Your impulse and his.

59:02.400 --> 59:03.400
Both bad.

59:03.400 --> 59:06.440
But it has nothing on this next clip.

59:06.440 --> 59:07.440
Oh, no.

59:07.440 --> 59:12.960
This is the first of two very severe historical misrepresentations that Alex makes that we'll

59:12.960 --> 59:14.660
discuss on today's show.

59:14.660 --> 59:16.360
And I think it's probably the worst of the two.

59:16.360 --> 59:17.640
I'll let you decide.

59:17.640 --> 59:20.200
Because Hitler was a project of the elites in this country.

59:20.200 --> 59:21.200
I'm already out.

59:21.200 --> 59:22.200
I'm already out.

59:22.200 --> 59:23.200
And they shut Hitler up.

59:23.200 --> 59:24.200
Hitler was not good, by the way.

59:24.200 --> 59:29.020
But it's beyond what they tell you.

59:29.020 --> 59:30.020
Hitler was bad.

59:30.020 --> 59:31.020
Got it.

59:31.020 --> 59:38.760
Roosevelt wouldn't take the Jews because the liberal Jewish groups in New York City said

59:38.760 --> 59:42.440
they hadn't paid a ransom to them to get out.

59:42.440 --> 59:46.440
And I've had Dr. Pachinik on who was a Jew who lost family in Europe when they fled to

59:46.440 --> 59:47.440
Cuba.

59:47.440 --> 59:55.380
They fled to Cuba on a boat right after he was born because New York City wouldn't take

59:55.380 --> 59:58.440
them because the Jews said you didn't pay up.

59:58.440 --> 01:00:01.400
Oh, is it Andy Smith that doesn't want to kill Jews?

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:03.240
I guess it is, isn't it?

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:07.680
If I was a real Nazi collaborator, then it would be okay if I was Arnold Schwarzenegger

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:10.820
that wears Nazi uniforms and says he wants to be Hitler.

01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:12.240
That's okay.

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:18.680
But if I point out that the evil corrupt people like George Soros who was involved then, the

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:25.360
people above him robbed the Jews and sucked off the Jews and told them you either pay

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:28.240
a ransom or you go to Israel.

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:30.680
And then when they said, okay, we'll go to Israel, they said still you're going to pay

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:32.320
a ransom.

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:37.520
The average ransom calculates out to $1 million today.

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:44.080
All the poor Jews or the middle class Jews that didn't have it, they got sent to be murdered.

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:49.320
And then the very Jews that helped murder them sit around and create a Holocaust narrative

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:55.040
and projected on as guilt onto the American people as the national narrative, as if we

01:00:55.040 --> 01:01:00.580
were involved in it, as if the average American that fought Hitler or whose grandfathers fought

01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:03.020
Hitler was bad.

01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:08.200
So we have to let that same Jewish mafia that helped kill the Jews with Hitler engage in

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:11.320
all these criminal activities or we're anti-Semitic?

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:17.580
I say feel your hand, Nazi-loving scum, and go straight to hell where you came from.

01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:18.800
My friends, it is official.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:21.880
We can now say that Alex Jones is a Holocaust denier.

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:22.880
Wow.

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:25.280
Or at least a Holocaust revisionist.

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.980
Un... wow.

01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:28.360
That's pretty wild stuff.

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:29.360
Unreal.

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:32.480
So if you look into it, there are a bunch, you know, like there were people who were

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:36.760
able to make bribes to get themselves out of Nazi-occupied territory.

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:40.000
Yeah, not to New York City Jews.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.640
You could get out of camps if you bribed people with a lot of money because, you know, they're

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:46.440
evil but, you know, they want some money.

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:47.840
Everybody's gotta get paid.

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:48.840
Right.

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:53.720
Alex is extrapolating that to be like, oh, it was Jewish groups who were keeping these

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:58.160
poor Jews in these camps to be killed because they didn't pay up.

01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:59.160
That's amazing.

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:02.160
Because that plays on anti-Semitic tropes.

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:03.160
Yep.

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:08.120
It plays on a kernel of truth in the sense that some people were able to buy their way

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:10.280
out and...

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:15.260
And it does play on the fact that America absolutely denied Jewish refugees.

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:16.400
You know why?

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:21.480
Because of the same fucking type of people who are denying Muslim refugees now.

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:22.480
Alex.

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:27.520
So that's why they're rewriting this goddamn history so they can't, so it's like, well,

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:28.720
it wasn't us.

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:30.760
We're the ones who aren't fucking bringing it.

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:32.520
No, that's fucking bullshit.

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:37.960
If Alex had been around in the 19 goddamn thirties, he would have screamed about how

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:42.240
Jews shouldn't be allowed in there because they're Jews because they're German.

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:43.240
They're German.

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:45.120
They're secret Nazis.

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.800
That fucking bullshit.

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:51.440
What better way to sneak Nazis into America than for them to be Jewish?

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:54.520
They play on your sympathies and then before you know it, they're here.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:58.540
They're making a little Reichs within our country.

01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:06.960
Even though the very fucking antisemitic beliefs that Hitler got, he got from intellectuals

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:09.360
here in the 1910s and 20s.

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:15.120
So this whole fucking bullshit, this whole fucking bullshit about rewriting history to

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.480
make your team...

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:23.760
Like if you're somebody now who says all lives matter, do not, do not pretend for a second

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:29.280
that during the civil rights era, you wouldn't have been like, well, I get why Martin Luther

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:33.320
King Jr. is angry, but I really don't like what he's saying.

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:38.280
I'm pulling on the neck of my shirt because the next clip that we're going to play...

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:40.080
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:41.240
God damn it, Dan.

01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:44.960
It starts with him in the middle of a rant about all lives matter.

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:45.960
No!

01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:49.600
God damn it!

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:50.600
Fucking Christ.

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:54.880
Before we get to that, I want to just tell everybody, in case you're unaware, the idea

01:03:54.880 --> 01:04:00.520
of Holocaust denial is much more complicated than just someone saying it didn't happen.

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:05.080
There's a lot of schools of thought within the Holocaust denial community.

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:08.880
There are people who believe, like, it did happen, but there weren't gas chambers.

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:11.940
Or it did happen, but they were work camps.

01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:13.240
They weren't death camps.

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:18.100
It did happen, but the reason that people died was because of malnutrition, not because

01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:22.720
of a concerted effort on the Nazi's part to kill the Jews.

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:29.040
Or there's another branch that's just like, hey, yeah, six million Jews died, but a bunch

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:31.300
of other people died, so why do we care?

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:36.920
There's all these branches, and the thing that Alex is expressing is one of the branches

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:38.720
of Holocaust denial.

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:43.000
This is incredibly disgusting sort of thing to hear from him.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:50.700
This is, again, this is the, and I'm still pissed about this after our last episode,

01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:57.580
that is exactly the same shit that people will try with the alt-right versus the alt-light.

01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:01.840
If you are minimizing the Holocaust, you are denying it.

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:03.880
That is full stop.

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:11.080
You are not pretending to be more fucking intelligent or more researched than anybody

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:12.080
else.

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:13.080
You're denying it.

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:14.080
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:15.080
Exactly.

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:21.480
You're a fucking monster equivalent to somebody saying that it didn't happen.

01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:24.440
Equivalent to somebody saying that it should have happened.

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:26.000
You're a fucking monster.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.240
Full stop.

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:33.440
I think that you sort of hit the nail on the head earlier, and the reason that he engages

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:38.280
in this sort of thing is that there is a part of him that realizes that his mentality is

01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:42.840
what was the problem in our country then.

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:43.840
And now.

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:48.280
But be that as it may, Alex Jones does have a little thought about All Lives Matter, but

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:50.720
that's not the most important part of this clip.

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:52.880
It just is where he begins.

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:57.900
He's ranting about All Lives Matter and how Democrats have to apologize for saying All

01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:00.560
Lives Matter when all lives do matter.

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:05.840
But it leads to another really weird sort of religious rant that I actually think is

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:06.840
much more interesting.

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:11.520
But the rapture is a fraud.

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:14.040
There's the battle of Armageddon.

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:15.040
Christ comes back.

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:19.440
The dead in Christ are raised.

01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:22.840
And then those living spend a thousand years with Christ here on Earth.

01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:25.080
That's what the Bible says.

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:27.440
And they've got it that there's a teleporter machine.

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:28.440
What?

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:29.440
Whatever.

01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:32.440
Let's just say God the devil isn't real.

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:34.440
For the sake of argument.

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:35.440
Where is that?

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:39.160
Where is that revelation that there's a teleporter machine?

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:40.300
I want to be clear.

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:44.360
That's not referencing something that he talked about before this clip started.

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:45.360
That's I don't.

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:47.680
It just came out that there is a teleporter machine.

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:49.440
I don't know what that's in reference to.

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:51.600
No, that's that's what he's talking about with the rapture.

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:52.600
Oh.

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:53.600
That's what he's saying.

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:55.960
He's saying that the rapture isn't what people think it is.

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:58.740
It's a fucking teleporter machine.

01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:00.120
That very well may be the case.

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:01.120
Anyway.

01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:02.120
Here we go.

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:03.120
Let's get back.

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:06.880
Let's just say God the devil isn't real for the sake of argument.

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:09.560
I'm going to fight putting fluoride in the water.

01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:12.760
I'm going to fight aborting babies and selling their body parts.

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:20.000
And I don't care if twiddly-dee and twiddly-dumb preachers get up there on television in front

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:24.800
of their crowds and follow their 501c3 and give their government script.

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:27.400
Steven, finish up your points, brother.

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:28.400
Thanks for holding.

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:29.400
Wait.

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:30.400
There's a guy on hold?

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:31.400
Yeah.

01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:34.600
I'm going to have to leave it there as a punchline just because that's great.

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:39.440
What I think is really fascinating is to look at like the preachers that he does have on

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:44.540
as opposed to the preachers he complains about because he's had this guy named Pastor David

01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:46.400
James Manning on a bunch.

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:47.880
Are you aware of that guy?

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:48.880
No.

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:55.440
David Manning is one of the craziest black nationalist homophobic pastors in the world.

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:59.520
He runs a place called At-La Ministry in New York.

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:03.760
And the most notable thing he's done recently is a couple years back, maybe a year and a

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:08.640
half ago or so, he came out and said that the gay agenda is way more pervasive than

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:09.760
we think.

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:16.480
And what they're doing is that they're putting semen in the lattes at Starbucks.

01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:17.760
That's how you get the frothy milk.

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:20.040
That's how you get the frothy milk.

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:21.880
That makes as much sense as anything else?

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:23.360
There's semen in the lattes.

01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:26.200
I'm pronouncing it like that because that's how he pronounces it and it's fun.

01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:27.200
That's the weirdest.

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:28.200
It's super fun.

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:29.200
There's semen in the lattes.

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:30.200
Yeah.

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:34.880
Because if you go into Starbucks and you get a latte, it has semen in it.

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:36.520
And then you get a taste for semen.

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:40.240
And then everyone goes, the gays like to eat semen and they have a lot of fun.

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:44.560
So you'll associate these good times that you have with lattes with semen.

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:45.640
Oh man.

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:46.640
It's wild.

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:50.640
But Alex has him on as a guest pretty regularly.

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:54.800
Not super regularly, but at least like, I've found at least ten times he's been on.

01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:57.780
At least like seven.

01:08:57.780 --> 01:08:58.780
It's wild.

01:08:58.780 --> 01:08:59.780
Alright.

01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:00.780
No.

01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:01.780
I'm moving on.

01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:02.780
I have no opinions on that.

01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:03.780
Fucking.

01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:04.780
True.

01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:05.780
Untrue.

01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:06.780
I'm fine with both.

01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:12.440
I'd like to say just like, full disclosure, I used to manage a Starbucks and there's no

01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:13.440
semen in lattes.

01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:14.440
They get...

01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:17.040
I was just waiting for you to...

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:20.520
Full disclosure, I drink a lot of semen, but just recreationally.

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:21.520
Oh, of course.

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:22.520
No sex involved.

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:25.640
I just like, I gotta get my fix.

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:31.200
You get market-produced milk and it's put into a steaming wand.

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:35.160
You have a cup and the steaming wand froths the milk.

01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:36.160
This is how I...

01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:37.160
Yeah.

01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:38.160
It's not jizz.

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:42.220
But that, like, he complains about churches all the time and yet he'll have someone like

01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:43.220
him on.

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:46.520
It's fucking bizarre, but I mean...

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:47.520
Everything.

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:48.520
Everything.

01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:49.520
Nothing makes sense.

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:50.520
Everything is bizarre right now.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.160
So like I told you, they're doing a lot of sales.

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:53.160
They're trying to boost sales.

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:54.880
Trying to get the shit out.

01:09:54.880 --> 01:10:00.480
And it's like every single day, there's something like this big Anthony Gucciardi appearance,

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:02.000
Dr. Group coming on.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.480
On the 10th, they have an even bigger thing happens.

01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:10.040
We're gonna go to our guest, Steve Wetzel, here in just a moment who I asked to come

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:11.980
on the show.

01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:14.600
I've been in talks with these folks.

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:18.480
We're gonna spend about 10 minutes on this and then get back into the news.

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:24.520
I've been in talks, well, they've been a sponsor for four years, three, four years, but I've

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:29.480
been in talks for two years to do this.

01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:31.960
And finally, we got it all done.

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:36.040
I'll be honest with you, I went out and talked to some of the other top providers and they

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:42.120
just couldn't provide something as good, as as low a cost that was as high quality.

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:44.920
Because I believe in treating people like I want to be treated.

01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:45.920
The golden rule...

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:46.920
This is fucking boring.

01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:49.000
He launches a line of survival foods.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:54.760
He has a group called My Patriot Supply and their private labeling.

01:10:54.760 --> 01:11:00.960
Like an entire line of, you know, you get buckets in your house of food.

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:08.600
So I mean, he's just really trying to expand what he has for people to buy.

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:11.080
So I mean, it does feed into this, we need to make money.

01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:13.240
We need to make money fucking fast.

01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:16.300
So you get a little bit of a markup on this new thing.

01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:19.400
It's a good new revenue stream, especially when you're fucking spending all your time

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:20.720
scaring people.

01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:22.580
So there's that.

01:11:22.580 --> 01:11:30.400
Also on this show, super fun to note, Alex Jones legit forgets what year 9-11 happened.

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:34.140
Oh, God.

01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:35.140
It's 2015.

01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:36.140
Oh, fantastic.

01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:37.140
It's 2015.

01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:40.700
He says it's the 15th anniversary coming up of 9-11.

01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:42.360
And then he's like, hold on.

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:43.360
Is that right?

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:44.360
15th anniversary.

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:45.960
He even thinks about it.

01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:46.960
He's like, that's it.

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:47.960
That's it.

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:48.960
Hold up.

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:49.960
Nah, it's 15th.

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:52.400
It's always just fun to remember when people forget 9-11.

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:54.480
Anyway, let's get on to 9-11.

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:56.720
September 11th, 2015 is the next day.

01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:01.040
Oh, that's right, we're actually doing a 9-11 episode.

01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:02.040
Forget about that.

01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:04.280
He doesn't talk about it almost at all.

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:08.920
The 9-11 episode in 2015 is very, like, it's kind of blasé.

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:09.920
Hey, let's be honest.

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:10.920
It's kind of bland.

01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:13.400
Aren't we all a little bit done with 9-11?

01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:15.520
I've moved on.

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:17.560
So here is something that he does have to say on 9-11.

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:23.760
At a certain point, you know, seeing 2,000 people die versus the half a million civilians

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:29.680
that we killed in Iraq, kind of like, you know what?

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:30.680
It evens out.

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:31.680
Sure.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:33.280
I think I'm good on 9-11.

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:35.160
I don't think we're the good guy anymore.

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:36.160
No.

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:37.160
No, no, no, no.

01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:38.160
No.

01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:40.900
Oh, on 9-11, that was the day that he has the interview with the guy with the barbershop

01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:41.900
that we talked about earlier.

01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:42.900
Yes.

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:46.600
He's having this interview and the guy is a sleazy seaman dude.

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:49.160
He just gave me a very bad vibe.

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:50.880
These dudes can't fart if ladies are around.

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:51.880
I like them to fart.

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:52.880
Wait, what?

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:54.360
That's sort of one of his arguments.

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:55.680
I have my man cave here.

01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:58.360
Dudes can't tell jokes and fart if women are around.

01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:01.880
That is legitimately, like, what his argument comes down to.

01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:02.880
All right.

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:08.640
But more importantly, Alex has something he needs you to be really afraid about on 9-11,

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:09.720
and here's that.

01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:18.080
They are going to turn the Middle East over to radical Islam, merge with communism.

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:19.280
That's not how that works at all.

01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:24.080
That's the checkmate move by the New World Order and the central banks and Saudi Arabia.

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:25.800
Do you understand that?

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:30.880
Do you have that through your head, okay?

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:34.720
And then if the states don't go along with it here in the United States, the globalists

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:38.560
are going to bomb stuff and say the patriots did it, or they're going to find reasons to

01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:42.320
indict people, like the Texas Attorney General, I know they're trying to indict the governor

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:46.080
right now, and I'm not going to get any more of that.

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:47.080
I mean, do you understand?

01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:52.280
They got feds following the governor around all the time.

01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:54.040
Don't they always have feds following the governor?

01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:57.360
Yeah, but the governor was in trouble for some insider trading stuff.

01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:13:58.360 --> 01:13:59.360
Illegal things.

01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:00.360
Yeah, yeah.

01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:01.520
Things that were illegal that he was doing.

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:02.520
Yeah.

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:03.520
Alex doesn't seem...

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:04.520
He seems to think he's being targeted.

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:05.520
Well, if he...

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:06.520
See, that's the one thing.

01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:10.760
If Alex lived in Illinois, he'd be like, well, of course they're following around.

01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:13.000
One of our governors has probably committed so many crimes.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.000
So many crimes.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:18.520
Even our best governors have committed at least most crimes.

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.320
Light crimes.

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:23.420
But those things are things you need to be afraid of.

01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:27.260
The idea that they're going to do false flags, blaming the patriots, the fact that they're

01:14:27.260 --> 01:14:30.120
going to overthrow the Middle East and merge it with communism.

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:34.760
Preemptively protecting any white nationalist crime that occurs.

01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:39.600
A lot of that is stuff you need to be afraid of, but Alex Jones has some more information

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:41.360
that you should be more afraid of immediately.

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:42.360
What's that?

01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:47.080
All the time right now trying to find him with a crooked toenail to throw him in jail.

01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:49.600
And by the way, the FBI doesn't like doing it.

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:51.640
I mean, most people in the FBI are not really bad.

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:57.000
They're compartmentalized, but it's so dirty now, they're just going, I cannot believe

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.000
we're this evil.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.640
And I'm not going to get into my sources, folks, but I mean, I have sources...

01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:02.640
Donald Trump Jr.

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:03.640
Not yet.

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:10.080
That's the problem with my job, man, is I know so much more than I can even say because

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:11.400
I can't reveal sources.

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:16.500
But the reason I know they're making their move is it's bad.

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:17.500
It's bad.

01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:19.900
They're looking at a whole bunch of governors they're going to arrest.

01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:24.480
They're looking at taking out people in legislatures, governments even looking at sending hit teams

01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:27.400
around to kill key people that aren't going to go along with this.

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:30.640
And all these generals that are now telling the truth and stuff, you know they're going

01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:32.900
to send a hit team to kill you and your family, right?

01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:36.360
People say you suicided your wife and kids, so I'm going to tell the generals and everybody

01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:37.800
else something right now.

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:43.720
You're going to preside over the destruction of America and the world sliding into a new

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:51.720
dark age and you are going to end up getting locked in prison or killed probably because

01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:53.600
of your inaction and your cowards.

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:55.640
I mean, I'm going to say it right now.

01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:56.640
Spoiler alert.

01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:57.640
None of that happened.

01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:02.080
That's a really, really great way to describe the GOP under Trump right now.

01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:03.360
How do you mean?

01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:04.360
Cowards?

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:09.280
Like you guys, because of your inaction, are going to wind up in jail and you're like,

01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:11.520
oh yeah, that's probably true.

01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:12.520
So hit team...

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:14.800
Fucking sooner or later.

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:22.360
And let's be honest, now it's entirely possible that we don't make it through this whole section

01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:23.520
of democracy.

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:24.520
Very possible.

01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:27.400
Now historically though, America's made it through shit.

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:28.400
We've done it.

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:29.400
We've done a lot.

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:30.400
Yeah, that's true.

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:35.520
And as much as they want to believe that once they enact the GOP agenda and they restrict

01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:39.720
voting rights and all of that shit, it's not like our voting rights haven't been restricted

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:40.720
before.

01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:45.920
It's not like a large, it's not like women got the vote in 1776, you know, like that

01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:46.920
kind of thing.

01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:52.880
So if they do, if they, if they don't pull it off perfectly, sooner or later we're going

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:55.560
to fucking come after them, right?

01:16:55.560 --> 01:17:03.720
So if, if the GOP doesn't win this a hundred percent, and it seems unlikely sooner or later,

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:06.320
they're going to get fucked and they don't understand that.

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:08.680
No, but we're not saying there's going to be hit teams.

01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:14.440
Uh, I mean, fucking are we, are we not, are we not saying that now you're now, are we

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:16.280
not saying that now you're turning into Alex Jones.

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:17.280
Are we not saying that?

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:21.040
I'm just saying, are we not saying you got to stop Jonesing?

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:22.040
That's our new thing.

01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:23.040
That's our new thing.

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:25.640
So to get too close to Alex Jones, stop Jonesing bro.

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:29.120
We're no longer, we're no longer doing the points we're doing stop Jonesing.

01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:30.120
Yeah.

01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:31.320
Um, so that, that's wild.

01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:32.320
That didn't happen.

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:36.240
Hit teams did not take out governors or legislators.

01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:42.200
What kind of lunacy would occur if you, I'd like to point out for all of you listening

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:45.760
who think that we're a little bit off, it's not the wine, Jordan is watching the baseball

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:46.760
game on his phone.

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:48.760
I am not doing that.

01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:49.760
Jordan has the Cubs game.

01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:53.000
I am just, I'm just keeping, I'm just being aware of it.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.880
I am just keeping awareness of it.

01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:58.760
I understand you're a fan.

01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:02.360
I, I'm far more, I'm far more angry about that.

01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:05.240
I seen you, if you had just said it was the wine.

01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:06.240
Are you sure?

01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:07.240
Are you sure?

01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:08.240
It's not because, Oh wait, we're up.

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:09.240
Nevermind.

01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:12.640
Listen, listen.

01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:16.200
So on September 11th, that was one of the things he wanted to talk about, but again,

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:17.200
it makes total sense.

01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:18.360
He wants to scare people.

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:21.520
And so the idea that he has high level sources that say they're going to take out all the

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:22.520
guys you like.

01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:23.520
Right.

01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:27.200
All of our Patriot guys, they're going to take them out secretly, um, that, that feeds

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:28.200
into that.

01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:32.040
But he also has an interview with a guy named Joseph Farah.

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:33.360
You're aware of Joseph Farah.

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:34.560
I am not.

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:35.560
Never heard of that name before.

01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:40.240
He is the guy who started World Net Daily and he is a dick.

01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:41.240
Yeah.

01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:46.520
I was going to say you, you said World Net Daily and I'm like, I bet he's a horrifying

01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:47.520
fucking person.

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:52.120
He is big into the Clinton conspiracies along with our friend Larry Nichols.

01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:53.120
Yep.

01:18:53.120 --> 01:19:00.240
Uh, and then also he, uh, is super, has made a lot of public claims that Obama, his birth

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:01.240
certificate is fake.

01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:02.240
Yeah.

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:07.160
He offered to pay up $15,000 if they could prove it was real and then reneged once the

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:08.800
birth certificate was revealed.

01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:09.800
Yeah.

01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:16.520
Uh, it, it, he's a, he's a dick, but he, uh, he released some information about the Clintons

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:22.480
that is dubious, uh, in the past about how they wanted to silence conservative voices

01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:23.480
and stuff like that.

01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:24.480
Yeah.

01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:29.000
So Alex has him on to do an interview about, you know, the growing Clinton menace in the

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
2016 election.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.920
And he asks Joseph Farah, uh, Hey, you've got a bunch of information.

01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:37.040
Why don't you release it?

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:41.520
Well, you know, you have a bunch of stuff from this Clinton stash that you have very

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:42.920
legitimate question.

01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:45.600
Now, let's see how legitimate his answer is.

01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:46.600
Okay.

01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:47.600
I agree with you.

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:51.840
In closing, I want to get you back in the next few months to get into those documents

01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:52.840
you got.

01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:55.680
You said some of it was so incendiary, you had to carefully dole it out.

01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:58.560
When are we going to learn more about what you got from the Clinton library?

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:00.720
I mean, what you released was bombshell.

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:05.000
Yeah, well, it's, there's a lot of good stuff in there, but you know, when I look at it,

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:10.920
I think this means something to me because I experienced it, you know, how much can I

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:15.400
put out there without people thinking I'm just being self-indulgent and just being this

01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:16.520
doesn't matter.

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:22.360
This is how they plan to shut down new media and how they, I mean, it's, it's really powerful.

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:27.280
They thought of shutting down new media even before we got started, Alex, that's that they

01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:29.480
saw the, I have to hand it to them.

01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:34.480
They saw what a threat, uh, you know, we were at such an early stage in the development

01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:35.480
of new media.

01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:42.880
And so now, you know, now with guys like you and Breitbart and Drudge and the rest, uh,

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:46.080
they really got their hands full and there'll be more serious than ever.

01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:49.080
Oh, that's a good dodge to Alex Jones's question.

01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:55.120
But in terms of the actual answer he gives us, I have a bunch of damning documents that

01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:59.280
I don't want to release because people think I'm just being sentimental or nostalgic.

01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:04.200
What is, no, that means self-indulgent, which I don't know what he also said, nostalgic.

01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:05.200
Okay.

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:08.040
As Alex was talking over him, he said, I don't want to look like I'm nostalgic.

01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:09.960
I don't understand what that means at all.

01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:14.720
I think if I was going to try and give him a tiny bit of credit, I would say that what

01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:19.040
he means is people will think I'm trying to self-aggrandize, I'm trying to make myself

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:21.440
the story about the Clintons.

01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:22.820
And I want to avoid that.

01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:27.140
It's him trying to be magnanimous and humble, but the reality is he has nothing.

01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:28.760
He has no information.

01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:34.040
Obviously, you're the fucking guy who runs and started World News, World Net Daily.

01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:36.860
You're on Alex Jones's show talking shit about the Clintons.

01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:40.800
If you had any concrete information, you would pony that motherfucking shit up.

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:45.440
Frankly, even if you had no concrete information, you would make something up.

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:46.440
Right.

01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:47.440
Why is he pretending?

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:48.760
Because you want to have the MacGuffin.

01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:54.660
You want to have this idea of this possible thing, this magic thing that's in a box.

01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:56.720
It's the same thing with what's on the server.

01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:58.320
It's the same thing.

01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:03.580
Whatever it creates in your mind is way more potent than what the reality is.

01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:08.760
It's the same reason, like, I've been putting out these, I made an archive of the episodes

01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:11.800
of That's What They Want You To Think, me and Marty's conspiracy theory show.

01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:12.800
Yeah.

01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:13.800
Nice plug.

01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:14.800
Thanks.

01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:16.520
We did one episode about a group called the Hellfire Club.

01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:18.160
I don't know if you're aware of them.

01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:19.160
Not at all.

01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:21.400
They're a secret society that existed way in the past.

01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:25.200
There's a guy named Sir Francis Dashwood, and I just love their names.

01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:26.200
They're great.

01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:27.200
Oh, no, no, no.

01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:29.120
Of course I know who the Hellfire Club is.

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:30.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:33.280
So they had this secret society, and most of it really was just debauchery.

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:34.280
It was fucking.

01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:38.400
It was drinking and fucking and saying things that God doesn't want you to say, and making

01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:41.040
paintings of themselves as saints.

01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:42.600
Sodomy was involved.

01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:44.540
Yeah, probably a lot of butt-fucking.

01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:50.760
But the idea that they had was they created secrecy intentionally.

01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:57.440
They had this methodology wherein they would publicly talk about how secret their society

01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:58.440
was.

01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:01.400
And because they would do that, there was a mystique to what they did.

01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:05.100
And everyone thought they were doing way more important shit than they were actually doing.

01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:06.600
They were drinking and fucking.

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:11.200
They were committing sacrilege, perhaps, but it wasn't to any larger goal.

01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:16.440
But because they would be like, ask me about the Hellfire Club.

01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:19.160
Hey, Dan, have you been to the Hellfire Club?

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:22.840
Man, I haven't, but I hear they're really up to some weird shit in there, but no one

01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:24.320
talks about what goes on there.

01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:25.320
Nobody talks about it?

01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:26.320
No.

01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:28.000
But, like, do you know?

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.000
I have no idea.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.440
I've heard some fables.

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:32.440
Fables?

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:33.440
Fables?

01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:34.440
Yeah.

01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:35.440
Did Aesop write about the Hellfire Club?

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:36.440
Moving on.

01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:37.840
That roleplay didn't work out.

01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:39.400
But you understand what I'm saying?

01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:41.360
None of our roleplays have ever worked out.

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:42.360
We've never taken improv classes.

01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:43.360
No.

01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:44.360
But you understand what I'm saying?

01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:45.360
No, absolutely.

01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:46.360
Joseph Farah's playing the same game.

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:51.320
This mystique, like, I don't want to release this stuff because your mind will be like,

01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:53.080
oh, it's got to be the most damning stuff.

01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:54.080
He's not putting it up.

01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:55.080
Maybe it's dangerous.

01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:56.080
Yeah.

01:23:56.080 --> 01:24:01.360
I think what had the best representation of that, I think, is in one of his, I think it

01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:07.680
was the long, dark tea time of the soul, he had a famous author who would famously have

01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:13.120
a bunch of chickens taken into his hotel room every night and nobody knows what they were

01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:14.120
for.

01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:15.120
Yeah.

01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:18.000
And then later on he was like, well, yeah, he just had them brought in and had them smuggled

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:22.800
out with nobody knowing because it created that sense of, what the fuck is this guy doing?

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:23.800
Like that kind of thing.

01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:26.240
How many weird celebrities play that same game today?

01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:27.240
Yeah, exactly.

01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:28.240
Yeah, absolutely.

01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:32.320
So Joseph Farah is playing the same game, but it's unfortunately way more damaging because

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:36.480
what it creates is part of that vast right wing conspiracy.

01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:37.480
Of course.

01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:40.600
That Hillary Clinton so accurately complained about.

01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:41.600
So.

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:43.600
Oh, poor Hillary.

01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:44.600
Oh, poor Hillary.

01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:46.440
Poor, well, actually poor all of us.

01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:47.440
Yeah.

01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:51.200
And let's be clear, we're not like sitting here saying that she's the greatest.

01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:52.200
No.

01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:53.200
That's not our game.

01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:54.200
Yeah.

01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:55.200
That's like us.

01:24:55.200 --> 01:25:01.960
Like, I, the thing I think about whenever we talk about the election is a lot of what's

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:06.040
going on with Emmanuel Macron right now in France.

01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:10.120
Like he's way better than, uh, once or fuck.

01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:11.120
Le Pen.

01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:12.120
Yeah.

01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:13.120
Then Le Pen.

01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:14.120
Right.

01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:15.120
But he's still acting like he's a king, you know?

01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:16.120
Yeah.

01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:17.120
Like he's not, he's not doing good.

01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:20.360
He, he sucks in a lot of ways, but Le Pen would have been so much worse.

01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:21.360
Yeah, exactly.

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:30.120
And like our, our, our, it seems like our world now exists in the extreme far right.

01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:31.120
Yeah.

01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:32.680
And then people who are center right.

01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:33.680
Neoliberalism.

01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:34.680
Yeah, exactly.

01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:35.680
Yeah.

01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:36.680
Which is.

01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:37.680
Which sucks.

01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:38.680
Like, hey, how about progressives?

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:41.680
Like I, I, this is a thing that I thought about.

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:47.680
But dude, if you think about it, that is the way that a lot of conservatives felt before

01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:53.560
the tea party really got going is that like the center was liberal and then the extra,

01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:54.560
you know what I'm saying?

01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:59.720
Like the Republicans were coming to the center and then the Democrats were straight up socialists.

01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:00.720
Yeah.

01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:06.480
And so they launched this hard right thing and they have moved it super far to the right.

01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:07.480
So far right.

01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:12.200
And maybe, I don't know, I don't know how I feel entirely about the blossoming internet

01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:15.120
socialism that's been going on lately.

01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:20.220
I need to look into it a little more before I, before I speak on it, but it's possible

01:26:20.220 --> 01:26:26.400
that that will become its own sort of a new version on the left of the tea party and swing

01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:28.060
things back.

01:26:28.060 --> 01:26:32.320
But unfortunately what will happen then is it won't readjust to the middle.

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:35.760
It will swing the other way and then there'll be an even more extreme response from the

01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:38.680
militias on the right and then eventually we'll all kill each other.

01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:42.720
There is, there is the, for every action there is an equal and opposite.

01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:43.720
Yeah.

01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:44.720
Yeah.

01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:45.720
Yeah.

01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:46.720
Which kind of sucks.

01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:49.360
Dead silence for the next 10 minutes.

01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:51.680
Let's get introspective.

01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:57.340
So speaking of things that suck, this next clip from Alex is one of the most woefully

01:26:57.340 --> 01:27:00.080
misogynistic things he's ever had to say.

01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:01.080
And that's saying a lot.

01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:02.080
Oh God.

01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:04.040
But I just illustrate how serious this is.

01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:08.400
You know, I mentioned this article, feminists claim it's sexist to complain.

01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:13.280
See, I think it's sexist for her to complain out of 40 and slip.

01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:18.080
Biologists claim it's sexist to compliment women, feminazi to use the Rush Limbaugh term

01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:19.080
publicly.

01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:22.600
Uh, just real quick, let's, let's tell the story about what happened.

01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:28.040
What there was a lady, there was a lady who on LinkedIn, uh, had a guy sent her a message,

01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:32.360
uh, that was basically like, Hey, I'd like to get in touch with you.

01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:37.360
Also, I got to say this might not be politically correct, but you've got the best picture on

01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:38.360
LinkedIn.

01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:39.360
All right.

01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:42.840
And so her response was, I come here, this is a professional networking site.

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:47.760
I do not want to be judged by my appearance, especially by someone twice my age, this whole

01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:48.760
sort of thing.

01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:51.640
And then there was a massive backlash against her.

01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:53.160
Everyone started calling her a cunt.

01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:57.580
Uh, she started getting tons of death and rape threats over social media.

01:27:57.580 --> 01:28:02.640
She was inundated with so much abuse just from standing up for herself.

01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:07.200
I don't think that I read the messages that were sent, uh, they're posted.

01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:09.160
You can read, there's a Guardian article about it.

01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:12.880
I don't think that she said anything that was like, Hey, fuck you, man.

01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:13.880
Right.

01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:14.880
It was more corrective than anything else.

01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:17.880
It's like, Hey, don't fucking, I'm a, I'm a person.

01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:20.600
This is not a place for you to try and pick me up.

01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:27.240
I've, I've had that so many times at shows where, um, afterwards if it's me and a, uh,

01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:29.640
well actually this just happened recently.

01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:33.720
Uh, Kristen Lundberg, uh, uh, comic in Chicago.

01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:38.400
Um, she and I did a show together and one of the guys on the show afterwards came up

01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:44.000
to her and was like, man, whenever you pulled out that violin, you were so sexy.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.520
There are compliments about comedy.

01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:47.520
Yeah.

01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:49.200
You don't need, what is that?

01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:50.640
It's what the fuck is that?

01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:51.640
It's very weird.

01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:58.360
And the reason that like she, you were very funny instead of fucking like, that's exactly

01:28:58.360 --> 01:28:59.360
what that is.

01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:01.640
Like, are you good at your job?

01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:04.680
But the reason that she brought it up and I think, you know, the conversation that's

01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:10.360
been had that a lot of dudes aren't listening to is that these sexualizing and eroticizing

01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:16.480
compliments, especially in non romantic contexts, what it does is it's a way of exerting power

01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:17.480
over women.

01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:18.480
Yeah.

01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:21.000
It's a way of taking away their, uh, agency and their ability.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.620
And that's the point that she was making and she's totally right.

01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:25.400
Now let's hear Alex discuss it.

01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:26.400
Oh no.

01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:27.400
Shame's man.

01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:28.400
I don't want to know.

01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:29.560
For complimenting her.

01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:31.560
I don't want to know.

01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:32.560
Stop.

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:33.560
Mic down.

01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:38.400
And now in the London Telegraph today, lawyer who accused barrister of sexism, the same

01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:41.680
woman has described men online as hot stuff.

01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:43.800
Ooh, a thought crime there.

01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:47.840
I mean, a mammal will be attracted to the opposite sex.

01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:50.040
That's not a crime.

01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:53.320
Having the name he or she or boy or girl, it's not bad to be he or she.

01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:57.520
See, I mean, this is how freakish this is getting.

01:29:57.520 --> 01:30:02.600
A lawyer who accused a fellow barrister of sexism in England after he described LinkedIn

01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:07.280
profile as stunning and previously praised men for their physical appearance online telling

01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:13.000
them they are hot stuff that she just chose to do this and the feminist groups said, good

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:18.520
name him and shaming to get her stars in bars.

01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:22.920
Charlotte proud man, 27 said she felt objectified.

01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:28.280
Oh, oh, that's why you had your hair all done up and stuff on there after receiving an online

01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:33.000
message from Alexander Carter, 57.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:40.160
She had invited to connect on the professional networking site, so she invited him to connect.

01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:41.800
He said, wow, I love your photo.

01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:43.200
It's stunning.

01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:44.200
How dare him?

01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:49.800
I mean, I'll be sitting there and there's an old lady checking me out of the Dillard's

01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:53.280
or something about a shirt and she's got a cool watch or something.

01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:54.600
I don't say it if I don't like it.

01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:57.480
I know that's a really nice watch or your hair really looks nice.

01:30:57.480 --> 01:31:04.360
I mean, does my dad does, uh, I see a guy get, you know, uh, on an elevator with me

01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:08.720
with a cool sports jacket or a cool Rolex or cool, uh, bag.

01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:09.840
I'll say, man, that's really cool.

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:10.960
I'm just being nice.

01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:13.440
Plus I like it.

01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:19.800
This is sick telling us that our very communication's bad, but it is a smaller and smaller boxes,

01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:21.720
but it's all selectively enforced.

01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:26.360
If you want to have liberal Hollywood, sexism, sex stuff, debauchery, torture, murder, and

01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:29.200
it's okay.

01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:32.240
You can have kids play violent video games all day, but if they go to school and write

01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:38.640
an essay about the Marines and mention him to 16 here come the police.

01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:43.640
He wrote, I appreciate this, that this is probably horrendously politically incorrect,

01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:45.200
but that is a stunning picture.

01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:51.240
Oh, he even admitted it was politically incorrect, even prostrated himself before that.

01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:52.680
I'm so sorry.

01:31:52.680 --> 01:32:00.320
It's politically correct, incorrect, and that's signaled her like a bug-eyed Burana to come

01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:06.840
in and go after him to see they pack members of the cult even more.

01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:14.280
I'll be, you know, what I found is these women that are fake feminist, I've talked a lot

01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:19.640
of guys about this, like democratic party, operative women and stuff actually want to

01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:24.920
be debased and want to be called pigs and stuff, and so the problem was he groveled

01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:25.920
to her.

01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:26.920
I'm not staying with her, but that's what I would imagine.

01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:27.920
He just said, hey, you pussy.

01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:33.080
It's time for us to get together right now, he's been partying that night, brother.

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:35.160
Holy shit.

01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:36.560
Holy shit.

01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:38.780
That end is crazy.

01:32:38.780 --> 01:32:45.240
If he had just fucking outright sexually harassed her as opposed to couched his sexual harassment

01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:50.380
in polite language, he would have been fucking on LinkedIn.

01:32:50.380 --> 01:32:52.720
That's so fucking awful.

01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:54.480
That interpretation is wild.

01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:57.680
I don't, how can you not understand that?

01:32:57.680 --> 01:33:03.320
How can you not understand that the context of his, look, I want to fuck.

01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:05.960
But that's not why I would hire someone.

01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:07.560
That's not why I would be on LinkedIn.

01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:08.560
Yeah.

01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:13.620
What's wrong with you if you're like, hey, look at this sexy attractive woman.

01:33:13.620 --> 01:33:18.520
That's great, so long as you're not being a creep, so long as you're not pulling them

01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:23.120
off the street, so long as you're catcalling, so long as it's within the context that makes

01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:28.160
sense and is accepted by both sides.

01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:34.720
But the idea that you should do that in a professional circumstance is so, it's bizarre.

01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:39.960
So, also, but the reason that he thinks he's in sort of safe harbor to critique her and

01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:45.920
call her like a wild, out of control, feminazi, blah, blah, blah, is that he said at the beginning

01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:49.200
of that that she'd called men sexy and hot stuff online.

01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:54.200
Yeah, like that's exactly fucking, fucking, fuck, come on.

01:33:54.200 --> 01:34:00.760
If you look into that, the circumstances are she commented sexy on her friend's photos

01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:01.760
on Facebook.

01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:02.760
No fucking.

01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:04.480
Which is completely different.

01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:05.480
Very, very different.

01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:06.480
It's so stupid.

01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:07.480
That's congratulatory.

01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:12.160
He knows, he knows that people aren't going to look into it.

01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:18.400
He knows that his audience is already predisposed to these anti-feminist, chauvinist mentalities

01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:21.320
because he knows that his fucking audience is all dudes.

01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:27.240
But that's like, that's just like whenever they show the, or the little headlines, stuff

01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:37.600
like that, where it's like, oh, a former convict murdered by the cops instead of father of

01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:38.600
two.

01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:39.600
No, it's even worse.

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:42.120
But when it's a white person, it's father of three.

01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:46.720
There were two examples within the last week that were really illustrative of that.

01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:47.720
Oh yeah.

01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:52.480
There was the one where a guy pulled someone out of a burning car and they said ex-felon

01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:57.200
saved, instead of going to a job interview, saved someone from a burning car.

01:34:57.200 --> 01:34:59.760
Why the fuck do you have to bring up that he's a fucking felon in the headline?

01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:00.760
No.

01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:06.080
And then the other one was that there was a lady who sent ricin to President Obama and

01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:07.440
they used her headshot.

01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:08.440
Former actress.

01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:09.440
Right.

01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:10.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:11.440
So.

01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:14.240
Fucking unbelievable.

01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:20.240
Or just, just the way that the white lady shot, the Australian white lady shot by the

01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:22.440
cops is treated so differently.

01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:23.440
And the chief of police.

01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:24.440
The police chief resigned.

01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:26.720
She didn't get fired.

01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:27.720
She resigned.

01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:28.720
Yeah.

01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:29.720
Over it.

01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:30.720
Un-fucking-believable.

01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:36.720
It's all, it's like if it weren't so tragic and, you know, a sign of what our society's

01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:38.300
up to, it would be comical.

01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:41.360
Like the actual elements of it are farce.

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:45.920
But be that as it may, that's kind of where we leave off September 11th, 2015.

01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:47.920
Not a whole lot of talk about September 11th.

01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:48.920
Never forget.

01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:49.920
Really.

01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:52.120
He has an interview with our favorite homophobic pastor, Chuck Baldwin.

01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:57.080
He is the guy who said that no civilization that has officially endorsed homosexuality

01:35:57.080 --> 01:35:58.080
has ever survived.

01:35:58.080 --> 01:35:59.080
Oh, that's true.

01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:03.240
He goes on to say a bunch more homophobic stuff, and they scream about how Christianity

01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:08.720
is responsible for saving people from slavery, all sorts of, you know, everything that's

01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:09.920
good that's ever happened is Christianity.

01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:12.440
Everything that's good that's ever happened is Christian.

01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:15.640
Even when Christians did bad stuff, well, that's because they weren't Christians.

01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:16.640
Yeah.

01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:17.640
So.

01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:18.640
They were doing bad stuff.

01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:19.640
So that was on the 11th, and then.

01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:23.800
It's as if, regardless of your religion, people are capable of doing good and bad.

01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:24.800
Yeah.

01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:25.800
So the 11th is a Friday.

01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:30.160
Then, over the weekend, Alex Jones goes to the hike and bike trail and jumps into the

01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:32.040
lake and ends up with an ear infection.

01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:35.700
So he's gone on Sunday, David Knight hosts on the 13th.

01:36:35.700 --> 01:36:37.760
David Knight hosts again on the 14th.

01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:40.920
So he can skip past those, and we get back to the 15th.

01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:44.320
And it's weird, because he ended the 11th show talking about how Christianity has done

01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:46.640
everything great for civilization.

01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:52.380
And he comes back on the 15th, and he wants to talk a whole bunch about West.

01:36:52.380 --> 01:36:53.380
The West.

01:36:53.380 --> 01:36:54.640
God damn it.

01:36:54.640 --> 01:37:01.040
And it's very similar stuff, but instead of religion, it's based in the West.

01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:05.400
And I would posit, he does not have a good handle on history.

01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:06.960
But we can discuss that on the 11th.

01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:09.260
Oh, oh, did we just discover that now?

01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:11.280
We can discuss that on the other end of this book.

01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:15.640
All I've been taught my whole life was how evil the West was.

01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:18.080
How inherently bad white people were.

01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:30.560
And then I studied history from even foreign perspectives, and it's just not true.

01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:37.320
And why the West is great, and why I say it's the best, on average, some cultures are better

01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:43.160
than other things for whatever manifestation, whatever manifest destiny reason.

01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:46.680
Just like different breeds of dogs behave differently and have different attributes.

01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:51.000
White dogs are better.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:55.760
The West has been the great innovator.

01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:58.920
The great builders, the great scientists.

01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:07.040
Now much of the ideas of the West has come from the East, come from the South, come from

01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:09.240
even older cultures.

01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:15.760
But for whatever reason, many of those cultures fell before and never rose back up.

01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:22.520
And the West, the Romans particularly, were great innovators at grabbing other cultures

01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:23.920
and using it.

01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:30.120
When other cultures tended to not innovate, they intended to invent things, but then not

01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:31.880
innovate off of that.

01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:33.240
I don't know what that means.

01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:34.240
On average.

01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:35.240
I do.

01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:37.960
And so it was the West that was the melting pot.

01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:47.160
It was the West, early on, that actually wasn't racist and sectarian like some of the other

01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:48.160
groups.

01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:50.360
Now the West became like that later.

01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:51.360
Sure.

01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:57.720
So I have a lot of historical thoughts, but first is...

01:38:57.720 --> 01:38:59.600
Where do we start with his bullshit there?

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:02.280
I'll try and work backwards.

01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:05.240
I want to start at the beginning, all right?

01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:07.840
Go ahead.

01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:08.840
The idea that...

01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:11.120
First there was God.

01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:12.120
The idea that...

01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:13.520
Then he created the stars and the...

01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:14.520
Okay.

01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:18.440
The idea that old-time West civilizations weren't racist is patently absurd.

01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:22.600
I haven't studied Rome all that much, but I've studied Greece extensively.

01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:26.160
It's a big part of my college education.

01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:30.440
And one of the things, just a great example that's very easy for people to analyze and

01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:33.640
understand is that, you know the word barbarian?

01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:34.640
You know where it comes from?

01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:35.640
No.

01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:36.640
It comes from the Greek.

01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:37.640
Barbary.

01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:43.720
Barbaros, which is a term for people outside invading because they thought that everybody

01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:44.720
who didn't...

01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:45.720
Do you mean immigrants?

01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:46.720
Yeah, they did.

01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:49.480
They thought, well, they had a really interesting idea about having to take people into your

01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:50.480
home.

01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:51.480
Strangers, they had like a...

01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:52.480
They had a neighbor.

01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:53.480
Yeah.

01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:59.800
They had a very complicated thing with actual people, but big groups, they would...

01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:01.680
Barbarian comes from barbar.

01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:03.740
They thought that everyone just said barbar.

01:40:03.740 --> 01:40:06.240
They didn't respect anyone else's language or any culture.

01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:07.240
Oh.

01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:08.240
Yeah.

01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:09.240
It was like woof woof.

01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:10.720
It was just an onomatopoeia kind of thing.

01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:12.680
Those who say barbar became barbarians.

01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:13.680
Okay.

01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:15.640
And that's where the word comes from to this day.

01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:16.820
That's really fascinating.

01:40:16.820 --> 01:40:20.740
There's tons of stuff like that throughout the history of Greece and Rome.

01:40:20.740 --> 01:40:24.160
They were very terrible with other cultures and civilizations.

01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:25.160
Right.

01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:29.540
Secondly, the idea that Rome was like this great innovator that took things from other

01:40:29.540 --> 01:40:34.800
cultures and then made it better, they conquered everybody.

01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:35.800
They just took things.

01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:36.800
They killed everybody.

01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:37.800
They took things.

01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:38.800
Yeah.

01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:39.800
You know what else they took?

01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:40.800
Their land.

01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:41.800
They took over everything.

01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:42.800
They were an empire.

01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:43.800
Yeah.

01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:44.800
They were a complete empire.

01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:50.240
So then, the idea that the West is the great innovators, I would just have pulled up a

01:40:50.240 --> 01:41:00.120
list of Chinese inventions, paper, printing, movable type, gunpowder, compass, alcoholic

01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:07.200
beverages, bells, wooden coffins, daggers, lacquer, millet cultivation, noodles, rowing

01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:15.160
ores, plowshares, pottery, pottery urns, the ability to cultivate rice, soybean cultivation,

01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:19.560
acupuncture, banknotes.

01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:20.560
You know what?

01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:21.560
We can stop at acupuncture.

01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:22.560
Belts.

01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:25.480
I think you should have just stopped right before acupuncture, actually.

01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:26.480
Belts.

01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:27.480
Bombs.

01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:28.480
Blast furnaces.

01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:29.480
Bristle toothbrushes.

01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:30.480
Cast iron.

01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:35.920
So what you're saying is that it is directly the Chinese fault for the Holocaust.

01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:37.960
I think the Chinese cause the Holocaust.

01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:46.680
Most types of drill, color printing, crossbows, dominoes.

01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:51.920
The thing that drives me insane, before I get, I think everybody gets your point.

01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:52.920
Fire lands.

01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:53.920
I think everybody gets your point.

01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:54.920
Fireworks.

01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:55.920
Fishing reels.

01:41:55.920 --> 01:41:56.920
I think everybody gets your point.

01:41:56.920 --> 01:41:57.920
Flame throwers.

01:41:57.920 --> 01:41:58.920
I think zero people have not gotten your point at this point.

01:41:58.920 --> 01:41:59.920
Fragmentation bombs.

01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:03.400
Wait, why are we proud of fragmentation bombs?

01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:04.400
I don't know.

01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:07.840
Hey, let's talk about India and what they've invented.

01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:14.400
In the third millennium BC, the Indians invented a flushing toilet.

01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:17.080
They invented a fucking flushing toilet.

01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:18.940
The Indians invented the ruler.

01:42:18.940 --> 01:42:20.840
They invented the weighing scale.

01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:24.880
They invented all sorts of ways to fuck with metal.

01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:29.560
The Indians invented the plow that was used to- I think I understand what it was he was

01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:33.440
talking about when he said he didn't want to reveal Hillary Clinton's information because

01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:34.440
it was self-indulgent.

01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:35.440
Shampoo.

01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:37.440
The Indians invented shampoo.

01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:40.160
The word is based on an Indian word.

01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:42.180
They invented tons of games that we use.

01:42:42.180 --> 01:42:45.900
Shoots and ladders is based on an Indian game called Snakes and Ladders.

01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:48.920
Well then I will never forgive them.

01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:58.040
No, no, so here's the thing that I hear though- The Indians invented indigo dye.

01:42:58.040 --> 01:42:59.400
All right, I'm done.

01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:00.760
That's actually pretty amazing.

01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:02.400
Although that is the cheapest dye.

01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:03.400
So I wear blue jeans.

01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:07.600
You and I both listen to that episode of Dala.

01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:08.600
Exactly.

01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:09.600
All right.

01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:10.600
Yes.

01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:14.220
The Knowledge Fight, the podcast that references other podcasts.

01:43:14.220 --> 01:43:16.880
We've gone too so far into this episode.

01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:24.080
But here's the bigger thing that he just misses entirely.

01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:30.320
You pointed out, look at all of these inventions in China and India.

01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:34.540
And then he talks about the West being Rome and all of those places.

01:43:34.540 --> 01:43:37.080
Who the fuck was right in the middle?

01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:40.260
Who the fuck put together all of these things?

01:43:40.260 --> 01:43:42.880
He says the West was the melting pot?

01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:45.880
That is unbelievable bullshit.

01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:52.320
Like the Silk Road began and end in the middle.

01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:55.100
It didn't start on the West or the East.

01:43:55.100 --> 01:43:59.600
It was right there in the fucking middle, in the Middle East.

01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:04.960
It was those civilizations that came from Iraq.

01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:09.240
Those places were the ones that made us all what we are.

01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:14.320
And the fact that he pretends that it's the East or the West boggles my mind.

01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:17.360
That is a complete misrepresentation of all of history.

01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:20.960
And we don't have fucking time to go through all of the Middle Eastern countries and their

01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:21.960
innovation.

01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:22.960
Just start with zero.

01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:25.120
The number zero.

01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:30.640
Or Africa, the things that have come out of Africa or South America.

01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:35.120
All the world's cultures have had innovation within them.

01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:38.840
All the world's cultures have brought us amazing things that we use.

01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:39.840
And the most-

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:40.840
It's fucking absurd.

01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:48.280
The important part is that the areas where they all met, the areas where everybody mixed,

01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:53.520
that's where things got a lot better and a lot more interesting a lot faster.

01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:56.920
Everywhere where it's isolated, everywhere.

01:44:56.920 --> 01:45:02.480
When you're talking about Africa, especially in the historical context, generally people

01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:05.480
wind up talking about Egypt.

01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:07.040
Those central parts of Africa-

01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:08.040
Because it had access.

01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:09.040
Exactly.

01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:15.600
Where you can still see indigenous people today, they are so isolated that they never

01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:18.280
wound up interacting with all of this insane stuff.

01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:21.120
Because they weren't in the North and they weren't close to other-

01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:22.120
Yep.

01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:23.120
And they didn't have ports.

01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:24.120
Yeah.

01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:25.120
Like Egypt had ports.

01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:26.120
Exactly.

01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:31.000
So you had people that came in boats from far off lands and had to go through them in

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:32.320
order to do anything.

01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:33.320
Exactly.

01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:34.320
The idea of the West-

01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:36.760
That's how the Library of Alexandria got so big and then burned down.

01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:44.720
The idea of isolation is the idea of completely removing any innovation or invention or anything

01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:45.720
like that.

01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:46.720
Nationalism.

01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:47.720
Exactly.

01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:48.720
Yeah.

01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:49.720
It's a great plan.

01:45:49.720 --> 01:45:53.480
If you want the world to die, nationalism is the way you do it.

01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:54.480
All right.

01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:59.120
So I mean, Alex has a lot of really fucked up views about the West and he's wrong about

01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:01.200
most of them, as we've discussed.

01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:03.080
But get this.

01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:06.400
This next clip is super bizarre.

01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:12.760
We know Alex Jones as a man who's primarily against tyranny.

01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:14.840
That is what he's afraid of.

01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:16.640
Theoretically primarily against tyranny.

01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:18.680
Well, based on his words.

01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:24.480
His sort of world conception is that the liberals are not really liberals.

01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:29.600
They want to push socialism, which will lead to communism, which will lead to a totalitarian

01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:31.680
regime tyranny.

01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:33.580
That is his big fear.

01:46:33.580 --> 01:46:37.360
He doesn't understand how much fewer steps it takes to get to tyranny.

01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:38.360
We're there.

01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:39.360
We're way past it.

01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:40.360
We're real close.

01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:41.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:44.240
But he has this like, that is what has driven his career.

01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:48.920
Now, as I talked about at the beginning of this episode, there's also that weird pseudo-spiritual

01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:54.120
shit that's going on in the background, but in terms of what he's really willing to present

01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:58.400
as his overarching theme, it's a fight against tyranny.

01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:01.660
That is how he sort of presents himself all the time.

01:47:01.660 --> 01:47:05.440
This next clip is super fucked up when you keep that in mind.

01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:09.600
The globalists do not want you to be perceptive.

01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:11.480
They do not want you to be powerful.

01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:13.600
They do not want you to be free.

01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:16.480
They are incredible enslavers.

01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:20.120
And all I know is they're not good.

01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:24.960
They claim they're engaging in all this tyranny to bring in a total control system to protect

01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:28.640
the earth from wars and factions killing each other.

01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:29.640
That's not right.

01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:30.880
I'll be honest with you.

01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:34.760
If there was a quasi-tyranny, I'm just going to be totally honest from now on, that had

01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:40.520
good friends and empowered individuals, but went and shut down really bad people, I would

01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:44.560
say it was a lesser of evils, very dangerous, might become the ultimate tyranny down the

01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:50.160
road, but I wouldn't fight it to the point of putting my full will against it to where

01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:51.960
I try to force his hand against me.

01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:54.460
What the fuck does that mean?

01:47:54.460 --> 01:47:57.980
What he just said is tyranny is cool as long as it's on my side.

01:47:57.980 --> 01:47:59.560
As long as it's the right kind of tyranny.

01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:00.840
As long as it's on my side.

01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:01.840
Right.

01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:04.080
That's incredibly fucked up.

01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:06.200
That should invalidate most of his beliefs.

01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:07.640
That should invalidate everything.

01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:10.440
That means he has no principles, he's just on a team.

01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:12.760
It's just that his team is weird.

01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:21.080
His team is not the republicans necessarily, it's not even libertarians, it's anti-government

01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:23.320
weird constitutionalists.

01:48:23.320 --> 01:48:31.420
That really is one of those things where you do point back, like, I shit all over the founding

01:48:31.420 --> 01:48:36.600
congresses, I refuse to call them the founding fathers.

01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:37.600
That's fucking annoying.

01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:38.920
It's patriarchal.

01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:39.920
Fucking annoying.

01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:42.680
Not patriarchal, just very...

01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:43.680
It's like saying the...

01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:45.880
Call them the founding daddies.

01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:51.560
It's like saying the Pledge of Allegiance, it's super weird, just in a gross way.

01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:56.040
But the Framers of the Constitution, I don't know why that's better for me.

01:48:56.040 --> 01:48:58.320
It doesn't have fathers in the name.

01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:01.520
The guys who jerked off onto paper and made it words.

01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:02.520
Sure.

01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:05.480
They did an ooky cookie with the paper.

01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:07.640
I am trying so hard to get to a point.

01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:09.240
Which you are failing at.

01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:10.240
Awful.

01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:16.560
The one thing that I do give them is that all of those guys really did come from it

01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:18.520
from different angles.

01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:25.440
Like there were, in general, the same concept of Republicans and Democrats that we have

01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:26.440
now.

01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:30.800
Well, it's flipped, but there were a bunch of times that there were liberal and conservative

01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:31.800
folk.

01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:32.800
Yes, progressive and conservative.

01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:33.800
Yeah, yeah.

01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:36.800
I mean, Jefferson and Washington had incredibly different perspectives.

01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:37.800
Exactly.

01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:38.800
Exactly.

01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:41.940
And they disagreed with each other loud and hard.

01:49:41.940 --> 01:49:46.280
But at the end of the day, all of them were against kings.

01:49:46.280 --> 01:49:47.280
Yeah.

01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:48.280
Tyranny.

01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:50.520
They didn't fucking throw everything.

01:49:50.520 --> 01:49:51.520
You guys want taxes?

01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:52.520
I hate taxes.

01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:54.580
But no fucking kings.

01:49:54.580 --> 01:49:55.920
Like they all agreed on that.

01:49:55.920 --> 01:49:58.720
And you know what else they would not be thrilled with?

01:49:58.720 --> 01:49:59.720
Quasi-kings.

01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:00.720
Yeah.

01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:01.720
Yeah.

01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:03.280
I'm cool with quasi-tyranny.

01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:05.120
Maybe it turns into tyranny down the road.

01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:06.120
But right now it's quasi-tyranny.

01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:08.440
And it might be the most dangerous thing ever.

01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:09.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:10.440
What is that?

01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:11.440
No.

01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:17.760
That is the one thing that you can point to with our overarching idea of the overarching

01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:24.200
idea of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution is no kings.

01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:28.320
And right now we have a political party that is for kings.

01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:30.280
Well, I mean, you look at it.

01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:36.200
Well, and probably 40% of the other party is, like the way that we've expanded executive

01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:40.720
powers is beyond reason, especially under Obama.

01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:41.720
Totally.

01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:47.200
Now that was maybe in response to the fact that we had the most obstructive Congress

01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:48.440
in history.

01:50:48.440 --> 01:50:52.160
And so the only way to actually get anything done is for Obama to be like, fuck it, I'm

01:50:52.160 --> 01:50:53.160
doing it.

01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:57.800
And the largest financial crisis in recorded, not recorded history, but in recent memory.

01:50:57.800 --> 01:50:58.800
Definitely not recorded history.

01:50:58.800 --> 01:50:59.800
No, but in recent memory.

01:50:59.800 --> 01:51:00.800
Yeah, absolutely.

01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:06.000
And a bunch of wars and the fact that our healthcare system was in desperate need of

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:07.000
something.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Yeah.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.420
There's a whole list of reasons why it happened.

01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:11.420
It's not good, though.

01:51:11.420 --> 01:51:12.960
But that's how you get tyranny.

01:51:12.960 --> 01:51:13.960
Right.

01:51:13.960 --> 01:51:18.400
And a whole bunch of crises come together and people fuck up along the way.

01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:23.240
And once Trump gets away with everything that he's been doing, we'll be 100% there.

01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:27.280
He has, he will and has gotten away with everything.

01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:28.280
Yep.

01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:30.780
And Alex will cheerlead all the way.

01:51:30.780 --> 01:51:36.880
So also a couple more points about this September 15th episode before we get to more clips.

01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:43.120
It opened with a Jon Bound report that was about how Assad is a real cool dude doing

01:51:43.120 --> 01:51:44.240
a great job in Syria.

01:51:44.240 --> 01:51:45.840
All he's doing is fighting ISIS.

01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:46.840
Yeah.

01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:47.840
Yeah.

01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:48.840
Nonsense.

01:51:48.840 --> 01:51:49.840
Fighting ISIS.

01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:51.600
Also, I realized why so many episodes start with a Jon Bound report.

01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:57.600
And that is because the radio stations start at six of the hour.

01:51:57.600 --> 01:52:00.440
The shows start at six after.

01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:04.040
They have their commercials and station identification or what have you.

01:52:04.040 --> 01:52:07.480
And so almost every episode of the show now starts with a Jon Bound report.

01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:09.580
And I'm like, why is he on every fucking day?

01:52:09.580 --> 01:52:10.580
These reports are terrible.

01:52:10.580 --> 01:52:15.440
And it's just because he got to fill time until the stations actually pick up the show.

01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:21.040
So yeah, they're doing more pro Assad stuff, more pro Russia business.

01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:28.720
Then being pro Assad is such a, such a perfect bellwether of whether or not you should kill

01:52:28.720 --> 01:52:29.720
yourself.

01:52:29.720 --> 01:52:30.720
Yeah.

01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:32.840
Like if you're pro Assad, just fucking die now.

01:52:32.840 --> 01:52:33.840
I'm okay with that.

01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:39.240
Alex is super mad about a story that he read about LA trying to call themselves the capital

01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:40.720
of Latin America.

01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:44.120
Uh, well, you know why they did that?

01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:47.520
It was a desperate sales pitch to try and get the Olympics.

01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:50.800
I was going to say, I'm sorry, the world cup, they were trying to get the world cup to come

01:52:50.800 --> 01:52:57.320
to LA and it was part of a PR campaign talking about how, uh, you know, North America is

01:52:57.320 --> 01:53:02.600
one and you know, they are the capital of Latin America and Alex is like, no, it's just

01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:04.920
about the North American union coming together.

01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:07.040
This is them coming out into the open globalist.

01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:13.680
No, they wanted to make a ton of money in Los Angeles by, well, in regards to the world

01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:18.400
cup, a very small amount of people wanted to make a very large amount of money and fuck

01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:19.640
over everybody.

01:53:19.640 --> 01:53:21.000
And thankfully that didn't happen.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Yeah.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:26.720
But although they will probably get the Olympics, so they'll be fucking us over in some way.

01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:30.200
And that's why I, that's why I had that brain fart calling at the Olympics.

01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:37.440
But be that as it may, uh, we need to check in Alex, like I said, in that, uh, a couple

01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:43.680
of, a couple of days back called Trump a punk, called him, told him to shut his fat mouth.

01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:48.300
And then the next day Trump backpedaled, Trump backpedaled and Alex softened.

01:53:48.300 --> 01:53:53.520
So now we've got to check in Alex Jones on this 15th of September has some thoughts about

01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:54.520
Trump.

01:53:54.520 --> 01:53:55.520
Here's where we're at.

01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:58.480
When I get mad at Rand Paul and say he should be more aggressive and sound more like Trump

01:53:58.480 --> 01:54:01.340
because I love Rand Paul, I know he's for real.

01:54:01.340 --> 01:54:02.340
I support him.

01:54:02.340 --> 01:54:03.340
I want him to win.

01:54:03.340 --> 01:54:09.240
I trust him, but I know he's listening to more milk toast political advisors that say

01:54:09.240 --> 01:54:14.200
that Trump's going to get destroyed in a general election because he's too extreme.

01:54:14.200 --> 01:54:15.200
He's not extreme.

01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:17.320
I don't know if I trust Trump or not.

01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:22.680
I don't know him, but I do know what he's saying is true.

01:54:22.680 --> 01:54:24.240
And that's why he's so popular.

01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:25.720
We're back to where we started.

01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:27.920
Of course we have made no progress.

01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:28.920
None.

01:54:28.920 --> 01:54:29.920
He went.

01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:30.920
It just went back.

01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:31.920
Back.

01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:32.920
Back.

01:54:32.920 --> 01:54:33.920
Yeah.

01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:34.920
It just.

01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:35.920
There is there is a will they won't they thing going on.

01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:38.720
And the baseline is I like what he's saying, but I don't trust him.

01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:46.100
I think his real problem so far seems to be that Rand Paul actually believes in what Alex

01:54:46.100 --> 01:54:50.960
Jones says he believes and Alex Jones doesn't actually believe in what he says he believes.

01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:52.600
That might be part of the tension.

01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:54.980
Like that's what it seems to me like.

01:54:54.980 --> 01:54:57.760
And I think Rand Paul's a little smarter than Alex.

01:54:57.760 --> 01:55:00.160
Rand Paul is so much smarter than Alex.

01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:06.760
But in terms of knowing like what is possible, what isn't possible, I think Rand Paul's also

01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:08.160
a fucking dick.

01:55:08.160 --> 01:55:09.160
Absolutely.

01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:11.520
I think he's a disaster.

01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:16.960
He seems to be an ideologically consistent dick, which is something that we cannot say

01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:17.960
about Alex.

01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:18.960
No.

01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:19.960
He just said he's cool with partial tyranny.

01:55:19.960 --> 01:55:20.960
Yeah.

01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:21.960
So yeah.

01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:22.960
Alex is nonsense.

01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:23.960
It's a complete mess.

01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:24.960
So.

01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:25.960
Alex is the wind.

01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:27.520
He blows wherever it may.

01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:31.840
On this episode, he has that interview with the guy from the Citizens for Guns or whatever.

01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:33.800
I can't remember the name of the organization.

01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:34.800
And I'll tell you this.

01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:35.800
Citizens for Guns.

01:55:35.800 --> 01:55:36.800
It's not important.

01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:37.800
That might as well be.

01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:38.800
Might as well be the name.

01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:39.800
Yeah.

01:55:39.800 --> 01:55:43.120
It's just a guy who's super into guns.

01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:46.160
And he has a terrible Skype.

01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:49.680
He's just sitting in a room doing this interview with Alex.

01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:53.660
And they end up having this conversation.

01:55:53.660 --> 01:55:58.360
This is the second instance of complete historical revisionism.

01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:02.020
I think it's slightly less offensive than the Holocaust denial that Alex engaged in

01:56:02.020 --> 01:56:05.060
previously, but it is just as whack.

01:56:05.060 --> 01:56:08.000
Federal government, you can go here and no farther.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:12.520
And if you try, then the Second Amendment comes into play.

01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:18.400
To put it a little bit more crudely, we'll point our guns at you if you try to act tyrannically.

01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:22.520
And that's in the Declaration of Independence, in the Constitution, in the Bill of Rights.

01:56:22.520 --> 01:56:25.680
The war started over them coming to take the guns.

01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:30.200
It doesn't matter how many quack professors they pay from Bloomberg to write books claiming

01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:32.000
it wasn't about guns.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:35.000
It was all about self-defense.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:36.720
It's always about self-defense.

01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:39.080
It's always about being free.

01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:42.280
The Revolutionary War was about guns.

01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:43.280
Yeah.

01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:44.280
The UK.

01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:45.280
That's obvious.

01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:46.280
Okay.

01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:47.280
Who has not read history?

01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:48.280
Alex.

01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:52.080
Don't you remember in 1776 when they wrote the Declaration of Independence, they were

01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:55.560
like, guns!

01:56:55.560 --> 01:56:57.800
That's why it was the Second Amendment.

01:56:57.800 --> 01:57:04.080
Yeah, I think that there were more issues about taxation, certainly.

01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:06.880
Alex loves to bring up tariffs when he talks about the Civil War.

01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:09.080
This one might be more appropriate.

01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:10.080
There was that.

01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:11.080
There was the lack of recourse.

01:57:11.080 --> 01:57:14.080
There was a lack of redress of grievances.

01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:16.240
There was no representation.

01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:19.080
Those sorts of issues seem to be more important.

01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:24.280
I know that the tea party, the Boston Tea Party, was not about guns.

01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:25.280
I know that.

01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:26.280
Hmm.

01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:27.280
Maybe it was.

01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:28.280
What else you got?

01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:29.280
Maybe it was.

01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:30.280
What else you got?

01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:31.280
Maybe they were throwing...

01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:32.280
Give me six more examples.

01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:34.120
I don't need to.

01:57:34.120 --> 01:57:35.600
Alex has no examples.

01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:36.600
None.

01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:37.600
I mean...

01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:38.600
It's just an assertion.

01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:43.080
It's just an assertion that the Revolutionary War was about guns.

01:57:43.080 --> 01:57:45.120
What?

01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:50.640
I mean, what do you say to a person who believes that?

01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:54.820
What do you say to somebody who believes that the Civil War was about states' rights or

01:57:54.820 --> 01:57:56.440
tariffs?

01:57:56.440 --> 01:57:59.320
What words are possible?

01:57:59.320 --> 01:58:02.120
I think that there's a way, though, to...

01:58:02.120 --> 01:58:03.720
Tariffs, no.

01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:04.720
That's not true.

01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:11.840
But I think there is a way to look back on what happened in the course of the Civil War

01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:18.000
and rewrite it reasonably with the states' rights.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.440
It's not what was going on then.

01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:22.440
This is gonna be a dangerous argument for me to make.

01:58:22.440 --> 01:58:24.400
This is already dangerous territory.

01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:31.400
I think that in hindsight, you can make the argument that what they were trying to argue

01:58:31.400 --> 01:58:33.260
was states' rights.

01:58:33.260 --> 01:58:37.520
That we should be able to decide whatever is legal in our state, federal government,

01:58:37.520 --> 01:58:38.520
get out, whatever.

01:58:38.520 --> 01:58:39.520
Uh-huh.

01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:40.520
Like, I think you can do that.

01:58:40.520 --> 01:58:45.360
You can't use what they were saying back then to make your argument, because it's not true.

01:58:45.360 --> 01:58:46.960
It's clearly about slavery.

01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:48.960
But you could do that.

01:58:48.960 --> 01:58:53.100
I don't think you can do that with the Revolutionary War being about guns.

01:58:53.100 --> 01:58:54.100
Absolutely not.

01:58:54.100 --> 01:58:55.100
Because I don't think that...

01:58:55.100 --> 01:58:56.100
Do you know what...

01:58:56.100 --> 01:59:02.520
I don't think the primary disagreement between the British and us was gun ownership.

01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:10.200
Do you know what the primary disagreement that is a through line between the Revolutionary

01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:11.760
War and the Civil War?

01:59:11.760 --> 01:59:12.760
What's that?

01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:14.280
Rich people are fucking us over.

01:59:14.280 --> 01:59:15.760
Yeah, that's true.

01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:18.520
That's what the argument has been.

01:59:18.520 --> 01:59:20.800
That's what the argument has always been.

01:59:20.800 --> 01:59:23.840
And in the Revolutionary War, it was the rich British are fucking us over.

01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:24.840
Yep.

01:59:24.840 --> 01:59:25.840
And the Civil War...

01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:27.920
It was the rich Southerners are fucking us over.

01:59:27.920 --> 01:59:28.920
Yeah.

01:59:28.920 --> 01:59:29.920
It was the rich...

01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:32.520
The rich people are...

01:59:32.520 --> 01:59:36.320
Okay, and I don't want to pull out a...

01:59:36.320 --> 01:59:39.320
And the Southerners were rich because they were enslaving people.

01:59:39.320 --> 01:59:40.520
Exactly.

01:59:40.520 --> 01:59:43.320
And it wasn't even the Southerners.

01:59:43.320 --> 01:59:45.840
It was a very small number of Southerners.

01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:48.180
And then it was racism.

01:59:48.180 --> 01:59:52.480
It was the propaganda that they'd been fed the whole time about how black people aren't

01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:54.040
even really people.

01:59:54.040 --> 01:59:55.640
It is always...

01:59:55.640 --> 02:00:02.200
And I'm not gonna pull a hardcore socialist argument out.

02:00:02.200 --> 02:00:08.040
I am just going to point out the same thing that has always been true, that it's a rich

02:00:08.040 --> 02:00:10.480
man's war and a poor man's fight.

02:00:10.480 --> 02:00:14.160
Rich people always wind up fucking fine.

02:00:14.160 --> 02:00:18.000
They always wind up winning, regardless of who wins.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.240
Oh, fuck, fucking fuck.

02:00:20.240 --> 02:00:21.240
Fuck you.

02:00:21.240 --> 02:00:22.240
They're smart.

02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:23.240
They're fucking insane.

02:00:23.240 --> 02:00:28.680
I mean smart in terms of cunning, in terms of an evil ability to, no matter what the

02:00:28.680 --> 02:00:33.080
outcome, I'm gonna benefit from it.

02:00:33.080 --> 02:00:35.760
They're privy to more information than everybody else.

02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:37.640
They're not smart.

02:00:37.640 --> 02:00:39.140
It's like insider training.

02:00:39.140 --> 02:00:40.780
It's not like they're brilliant.

02:00:40.780 --> 02:00:43.000
It's that they know a day...

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:48.720
The guys who voted on the healthcare bill were like, okay, well, we're gonna invest

02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:56.440
in the same day on companies that stand to profit from this exact vote.

02:00:56.440 --> 02:00:57.960
It's not that they're smarter than us.

02:00:57.960 --> 02:01:00.180
It's that they're fucking us over.

02:01:00.180 --> 02:01:04.000
But it's manipulating a system that we allow to continue.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:05.000
Yeah, exactly.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:06.000
So Jordan.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:07.000
Yes.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:10.680
Before September 15th, something really fucked up happened.

02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:19.040
September 14th, Donald Trump had a rally in Texas, and Joe Biggs went to the rally.

02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:23.680
Oh, I bet he has some insider information we would never have found out without him.

02:01:23.680 --> 02:01:30.520
Now, I have a couple clips from Joe Biggs reporting about going to the Trump rally that

02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:39.000
I think bring into sharp focus the moment when Alex Jones realized Trump's the way to

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:40.000
go.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:41.000
Really?

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:42.000
Yeah.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:43.000
No shit.

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:48.280
Now, I'm not entirely sure about this, and Alex doesn't give a lot of indications that

02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:52.840
I'm correct, but I will make my argument over the course of the next three or four clips.

02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:56.320
Two or three hours, basically, is what you just said.

02:01:56.320 --> 02:01:58.540
No, we got way more than that.

02:01:58.540 --> 02:02:03.360
Here is the first clip of Joe Biggs reporting about going to the Trump rally.

02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:06.320
And again, it is not what you'd expect.

02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:07.320
Gotta get to the Trump situation.

02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:09.360
So you're up there for Lord Trump-ish.

02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:10.360
What happened?

02:02:10.360 --> 02:02:13.760
I went in there with an open mind, you know?

02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:15.600
He says a lot of good things out there, you know?

02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:20.120
He's definitely a crowd pleaser, and I wrote down on this piece of paper that he was lackluster.

02:02:20.120 --> 02:02:24.640
He's lackluster in the sense that he's not motivated or convicted in a sense when it

02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:26.740
comes to the issues at hand.

02:02:26.740 --> 02:02:31.840
Issues that a presidential candidate should be, you know, have conviction in, have knowledge

02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:32.840
in.

02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:36.840
When he's asked certain questions about these issues, he doesn't have a really good answer.

02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:37.840
He doesn't know what he's doing.

02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:38.840
Because he doesn't know what they fucking are!

02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:42.640
They're kind of reminding me of Rodney Dangerfield with these one-liners, like, hey, we got a

02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:43.640
border problem, huh?

02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:45.080
What are we going to do about it?

02:02:45.080 --> 02:02:46.080
Let's build a wall.

02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:48.280
All right, so what is a wall going to do?

02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:51.760
All he does is he brings problems to the table without a solution.

02:02:51.760 --> 02:02:54.960
And that's what I heard last night, a whole lot of problems being brought to the table

02:02:54.960 --> 02:02:59.920
without him giving any kind of clear path to how he was going to give a solution to

02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:01.500
these issues.

02:03:01.500 --> 02:03:05.280
We know a wall won't work contiguously.

02:03:05.280 --> 02:03:08.940
What really works is prosecuting people that hire illegals.

02:03:08.940 --> 02:03:14.280
So at this point, Joe Biggs is doing slightly reasonable reporting.

02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:16.100
That actually sounds pretty reasonable.

02:03:16.100 --> 02:03:21.000
And I'm going to get into this next clip, but that's the beginning of the two of them

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:25.760
kind of advocating for reasonable, moderate immigration reform.

02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:31.960
And Trump, er, Jones saying that a wall won't work is mind-boggling.

02:03:31.960 --> 02:03:34.760
When months later, he's screaming about a wall.

02:03:34.760 --> 02:03:35.760
We need a wall.

02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:36.760
Yeah, absolutely.

02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:37.760
No.

02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:38.760
A wall is the most important thing.

02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:39.760
Yeah.

02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:42.140
Guatemala, there's a wall on the border of Guatemala and Mexico.

02:03:42.140 --> 02:03:43.140
Which there isn't.

02:03:43.140 --> 02:03:49.420
He even has, later, like a couple days past this, he has an interview with Jesse Ventura.

02:03:49.420 --> 02:03:53.600
And Jesse Ventura lives in Mexico, and he's like, what about the wall between Mexico and

02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:54.600
Guatemala?

02:03:54.600 --> 02:03:57.440
And he's like, I don't know if that exists.

02:03:57.440 --> 02:03:58.440
It doesn't.

02:03:58.440 --> 02:03:59.440
It 100% doesn't.

02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:00.440
Of course not.

02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:01.440
He's like, I've never been down there.

02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:02.440
I don't know.

02:04:02.440 --> 02:04:03.440
Like, well, they're also looking into it.

02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:04.440
It doesn't exist.

02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:09.700
The last wall that was similar to the one that Trump proposes was the Berlin Wall.

02:04:09.700 --> 02:04:13.200
Which Jesse Ventura also brings up a bunch, and he's great for it.

02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:16.120
But at this point, like, Joe Biggs is making sense.

02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:18.080
He's absolutely making sense.

02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:19.080
Trump has a bunch of-

02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:20.640
He's about to bring the hammer down.

02:04:20.640 --> 02:04:21.640
Not yet.

02:04:21.640 --> 02:04:23.440
Trump has a bunch of problems.

02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:24.440
No solutions.

02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:25.440
He's up there.

02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:26.440
He doesn't have a grasp of the issues.

02:04:26.440 --> 02:04:27.440
A lot of bluster.

02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:28.440
Doesn't know what he's talking about.

02:04:28.440 --> 02:04:31.520
He's just coming in with Rodney Dangerfield-style one-liners.

02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:33.640
All this is, but he's a showman.

02:04:33.640 --> 02:04:34.640
Right.

02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:35.640
Kind of makes sense.

02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:41.440
In this next clip, they talk a little bit more about immigrant stuff, and Alex is, like,

02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:43.440
surprisingly moderate.

02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:44.760
It's very weird.

02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:49.200
For the months that we've listened to him screaming about how the globalists are trying

02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:55.600
to flood us with, you know, people who may need to get rid of them, or not let them in,

02:04:55.600 --> 02:04:56.600
this-

02:04:56.600 --> 02:04:57.600
Comparing the man-

02:04:57.600 --> 02:04:58.600
Hold on.

02:04:58.600 --> 02:04:59.600
Listen to-

02:04:59.600 --> 02:05:00.600
Comparing the man we know now versus the man that we're talking about-

02:05:00.600 --> 02:05:01.600
No.

02:05:01.600 --> 02:05:02.600
I'm talking about the last few months in 2015.

02:05:02.600 --> 02:05:03.600
Oh, in 2015.

02:05:03.600 --> 02:05:04.600
Okay.

02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:05.600
Yeah.

02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:07.840
He's been screaming about fucking immigrants the whole time that we've been doing this

02:05:07.840 --> 02:05:08.840
investigation.

02:05:08.840 --> 02:05:09.840
No, absolutely.

02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:10.840
Yeah.

02:05:10.840 --> 02:05:11.840
So, I mean, I'm not talking about present-day Alex.

02:05:11.840 --> 02:05:16.520
I'm talking about the present-day Alex versus the previous Alex in terms of the wall.

02:05:16.520 --> 02:05:17.520
Right, right, right.

02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:18.520
That boggles my mind.

02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:19.520
It's nuts.

02:05:19.520 --> 02:05:20.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:05:20.520 --> 02:05:21.520
It's nuts.

02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:23.240
It's complete evidence that he's sold himself out.

02:05:23.240 --> 02:05:24.840
His principles mean nothing.

02:05:24.840 --> 02:05:25.840
Agreed.

02:05:25.840 --> 02:05:31.440
So, here is the- I've labeled this clip, Joe and Alex seem very moderate on immigration

02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:32.440
reform.

02:05:32.440 --> 02:05:35.760
You know, Donald Trump said in two years he's going to have every illegal out of the country.

02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:39.720
The only way you could do that, it was just like I was fucking Michaela Thelen back there,

02:05:39.720 --> 02:05:40.720
it would be like Nazi Germany.

02:05:40.720 --> 02:05:44.880
They're going to have to go door to door and find out, are you an American?

02:05:44.880 --> 02:05:45.880
I need to see proof.

02:05:45.880 --> 02:05:46.880
And that's what's going to happen.

02:05:46.880 --> 02:05:49.840
That's the only way you're going to get all the illegals out.

02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:53.000
But then at the same time, you still have illegals in the country who want to do good.

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:58.120
And we're not even saying- all we're saying is don't say free welfare, free babies, come

02:05:58.120 --> 02:06:02.440
here and have the Democrats sign them up to anti-gun groups and give them fake voting

02:06:02.440 --> 02:06:03.440
cards.

02:06:03.440 --> 02:06:04.440
Guns!

02:06:04.440 --> 02:06:07.640
But at the same time, that's reasonable.

02:06:07.640 --> 02:06:11.840
If that was his actual position and if it reflected reality in any way, that's a pretty

02:06:11.840 --> 02:06:12.840
reasonable position.

02:06:12.840 --> 02:06:13.840
It's not terrible.

02:06:13.840 --> 02:06:18.480
It's not what he actually believes, but it's the way he presents things.

02:06:18.480 --> 02:06:19.480
Joe Biggs-

02:06:19.480 --> 02:06:23.120
That's like a McCain Republican idea.

02:06:23.120 --> 02:06:29.520
Like in 2008 when McCain ran, like that's the kind of idea of like, hey, we know a lot

02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:33.800
of people are good, but we just don't want you taking advantage of a system.

02:06:33.800 --> 02:06:36.440
And so we're going to do things- we're going to take steps to stop that.

02:06:36.440 --> 02:06:39.960
And as we already have covered when Jesse Ventura was last on, he was talking about

02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:45.700
like, I'm not sure if these people are getting the programs that you say they are.

02:06:45.700 --> 02:06:47.200
They're not because it's not possible.

02:06:47.200 --> 02:06:48.200
Right.

02:06:48.200 --> 02:06:52.280
But if they are, why would you not blame the system as opposed to the person who is just

02:06:52.280 --> 02:06:53.280
trying to survive?

02:06:53.280 --> 02:06:54.280
Exactly.

02:06:54.280 --> 02:06:56.400
And that is a far more reasonable stance.

02:06:56.400 --> 02:07:00.600
But Joe Biggs is coming in here and Trump is saying he's going to get rid of all the

02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:01.600
illegal immigrants.

02:07:01.600 --> 02:07:05.760
And he's like, that's impossible without turning into a fucking police state.

02:07:05.760 --> 02:07:06.760
Probably not.

02:07:06.760 --> 02:07:08.760
Which would require some sort of tyranny.

02:07:08.760 --> 02:07:09.760
Yeah.

02:07:09.760 --> 02:07:13.040
Joe Biggs is pushing back against that and Alex is fine with the push.

02:07:13.040 --> 02:07:14.440
It's crazy.

02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:20.280
This next clip- Do we just diverge entirely from that?

02:07:20.280 --> 02:07:21.440
No, not yet.

02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:22.440
No, not yet?

02:07:22.440 --> 02:07:23.440
What's happening?

02:07:23.440 --> 02:07:26.440
This next clip is still sensible.

02:07:26.440 --> 02:07:28.040
We're not even critics of Trump here.

02:07:28.040 --> 02:07:30.880
I mean, Joe just wanted to see what he was really like.

02:07:30.880 --> 02:07:37.160
Yeah, but a lot of it is like a Rodney Dangerfield one liner.

02:07:37.160 --> 02:07:39.080
Why do folks like him so much then?

02:07:39.080 --> 02:07:40.080
He's a crowd pleaser.

02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:43.000
He definitely knows how to work a crowd and that's what he was doing.

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:46.160
He didn't have, the first thing he talked about when he showed up, hey, this is teleprompter

02:07:46.160 --> 02:07:47.160
free.

02:07:47.160 --> 02:07:48.160
We don't have any.

02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:51.920
And he rambled on about how you made $215 million on The Apprentice.

02:07:51.920 --> 02:07:54.560
It took 30 minutes before he even named an issue.

02:07:54.560 --> 02:07:59.480
And when he did, he talked about this vague tax plan that he had and that in a few weeks

02:07:59.480 --> 02:08:02.720
he's going to release this- Sure, he appealed like a carnival barker

02:08:02.720 --> 02:08:03.720
to success.

02:08:03.720 --> 02:08:08.920
But everyone was in there screaming and yelling, women crying, babies screaming, signs flying

02:08:08.920 --> 02:08:09.920
up through the air.

02:08:09.920 --> 02:08:11.400
Well that just shows how desperate people are.

02:08:11.400 --> 02:08:15.760
So basically he's just saying there's no substance to what he's saying.

02:08:15.760 --> 02:08:18.720
He's a showman, he's a carnival barker.

02:08:18.720 --> 02:08:23.360
But at the end there, they're talking about how even with that lack of substance, people

02:08:23.360 --> 02:08:25.380
are going crazy.

02:08:25.380 --> 02:08:30.220
They were in an arena that was full of people.

02:08:30.220 --> 02:08:36.160
Trump is able to draw these crowds, these massive crowds, that are mind blowing.

02:08:36.160 --> 02:08:38.720
Oh, he would be booked at the improv immediately.

02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:39.720
Totally.

02:08:39.720 --> 02:08:40.720
He could do a set.

02:08:40.720 --> 02:08:41.720
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:42.720
He's like Steve-O.

02:08:42.720 --> 02:08:43.720
He's terrible, but fuck it.

02:08:43.720 --> 02:08:44.720
Yeah, he can get a weekend.

02:08:44.720 --> 02:08:45.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

02:08:45.720 --> 02:08:46.720
Trump's stapling his balls to his leg.

02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:49.240
Now I'd pay for that.

02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:50.480
Yeah, well.

02:08:50.480 --> 02:08:54.280
So I think that this is sort of- I would pay for me stapling Trump's balls

02:08:54.280 --> 02:08:55.280
to his leg.

02:08:55.280 --> 02:08:56.280
Yeah, you need to do it.

02:08:56.280 --> 02:08:57.280
That's weird.

02:08:57.280 --> 02:08:58.280
Oh, I need to do it.

02:08:58.280 --> 02:09:04.440
So this next clip, I think we've heard a lot of a very reasonable perspective that Joe

02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:13.080
Biggs has from going to this Trump rally, but I think we're going to start to see here-

02:09:13.080 --> 02:09:14.800
It's gonna start to deteriorate?

02:09:14.800 --> 02:09:15.800
Well maybe-

02:09:15.800 --> 02:09:17.320
This will be the beginning of the end?

02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:18.320
Maybe.

02:09:18.320 --> 02:09:21.240
And I'll make my point after this clip and the next one.

02:09:21.240 --> 02:09:23.600
Also, do you know how great Todd Glass is?

02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:24.600
It's hilarious.

02:09:24.600 --> 02:09:29.760
I can't- any time you bring up Rodney Dangerfield now, I don't think of Rodney Dangerfield.

02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:37.080
I think of Todd Glass doing Mitch Hedberg jokes in Rodney Dangerfield's voice.

02:09:37.080 --> 02:09:38.080
He's the best.

02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:39.080
It's just amazing.

02:09:39.080 --> 02:09:41.040
Anyway, not the best is this.

02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:44.480
Well, I definitely had an agenda when I went up there as well.

02:09:44.480 --> 02:09:48.640
I wore my Hillary for a prison 2016 t-shirt under my suit.

02:09:48.640 --> 02:09:50.320
By the way, that's a best seller.

02:09:50.320 --> 02:09:51.320
We have photos.

02:09:51.320 --> 02:09:52.320
At least you sent me those photos, Joe.

02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:54.360
Yeah, yeah, they should be all on my Twitter right now as well.

02:09:54.360 --> 02:09:58.920
And I have footage of myself, I'm in the front row, I suck up to the front row, and I'm sitting

02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:01.080
there, I'm kind of getting nervous a little bit, I was like, alright, I gotta do it, I

02:10:01.080 --> 02:10:02.080
gotta do it.

02:10:02.080 --> 02:10:05.640
And I undid my shirt like Superman, and you can see the Hillary for prison shirt, and

02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:09.520
I jumped up and screamed right in a lull, like a little silence part, and I go, Hillary

02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:10.520
for prison!

02:10:10.520 --> 02:10:13.480
And Trump's like, yeah, Hillary, and he's like, pointing at me.

02:10:13.480 --> 02:10:15.800
So if you guys have that clip, we can show it really quick.

02:10:15.800 --> 02:10:16.800
Did not happen.

02:10:16.800 --> 02:10:17.800
Oh, we have a video clip of that?

02:10:17.800 --> 02:10:18.800
Yeah, yeah.

02:10:18.800 --> 02:10:19.800
Oh, I didn't even know we had that video clip.

02:10:19.800 --> 02:10:20.800
I just gave it to Nico.

02:10:20.800 --> 02:10:21.800
Did that for real happen?

02:10:21.800 --> 02:10:22.800
It did.

02:10:22.800 --> 02:10:23.800
It did.

02:10:23.800 --> 02:10:32.720
And it was, uh, Trump is in the middle of saying something that the crowd likes, and

02:10:32.720 --> 02:10:38.680
Joe Biggs rips his shirt open, and he's got Hillary for prison, he yells Hillary for prison,

02:10:38.680 --> 02:10:42.040
and Trump is like, you know who's not surging in the polls?

02:10:42.040 --> 02:10:43.040
Hillary.

02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:44.040
And he's like, thank you.

02:10:44.040 --> 02:10:45.640
And he just points over at Joe Biggs.

02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:47.540
That's the extent of the interaction.

02:10:47.540 --> 02:10:48.560
But hear me out on this.

02:10:48.560 --> 02:10:52.960
So Joe Biggs has been jerking off for three years based on that, right?

02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:56.440
Joe Biggs went there as a marketing possibility.

02:10:56.440 --> 02:11:02.000
The idea of going there and finding out what's going on with Trump was secondary to the idea

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.840
of field testing this Hillary for prison shirt.

02:11:04.840 --> 02:11:10.320
So he goes there as a marketing opportunity because Trump has pulled an arena full of

02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:14.460
people to Texas, which there might be audience crossover with.

02:11:14.460 --> 02:11:19.040
So Joe Biggs goes down there, he does the Superman thing, and people seem to really

02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:20.040
like it.

02:11:20.040 --> 02:11:21.040
Now listen to this next clip.

02:11:21.040 --> 02:11:22.040
Oh no.

02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:25.840
So I opened up my shirt, and the entire crowd erupted.

02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:29.680
And you could see these different reporters or a man gets standing ovation for showing

02:11:29.680 --> 02:11:30.680
his Hillary for prison shirt.

02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:33.720
And it got to a point where I just ended up pulling the blazer off in the top and just

02:11:33.720 --> 02:11:34.720
had the shirt going.

02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:37.960
And see, anybody could have done what you gotta love the fact you always went with great

02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:38.960
ideas.

02:11:38.960 --> 02:11:39.960
You're always making the news.

02:11:39.960 --> 02:11:42.840
You're always making people, you know, linking to what we're doing.

02:11:42.840 --> 02:11:43.840
Great job, Joe.

02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:46.280
Well, I'm telling you, I probably told the least.

02:11:46.280 --> 02:11:48.040
This is probably, you know, nice.

02:11:48.040 --> 02:11:53.040
Maybe a thousand people with Infowars was, I want to see the spike in the site last night

02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:54.040
because people were all on their phone.

02:11:54.040 --> 02:11:55.040
Where do I get that?

02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:56.600
I was like, you gotta go to the Infowars store, man.

02:11:56.600 --> 02:11:57.600
You're gonna love it.

02:11:57.600 --> 02:12:00.040
So sorry about the sound on the clips from this episode.

02:12:00.040 --> 02:12:02.240
It was just glitchy and there was nothing I could do about it.

02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:07.180
But beyond that, I think that this is the moment.

02:12:07.180 --> 02:12:08.180
This is it.

02:12:08.180 --> 02:12:09.840
The Hillary for prison shirt.

02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:16.040
It's because of the potential sales of Hillary for prison shirts that they pull on the...

02:12:16.040 --> 02:12:19.360
They don't say it there at all.

02:12:19.360 --> 02:12:26.120
But I fucking love and hate how my perspective keeps changing based on the information that

02:12:26.120 --> 02:12:27.400
we keep getting.

02:12:27.400 --> 02:12:32.640
But I legitimately think that that moment for them is transformative.

02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:33.640
Holy fuck.

02:12:33.640 --> 02:12:35.400
Because they realize this is a whole market we can tap into.

02:12:35.400 --> 02:12:42.400
Your argument is Alex Jones loves Trump now because of t-shirt sales.

02:12:42.400 --> 02:12:45.160
Well, even go beyond t-shirt sales.

02:12:45.160 --> 02:12:48.200
It's a market, a fertile market that we can tap into.

02:12:48.200 --> 02:12:51.520
Alex Jones couldn't get an arena of people to show up somewhere.

02:12:51.520 --> 02:12:52.520
Of course not.

02:12:52.520 --> 02:12:53.640
Trump shows up to town.

02:12:53.640 --> 02:12:56.040
He's got a whole stadium full of people.

02:12:56.040 --> 02:13:01.440
Joe Biggs comes in, charms them, does some like grifty door to door salesmanship with

02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:02.440
their shirts.

02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:04.000
I imagine behind the scenes they did...

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:07.040
What do I need you to do to get you into a t-shirt today?

02:13:07.040 --> 02:13:10.760
I imagine, I don't know this, but I imagine behind the scenes they saw a spike in traffic

02:13:10.760 --> 02:13:11.960
to the site.

02:13:11.960 --> 02:13:15.720
Everybody got a bunch of sales from it and they're like, this might be something we need

02:13:15.720 --> 02:13:16.720
to do.

02:13:16.720 --> 02:13:17.720
Wow.

02:13:17.720 --> 02:13:18.720
So I think that...

02:13:18.720 --> 02:13:21.920
I mean, I think we always knew that there would be some sort of crass capitalism to

02:13:21.920 --> 02:13:22.920
it.

02:13:22.920 --> 02:13:23.920
Totally.

02:13:23.920 --> 02:13:25.800
But this is, this is too much, right?

02:13:25.800 --> 02:13:27.600
Well, that's field testing it though.

02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:28.600
Yeah.

02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:29.600
That's taking it to the streets.

02:13:29.600 --> 02:13:30.600
Taking it to the streets.

02:13:30.600 --> 02:13:31.600
All right.

02:13:31.600 --> 02:13:32.600
Quote the doobs.

02:13:32.600 --> 02:13:33.600
All right.

02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:34.600
We're done with that.

02:13:34.600 --> 02:13:38.520
So that's where we leave off on the 15th.

02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:42.120
There's a whole bunch of other dumb bullshit that happens on that show.

02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:47.320
Alex Jones does reveal, he doesn't want to reveal it, but he does say that it costs him

02:13:47.320 --> 02:13:51.880
over $15 million to run Infowars for a year.

02:13:51.880 --> 02:13:52.880
Okay.

02:13:52.880 --> 02:13:56.600
So if you take that number and you consider...

02:13:56.600 --> 02:13:59.360
That seems, that seems honest.

02:13:59.360 --> 02:14:01.280
That seems to make sense, right?

02:14:01.280 --> 02:14:03.280
About $15 million makes sense.

02:14:03.280 --> 02:14:08.500
Well, yeah, it's, it's in the realm of believable, especially considering he runs it out of

02:14:08.500 --> 02:14:10.240
Texas and what have you, but...

02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:11.960
Say he's exaggerating as always.

02:14:11.960 --> 02:14:14.760
I would say $10 million does make sense though.

02:14:14.760 --> 02:14:16.160
That's me in the middle at 12th.

02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:18.960
But be that as it may, it doesn't matter.

02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:21.540
I'm glad you and I can come to a detente on this.

02:14:21.540 --> 02:14:27.660
It doesn't really matter whether the number is 10 or 15, because the money bomb that we're

02:14:27.660 --> 02:14:31.120
about to get into, because we're about to jump into the 16th, which is the beginning

02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:35.080
of the money bomb, 28 hour live broadcast.

02:14:35.080 --> 02:14:36.080
Jesus.

02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:39.120
He doesn't, he's trying to make a million dollars.

02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:40.120
Yeah.

02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:41.120
So that...

02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:42.960
Publicly, he's trying to make a million dollars.

02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:43.960
Right, but...

02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:46.080
He's trying to make a certain amount of money.

02:14:46.080 --> 02:14:47.080
Hopefully it's a million.

02:14:47.080 --> 02:14:48.080
Right.

02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:53.960
But all of the things that he says he wants to do with that million dollars is weird hypothetical

02:14:53.960 --> 02:14:59.040
stuff about shooting the show into Europe, which he said, which he said already, I'm

02:14:59.040 --> 02:15:00.720
not, we are not going to do that immediately.

02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:03.040
We're going to get the satellites, blah, blah, blah.

02:15:03.040 --> 02:15:04.040
Of course not.

02:15:04.040 --> 02:15:10.520
The best of it is stuff he's already doing, paying for reporters, paying for cameras,

02:15:10.520 --> 02:15:14.880
paying for syndication, paying for closed captioning.

02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:17.120
He's doing all of that already.

02:15:17.120 --> 02:15:22.640
So all of that million dollars is just operating expenses that he already has accrued.

02:15:22.640 --> 02:15:28.320
The idea that he needs this million dollars for future stuff is absurd.

02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:33.840
If you watch, I watch them, because these are, I watch this shit on YouTube, his studio

02:15:33.840 --> 02:15:36.320
looks exactly the same as it does now.

02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:44.360
There's no, from 2015 to 2017, there is no discernible change that has been made in terms

02:15:44.360 --> 02:15:45.680
of the studio.

02:15:45.680 --> 02:15:47.320
Yeah, but there's upkeep.

02:15:47.320 --> 02:15:51.560
There are no people who are there that aren't...

02:15:51.560 --> 02:15:52.560
Rappaport.

02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:54.360
No, fuck off.

02:15:54.360 --> 02:15:55.360
Rappaport works for free.

02:15:55.360 --> 02:15:57.360
Rappaport probably does work for free.

02:15:57.360 --> 02:15:58.360
Rappaport's a soldier.

02:15:58.360 --> 02:16:01.360
Rappaport probably does work for free.

02:16:01.360 --> 02:16:06.740
But hear me out, the way I wanted to end that sentence is there isn't a greater number of

02:16:06.740 --> 02:16:10.600
people that work there that aren't balanced out by the less number of people who have

02:16:10.600 --> 02:16:13.200
quit since this change happened.

02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:19.160
So there isn't really like a wide expansion that has happened.

02:16:19.160 --> 02:16:24.560
He's pretended that an expansion in his audience has happened, but if you look at these statistics

02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:30.080
that are available on Quantcast and other tracking sources, that hasn't happened.

02:16:30.080 --> 02:16:33.420
If you look at the numbers that are on his YouTube videos even, they aren't what he says

02:16:33.420 --> 02:16:34.420
they are.

02:16:34.420 --> 02:16:38.120
Unless you add all of them up and assume that all of them are different people.

02:16:38.120 --> 02:16:44.160
But be that as it may, he's trying to raise money for a fictitious thing that didn't happen.

02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:48.800
Yeah, now I understand your point.

02:16:48.800 --> 02:16:57.180
To me though, it seems like it's exactly the same thing as an NPR, like, hey, we do live

02:16:57.180 --> 02:17:00.800
entirely upon public money.

02:17:00.800 --> 02:17:08.800
But because he can't supplicate himself, because he can't be somebody who asks for operating

02:17:08.800 --> 02:17:11.120
costs, he has to say it this way.

02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:12.120
It's possible.

02:17:12.120 --> 02:17:13.120
So to me, it's a-

02:17:13.120 --> 02:17:15.720
Like a hyper-masculine NPR?

02:17:15.720 --> 02:17:16.720
It's a fundraiser.

02:17:16.720 --> 02:17:18.820
It's a hyper-masculine fundraiser.

02:17:18.820 --> 02:17:21.280
That's what it seems like to me so far.

02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:22.280
Right.

02:17:22.280 --> 02:17:27.640
So basically, NPR is not going to go hypothetically out of business if they don't make the money

02:17:27.640 --> 02:17:29.040
by the end of the year.

02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:30.040
True.

02:17:30.040 --> 02:17:31.440
And I feel the panic in Alex.

02:17:31.440 --> 02:17:34.840
I don't think he's going to go out of business, he would have to downsize.

02:17:34.840 --> 02:17:36.640
Reduce his standard of living.

02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:38.240
Yeah, exactly.

02:17:38.240 --> 02:17:41.680
The reason that it strikes me as false, and I understand what you're saying, and I think

02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:43.400
there is a kernel of it.

02:17:43.400 --> 02:17:50.840
Because I know that it's easy for us to give a pass to NPR, because we're bougie-ass liberals,

02:17:50.840 --> 02:17:54.200
and be like, hey, Alex is trying to raise money, what a dumbass.

02:17:54.200 --> 02:17:55.840
And that's what he would think we're doing.

02:17:55.840 --> 02:17:59.880
Which, by the way, you can donate to Knowledge Fight if you go to the Knowledge Fight website

02:17:59.880 --> 02:18:00.960
and click on our link.

02:18:00.960 --> 02:18:01.960
Thank you to all the policy wonks.

02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:02.960
But that's not-

02:18:02.960 --> 02:18:04.720
No, for real, thank you to all the policy wonks.

02:18:04.720 --> 02:18:07.000
That's not at all what I'm getting at.

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:14.780
The circumstances of it are much more interesting, because he's presenting a fictitious expansion

02:18:14.780 --> 02:18:16.000
of the show.

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:17.000
So that's one.

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:18.000
Right.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:21.840
He's saying it at the end of the fiscal year, which is two.

02:18:21.840 --> 02:18:28.000
And then the third is he's in this will-they-won't-they situation with Trump that is super fucked

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:29.400
up.

02:18:29.400 --> 02:18:31.600
That's the thing I think we're talking about.

02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:34.960
It's not about that he needs money.

02:18:34.960 --> 02:18:41.700
It's that because he needs money, there is motive there in order to make the pivot.

02:18:41.700 --> 02:18:43.000
That's what we're talking about.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:50.640
And NPR is never going to do a fundraiser and then stealth vote for a candidate because

02:18:50.640 --> 02:18:51.640
of it.

02:18:51.640 --> 02:18:52.640
No.

02:18:52.640 --> 02:19:00.520
Legitimate news sources don't have-they aren't doing subversive marketing.

02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:08.520
The Guardian is now saying, hey, journalism needs to be paid for.

02:19:08.520 --> 02:19:13.920
And rather than put us behind a paywall, we need you to donate to it, or we'd like it

02:19:13.920 --> 02:19:16.200
if you donated to it.

02:19:16.200 --> 02:19:23.920
At no point would the Guardian all of a sudden become the fucking Daily Mail because Trump

02:19:23.920 --> 02:19:26.480
gave them-well, at least we would hope not.

02:19:26.480 --> 02:19:27.680
I would hope not.

02:19:27.680 --> 02:19:30.680
Because Trump gave them ten million dollars or whatever.

02:19:30.680 --> 02:19:38.920
Ultimately I believe that there is probably a future better civilization that involves

02:19:38.920 --> 02:19:46.360
all public financing for presidential campaigns, political campaigns, and journalism.

02:19:46.360 --> 02:19:49.880
Public financing for campaigns and journalism does make a lot of sense.

02:19:49.880 --> 02:19:52.480
Those sorts of things need to be incredibly unbiased.

02:19:52.480 --> 02:19:58.440
And it's impossible to have no bias, like we fucking hate Alex Jones and we hate Trump.

02:19:58.440 --> 02:20:01.840
But at the same time- Whoa, I'm unbiased about Trump.

02:20:01.840 --> 02:20:07.640
I think you can go back and look at my previous statements and note that I have no bias.

02:20:07.640 --> 02:20:12.040
Our bias is incredibly clear, but at the same time when Alex Jones has said stuff that's

02:20:12.040 --> 02:20:16.600
like yeah, rock and roll, we've been totally cool with it.

02:20:16.600 --> 02:20:20.240
We don't hate him in such a way that we will never give him props.

02:20:20.240 --> 02:20:25.520
Also Alex, you really need to look into what Jeff Sessions is doing with civil asset forfeiture.

02:20:25.520 --> 02:20:26.520
Oh my god.

02:20:26.520 --> 02:20:28.600
So far, no comment on that that I've seen.

02:20:28.600 --> 02:20:29.600
Unbelievable.

02:20:29.600 --> 02:20:30.840
He might have talked about it and I missed it.

02:20:30.840 --> 02:20:31.900
If it did, I apologize.

02:20:31.900 --> 02:20:37.560
So if Sessions did or didn't commit a crime- He did, he did.

02:20:37.560 --> 02:20:44.760
Because he's under investigation for it, don't we get to take his stuff by his own rules?

02:20:44.760 --> 02:20:45.760
That's a great point.

02:20:45.760 --> 02:20:47.120
Don't we get to steal his stuff?

02:20:47.120 --> 02:20:48.760
You gotta steal those assets.

02:20:48.760 --> 02:20:50.480
I want to seize his assets.

02:20:50.480 --> 02:20:53.160
So- Can we make a citizen's civil forfeiture?

02:20:53.160 --> 02:20:55.520
That would be great.

02:20:55.520 --> 02:20:57.800
I would just like to take maybe 60 bucks from him.

02:20:57.800 --> 02:20:58.800
Oh, absolutely.

02:20:58.800 --> 02:21:01.220
Help me get to the end of the month.

02:21:01.220 --> 02:21:12.640
So speaking of things that have to do with money, Jordan, it is time for the money bomb!

02:21:12.640 --> 02:21:13.640
Here's the bad news.

02:21:13.640 --> 02:21:14.640
The money bomb?

02:21:14.640 --> 02:21:15.640
Let's edit that out.

02:21:15.640 --> 02:21:17.360
Let's edit out our- Oh, that's staying in.

02:21:17.360 --> 02:21:18.360
That's staying in.

02:21:18.360 --> 02:21:19.360
Don't worry.

02:21:19.360 --> 02:21:20.360
All right.

02:21:20.360 --> 02:21:24.020
That, the money bomb, is incredibly boring.

02:21:24.020 --> 02:21:25.280
Of course it is.

02:21:25.280 --> 02:21:27.640
27 hours or whatever the fuck it was?

02:21:27.640 --> 02:21:30.840
I didn't watch any of it that didn't have Alex Jones on it.

02:21:30.840 --> 02:21:31.840
Smart.

02:21:31.840 --> 02:21:37.120
But there is one piece that I wish I had watched, that I didn't watch, and I won't.

02:21:37.120 --> 02:21:38.440
Because why would I do that?

02:21:38.440 --> 02:21:39.640
Why would I put myself through it?

02:21:39.640 --> 02:21:42.740
Yeah, you've already hurt yourself enough on our behalf.

02:21:42.740 --> 02:21:46.760
Here's something that we didn't realize about the money bomb.

02:21:46.760 --> 02:21:49.300
It is at the end of the fiscal year.

02:21:49.300 --> 02:21:52.000
But do you know what else happened on September 16th?

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:53.000
No!

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:56.160
The second Republican presidential debate.

02:21:56.160 --> 02:21:57.160
Ooooh.

02:21:57.160 --> 02:22:00.560
So they timed it to be on the night of the debate.

02:22:00.560 --> 02:22:02.480
Oh shit, that's really smart.

02:22:02.480 --> 02:22:03.480
Yeah.

02:22:03.480 --> 02:22:04.480
That's really smart of them.

02:22:04.480 --> 02:22:05.480
Yeah.

02:22:05.480 --> 02:22:06.480
You gotta give them credit for that.

02:22:06.480 --> 02:22:07.480
That's brilliant.

02:22:07.480 --> 02:22:11.760
So during the debate, what they did is Leanne McAdoo, David Knight, and I think Rob Doo?

02:22:11.760 --> 02:22:13.560
I can't remember the third person.

02:22:13.560 --> 02:22:18.320
But they had a panel that Mystery Science Theatered the debate.

02:22:18.320 --> 02:22:21.440
So what they did is they had their silhouettes on the desk.

02:22:21.440 --> 02:22:22.440
No shit.

02:22:22.440 --> 02:22:24.760
All on the backs of their heads.

02:22:24.760 --> 02:22:25.760
Wow.

02:22:25.760 --> 02:22:26.760
Fucking wow.

02:22:26.760 --> 02:22:30.280
And I saw a couple clips of it and it's lunacy.

02:22:30.280 --> 02:22:33.560
They didn't even hire Mike Nelson for like a day?

02:22:33.560 --> 02:22:34.560
Nothin'.

02:22:34.560 --> 02:22:36.480
No, no professionals on this.

02:22:36.480 --> 02:22:37.880
No fake robot either.

02:22:37.880 --> 02:22:42.360
Like you could, Alex, it would be so easy to just create a robot to put in there.

02:22:42.360 --> 02:22:43.960
You could get even probably the real gypsy.

02:22:43.960 --> 02:22:44.960
Who cares?

02:22:44.960 --> 02:22:45.960
Oh, yeah.

02:22:45.960 --> 02:22:46.960
He hates gypsies though.

02:22:46.960 --> 02:22:47.960
I should be good about that.

02:22:47.960 --> 02:22:48.960
Alright.

02:22:48.960 --> 02:22:49.960
I don't like even using the word gypsy.

02:22:49.960 --> 02:22:54.520
On October 10th he did talk about how the gypsies have free reign to steal RVs in Europe.

02:22:54.520 --> 02:22:55.520
Nope.

02:22:55.520 --> 02:22:56.520
Nope.

02:22:56.520 --> 02:22:57.520
Nope.

02:22:57.520 --> 02:22:58.520
Yep.

02:22:58.520 --> 02:23:01.640
That's a fucking racist thing from the 1700s.

02:23:01.640 --> 02:23:03.520
What are you doing talking about gypsies?

02:23:03.520 --> 02:23:04.520
It's wild.

02:23:04.520 --> 02:23:12.760
So the schedule of the 27 hour, 28 hour broadcast was really disappointing.

02:23:12.760 --> 02:23:16.960
They had that, you know, Mystery Science Theater, blah blah.

02:23:16.960 --> 02:23:22.280
They had Alex Jones for his show on the beginning of it on the 16th.

02:23:22.280 --> 02:23:25.360
The Alex Jones show on the 17th.

02:23:25.360 --> 02:23:32.520
Beyond that it was just like, they're reporters, tag teamed, like Kit Daniels did a show.

02:23:32.520 --> 02:23:33.520
Never heard Kit Daniels name.

02:23:33.520 --> 02:23:34.520
He's a writer.

02:23:34.520 --> 02:23:35.520
He's a writer guy.

02:23:35.520 --> 02:23:38.000
He's not really on air all that much.

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:39.000
Some of these...

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.160
That always goes well when you put a writer guy on air.

02:23:41.160 --> 02:23:47.320
Some of these other guys, like just people, Rob Doo interviewed Leo Zagami, the Illuminati

02:23:47.320 --> 02:23:49.560
insider who hates the Pope.

02:23:49.560 --> 02:23:51.560
They did that at midnight.

02:23:51.560 --> 02:23:52.560
Not at midnight.

02:23:52.560 --> 02:23:53.680
That was like 2am.

02:23:53.680 --> 02:23:55.560
It was just nonsense.

02:23:55.560 --> 02:24:00.600
They had fucking Paul Joseph Watson doing a bunch of stuff on the off hours because

02:24:00.600 --> 02:24:02.160
he's on Greenwich Mean Time.

02:24:02.160 --> 02:24:06.880
So it's, again, you're doing an overnight thing where no one has to stay up overnight

02:24:06.880 --> 02:24:08.520
except for Rob Doo.

02:24:08.520 --> 02:24:10.120
But be that as it may.

02:24:10.120 --> 02:24:15.840
Look, Rob Doo is kind of our tortured slave of Infowars here.

02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:19.840
I start to like him more and more as time goes on and I'm not comfortable with that.

02:24:19.840 --> 02:24:21.200
He's kind of, to me...

02:24:21.200 --> 02:24:22.200
He's an everyman.

02:24:22.200 --> 02:24:28.120
He's kind of a Charlie Brown, like there's the football right there and Rob Doo is about

02:24:28.120 --> 02:24:30.440
to kick it and it is always pulled out from underneath him.

02:24:30.440 --> 02:24:35.660
I think behind the scenes he's probably way worse than he appears because he just seems

02:24:35.660 --> 02:24:36.660
so boring.

02:24:36.660 --> 02:24:38.240
I bet behind the scenes he's a dick.

02:24:38.240 --> 02:24:39.240
Probably.

02:24:39.240 --> 02:24:41.640
He's been able to stay in this business for like years.

02:24:41.640 --> 02:24:42.960
That's a really good point.

02:24:42.960 --> 02:24:44.960
Unless he's Renfield.

02:24:44.960 --> 02:24:48.000
Have you considered that he is actually mind controlled by Alex Jones?

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:51.800
No, because I don't consider those sorts of things because they're lunatic.

02:24:51.800 --> 02:24:56.400
I think there's a decent chance there's a good person behind Rob Doo and that sucks

02:24:56.400 --> 02:24:57.860
because he's so fucking boring.

02:24:57.860 --> 02:25:02.040
But be that as it may, what we're going to be talking about is specifically and only

02:25:02.040 --> 02:25:05.860
the Alex Jones portions of the Money Bomb.

02:25:05.860 --> 02:25:10.680
So we're going to start with the 16th, Alex Jones wants to talk to you about his audience

02:25:10.680 --> 02:25:11.680
size.

02:25:11.680 --> 02:25:12.680
Oh boy.

02:25:12.680 --> 02:25:13.840
I bet it's pretty big.

02:25:13.840 --> 02:25:17.920
They brought in the metrics to my house last night, Buckley Hammond and Anthony Gucciardi

02:25:17.920 --> 02:25:23.040
that I have working with outside IT consulting firms and they said you're giving people two

02:25:23.040 --> 02:25:24.920
year old numbers, here they are.

02:25:24.920 --> 02:25:29.800
They pulled them up in front of me on all the big third party sites and our own internal

02:25:29.800 --> 02:25:30.920
server systems.

02:25:30.920 --> 02:25:35.000
Info Wars now reaches 41 million individual different people a month.

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:43.000
It has a reach of 1.4 billion total views on the website.

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:49.520
If you count all of our social media, it is several billion more individual users.

02:25:49.520 --> 02:25:54.180
We did a metric run with a major company and looked at our YouTube views just on the top

02:25:54.180 --> 02:26:01.040
500 sites carrying our videos and it's over 150 million views a month and so they're now

02:26:01.040 --> 02:26:06.420
collating all of that data we'll be releasing soon, but it appears we're reaching upwards

02:26:06.420 --> 02:26:10.480
of three and a half billion individual people per month.

02:26:10.480 --> 02:26:17.000
There is six billion people that have some access to the internet, some access three

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:18.000
and a half.

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.800
How many people even live on the planet in your world?

02:26:20.800 --> 02:26:21.800
It's insane.

02:26:21.800 --> 02:26:22.800
What?

02:26:22.800 --> 02:26:23.800
What?

02:26:23.800 --> 02:26:25.280
In full disclosure.

02:26:25.280 --> 02:26:31.280
So six out of the seven billion people on this fucking planet have internet access.

02:26:31.280 --> 02:26:32.320
Which isn't true at all.

02:26:32.320 --> 02:26:34.440
That's not even close to true.

02:26:34.440 --> 02:26:35.440
No.

02:26:35.440 --> 02:26:40.400
Three point two, three point, between three point two and three point six billion have

02:26:40.400 --> 02:26:41.400
internet.

02:26:41.400 --> 02:26:42.400
Oh, okay.

02:26:42.400 --> 02:26:47.240
Well then all of them, all of them are Alex Jones listeners.

02:26:47.240 --> 02:26:52.240
Here's something that's very interesting, 700 billion of those people who have internet

02:26:52.240 --> 02:26:53.240
access.

02:26:53.240 --> 02:26:54.240
700 million of those people.

02:26:54.240 --> 02:26:55.240
I'm sorry.

02:26:55.240 --> 02:26:57.200
700 million of those people live in China.

02:26:57.200 --> 02:26:59.120
None of them have access to Infowars.

02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:00.460
Oh, that's right.

02:27:00.460 --> 02:27:02.120
They don't even have access to it.

02:27:02.120 --> 02:27:03.120
No way.

02:27:03.120 --> 02:27:04.120
It's censored.

02:27:04.120 --> 02:27:05.120
That's almost.

02:27:05.120 --> 02:27:06.120
Holy shit.

02:27:06.120 --> 02:27:09.680
That's almost a billion of the people who have access to the internet, who have a censored

02:27:09.680 --> 02:27:10.680
internet.

02:27:10.680 --> 02:27:14.200
Alex Jones spends all of his time talking about the chai comms and shit.

02:27:14.200 --> 02:27:15.200
There's no way they can do the filter.

02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:17.600
Yeah, there's no way they can watch, no shit.

02:27:17.600 --> 02:27:18.600
Of course not.

02:27:18.600 --> 02:27:20.180
So that's 700 million of them.

02:27:20.180 --> 02:27:22.200
Now it's literally impossible.

02:27:22.200 --> 02:27:27.360
Well that covers, so he said there's six billion listening to him, right?

02:27:27.360 --> 02:27:30.240
So that 700 million covers the extra billion.

02:27:30.240 --> 02:27:33.840
No, no, because he's talking about the people who have access to the internet.

02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:34.840
Oh, that's right.

02:27:34.840 --> 02:27:39.160
It's only three and a half million who actually listen, or three and a half billion who actually

02:27:39.160 --> 02:27:40.160
listen to him.

02:27:40.160 --> 02:27:41.160
No, no, no.

02:27:41.160 --> 02:27:42.160
He's saying that they reach.

02:27:42.160 --> 02:27:43.160
They reach.

02:27:43.160 --> 02:27:44.720
What does that even fucking mean?

02:27:44.720 --> 02:27:47.800
It's bullshit internet social media nonsense.

02:27:47.800 --> 02:27:52.800
It's the same reason he says that Paul Joseph Watson's videos have millions of views.

02:27:52.800 --> 02:27:57.640
It's because they post them on Facebook, and people scroll past it, it auto plays, and

02:27:57.640 --> 02:27:59.320
that counts as a play.

02:27:59.320 --> 02:28:00.320
It's the same-

02:28:00.320 --> 02:28:01.320
Is that real?

02:28:01.320 --> 02:28:02.320
Yeah.

02:28:02.320 --> 02:28:03.320
That actually counts as a play?

02:28:03.320 --> 02:28:04.320
Yeah.

02:28:04.320 --> 02:28:06.800
You look at all these nonsense videos that no one's watching, like ad videos, and it

02:28:06.800 --> 02:28:08.520
says like two million-

02:28:08.520 --> 02:28:11.440
I haven't been on Facebook for a good year.

02:28:11.440 --> 02:28:17.160
I remember this from back when I was trolling around on that dumb site.

02:28:17.160 --> 02:28:22.240
Looking up old girlfriends.

02:28:22.240 --> 02:28:29.880
That's what most people do, but also we really, really have to point out he's double, triple,

02:28:29.880 --> 02:28:31.700
and quadruple counting shit.

02:28:31.700 --> 02:28:36.820
There's absolutely no way, because he's talking about the top 100 sites that post our videos.

02:28:36.820 --> 02:28:40.440
Which we've already established is he's at like what?

02:28:40.440 --> 02:28:42.280
He's not even in the top 200?

02:28:42.280 --> 02:28:43.280
No, no, no.

02:28:43.280 --> 02:28:44.840
He's talking about the places that post his-

02:28:44.840 --> 02:28:45.840
Oh, okay.

02:28:45.840 --> 02:28:46.840
Okay, okay.

02:28:46.840 --> 02:28:49.800
Do you understand how YouTube's analytics work?

02:28:49.800 --> 02:28:50.800
Yes.

02:28:50.800 --> 02:28:55.320
Well, I mean no, but as you've explained them to me in regards to Alex Jonesy, yes.

02:28:55.320 --> 02:29:02.600
If you embed a video on your blog, let's say, from YouTube, and someone plays it from the

02:29:02.600 --> 02:29:07.200
blog, it counts as a hit on YouTube.

02:29:07.200 --> 02:29:14.840
But if there is this blog post that is about your video, you can count that as another

02:29:14.840 --> 02:29:15.840
hit.

02:29:15.840 --> 02:29:20.360
So it's two hits for every single person who does either.

02:29:20.360 --> 02:29:21.360
Right.

02:29:21.360 --> 02:29:24.040
So you've already doubled your hits even though it's only one view.

02:29:24.040 --> 02:29:27.160
Yeah, and Alex Jones is doing that all over the fucking place.

02:29:27.160 --> 02:29:33.480
So if there's like five websites, all of them you read because you're an avid info warrior.

02:29:33.480 --> 02:29:34.840
Right, and there's probably like-

02:29:34.840 --> 02:29:35.960
You get 10 views.

02:29:35.960 --> 02:29:39.360
WorldNetDaily reposts their stuff.

02:29:39.360 --> 02:29:45.840
Breitbart has in the past reposted their links and their videos.

02:29:45.840 --> 02:29:50.800
Well, just with the emails Trump has sent out to all of his donors with Info Wars links

02:29:50.800 --> 02:29:51.800
on it.

02:29:51.800 --> 02:29:55.240
And he's actually, like in that link, there was a video embedded.

02:29:55.240 --> 02:29:56.480
Yeah, of course.

02:29:56.480 --> 02:29:58.440
So that counts.

02:29:58.440 --> 02:29:59.920
That counts double.

02:29:59.920 --> 02:30:04.720
There's massive manipulation going on there in terms of the audience size, and that is

02:30:04.720 --> 02:30:07.200
exactly how you want to start the Money Bomb.

02:30:07.200 --> 02:30:08.200
Of course.

02:30:08.200 --> 02:30:09.200
That's how you want to start it.

02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:13.960
We're reaching 3.5 billion people a month.

02:30:13.960 --> 02:30:17.200
That's everyone in the world, because consider it.

02:30:17.200 --> 02:30:19.440
Think about how many children there are.

02:30:19.440 --> 02:30:20.780
You know what I'm saying?

02:30:20.780 --> 02:30:25.420
We talk about there being seven billion people, seven and a half billion people in the world.

02:30:25.420 --> 02:30:27.120
How many of those people are under 12?

02:30:27.120 --> 02:30:29.920
Most of them are dying and most of them are just born.

02:30:29.920 --> 02:30:30.920
Yeah.

02:30:30.920 --> 02:30:33.800
So 3.5 billion is every adult basically.

02:30:33.800 --> 02:30:35.660
Yeah, that is basic.

02:30:35.660 --> 02:30:37.440
That's more than every adult.

02:30:37.440 --> 02:30:38.440
Basically.

02:30:38.440 --> 02:30:39.440
Wow.

02:30:39.440 --> 02:30:42.520
And then you consider the amount of people who have no internet access, you consider

02:30:42.520 --> 02:30:46.240
the Chinese, and they're not the only country that restricts the internet.

02:30:46.240 --> 02:30:47.240
No, of course not.

02:30:47.240 --> 02:30:50.280
So you have other countries that have blocked internet, and you consider that-

02:30:50.280 --> 02:30:51.280
Saudi Arabia.

02:30:51.280 --> 02:30:52.280
Absolutely.

02:30:52.280 --> 02:30:53.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:30:53.280 --> 02:30:55.480
You consider those populations, his numbers make no fucking sense.

02:30:55.480 --> 02:30:56.880
His best way of trying to-

02:30:56.880 --> 02:30:59.160
At best, he's reaching 10 guys.

02:30:59.160 --> 02:31:00.160
Yeah.

02:31:00.160 --> 02:31:02.160
And one of them's me.

02:31:02.160 --> 02:31:03.160
Yeah.

02:31:03.160 --> 02:31:04.160
So you're down 10%.

02:31:04.160 --> 02:31:05.160
Exactly.

02:31:05.160 --> 02:31:06.160
Yeah.

02:31:06.160 --> 02:31:10.800
And he tries to sort of like couch it and he's like, now maybe people are coming to

02:31:10.800 --> 02:31:15.840
our site from different devices, so maybe we're reaching a billion a month.

02:31:15.840 --> 02:31:16.840
So would you-

02:31:16.840 --> 02:31:17.840
And even that's crazy.

02:31:17.840 --> 02:31:23.820
So wait, so if you check your Facebook on your computer, and then you check your Facebook

02:31:23.820 --> 02:31:26.760
on your phone, that counts as a different view.

02:31:26.760 --> 02:31:32.200
Well, I think if you track IP addresses, yeah, I think that is the case.

02:31:32.200 --> 02:31:36.120
Especially if you're using mobile, like if you're on the bus and you check your Facebook,

02:31:36.120 --> 02:31:38.360
it would be different than you checking it on your laptop at home.

02:31:38.360 --> 02:31:40.400
So that's multiple views on top of that.

02:31:40.400 --> 02:31:41.400
Yeah.

02:31:41.400 --> 02:31:46.400
And it makes it incredibly difficult to tell exactly what your metrics are, unless you

02:31:46.400 --> 02:31:47.400
have-

02:31:47.400 --> 02:31:48.680
Not sort of-

02:31:48.680 --> 02:31:51.600
He's not doing legit work in terms of his statistics.

02:31:51.600 --> 02:31:52.600
No, no, no, no, no, no.

02:31:52.600 --> 02:31:54.480
It's so crazy to me, but I love it.

02:31:54.480 --> 02:31:55.480
Of course not.

02:31:55.480 --> 02:31:56.480
I love it.

02:31:56.480 --> 02:31:57.480
I love it.

02:31:57.480 --> 02:31:58.480
That's the kind of stuff I love.

02:31:58.480 --> 02:31:59.600
Because after that-

02:31:59.600 --> 02:32:01.600
Because it's math.

02:32:01.600 --> 02:32:03.200
There's no arguing with math.

02:32:03.200 --> 02:32:08.360
But all of this other stuff, we can deal with reality versus non-reality.

02:32:08.360 --> 02:32:11.480
And there is a question there, and there are kernels of truth.

02:32:11.480 --> 02:32:16.400
In this regard, it is pure analytics, you're lying.

02:32:16.400 --> 02:32:17.400
And I cut the clip-

02:32:17.400 --> 02:32:18.400
And you know you're lying.

02:32:18.400 --> 02:32:19.400
Yeah.

02:32:19.400 --> 02:32:20.400
Yeah.

02:32:20.400 --> 02:32:25.400
And I cut the clip, and where he goes from there is to talk about how like, I'm humbled

02:32:25.400 --> 02:32:27.200
that I'm talking to this many people.

02:32:27.200 --> 02:32:29.880
It's like, do you know you're lying?

02:32:29.880 --> 02:32:30.880
What's going on here?

02:32:30.880 --> 02:32:31.880
It's just this present-

02:32:31.880 --> 02:32:32.880
He knows.

02:32:32.880 --> 02:32:36.520
It's just this presentation of humility that's really fascinating.

02:32:36.520 --> 02:32:37.520
But-

02:32:37.520 --> 02:32:38.520
He has to know.

02:32:38.520 --> 02:32:39.760
There's no possible way he doesn't know.

02:32:39.760 --> 02:32:43.560
Alex, beyond his bullshit about his audience size, he has some other things he wants to

02:32:43.560 --> 02:32:45.120
talk about on the Money Bomb.

02:32:45.120 --> 02:32:51.640
In this next one, Jordan, I've said a lot of things are not true that Alex Jones says

02:32:51.640 --> 02:32:53.640
in the past.

02:32:53.640 --> 02:32:54.640
This one-

02:32:54.640 --> 02:32:57.780
I don't know how many, but it's astronomical.

02:32:57.780 --> 02:33:01.360
It's maybe three and a half billion things that you have said are not true that Alex

02:33:01.360 --> 02:33:02.360
has said.

02:33:02.360 --> 02:33:03.840
That is bigly not true.

02:33:03.840 --> 02:33:05.200
Ooh, I don't like that one.

02:33:05.200 --> 02:33:08.080
Because I never get scared when I'm awake during the day.

02:33:08.080 --> 02:33:13.200
I always start crying when I think about this, because I don't want to leave my kids alone

02:33:13.200 --> 02:33:14.200
now more than ever.

02:33:14.200 --> 02:33:16.240
My children need me now more than ever.

02:33:16.240 --> 02:33:22.160
I'm pretty much the only people there for them, and I know in my heart that as all this

02:33:22.160 --> 02:33:26.160
unfolds, this show's going to get bigger and more popular to a dangerous level, because

02:33:26.160 --> 02:33:27.160
we know what's going on.

02:33:27.160 --> 02:33:28.160
You got freaked out by Muslim girls in a Starbucks.

02:33:28.160 --> 02:33:29.160
You're always scared.

02:33:29.160 --> 02:33:33.560
I told my globalist that I'll be just fine until all this comes true, and then that's

02:33:33.560 --> 02:33:36.240
when I better stop.

02:33:36.240 --> 02:33:37.240
I want to go back there, because-

02:33:37.240 --> 02:33:38.640
Yeah, go back and play that.

02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:41.080
I got angry, and it screwed everything up.

02:33:41.080 --> 02:33:42.080
I apologize.

02:33:42.080 --> 02:33:43.080
That's all right.

02:33:43.080 --> 02:33:47.600
And I've been told by top globalist that I'll be just fine until all this comes true, and

02:33:47.600 --> 02:33:49.480
then that's when I better stop.

02:33:49.480 --> 02:33:53.040
And the criticism is, what do you want money for if you're ready to stop?

02:33:53.040 --> 02:33:55.020
Oh, I'm not going to stop during the collapse.

02:33:55.020 --> 02:33:58.280
I'm going to go to the next level and put everything on the table and be all in.

02:33:58.280 --> 02:34:02.720
That's what you do when the enemy comes in like a flood.

02:34:02.720 --> 02:34:06.120
This is the end of the West, the end of humanity as we know it.

02:34:06.120 --> 02:34:08.100
This is a total satanic takeover.

02:34:08.100 --> 02:34:09.600
Don't you understand it's real?

02:34:09.600 --> 02:34:11.360
No, it's not.

02:34:11.360 --> 02:34:14.000
But you got told by a top globalist.

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
What top globalists are talking?

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:17.080
George Soros?

02:34:17.080 --> 02:34:18.520
Is he hanging out with Soros?

02:34:18.520 --> 02:34:19.520
Why is he...

02:34:19.520 --> 02:34:20.520
What?

02:34:20.520 --> 02:34:21.520
Okay.

02:34:21.520 --> 02:34:29.360
I believe that the globalists are demonic beings from a different dimension.

02:34:29.360 --> 02:34:34.480
Which I would say, if that is true, if you see one, kill it.

02:34:34.480 --> 02:34:35.480
Yeah, right?

02:34:35.480 --> 02:34:36.480
Right?

02:34:36.480 --> 02:34:38.840
Why would you have a patient conversation?

02:34:38.840 --> 02:34:41.280
Why would you go to a cocktail party with one?

02:34:41.280 --> 02:34:42.280
Hey, listen.

02:34:42.280 --> 02:34:47.200
I know you're a demonic monster hell-bent on destroying humanity, but come on, you got

02:34:47.200 --> 02:34:49.440
any juicy inside tips for me?

02:34:49.440 --> 02:34:50.760
I'm doing a radio show.

02:34:50.760 --> 02:34:51.760
Come on, man.

02:34:51.760 --> 02:34:52.760
Am I safe?

02:34:52.760 --> 02:34:53.760
Yeah.

02:34:53.760 --> 02:34:54.760
Am I?

02:34:54.760 --> 02:34:55.760
That's right, because that's what he's talking about.

02:34:55.760 --> 02:34:56.760
Yeah.

02:34:56.760 --> 02:35:00.800
He's talking to these top globalists who are like, keep on your shit.

02:35:00.800 --> 02:35:02.960
Well, no, this goes back to what we...

02:35:02.960 --> 02:35:06.280
Until we win, in which case you better get out.

02:35:06.280 --> 02:35:09.720
This goes back to what we were talking about at the beginning of this episode, this idea

02:35:09.720 --> 02:35:14.800
of the internet version of the elites and the Illuminati.

02:35:14.800 --> 02:35:17.720
They need to have everyone know what they're doing.

02:35:17.720 --> 02:35:18.720
Right.

02:35:18.720 --> 02:35:19.720
It's that lesser magic idea.

02:35:19.720 --> 02:35:21.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:35:21.480 --> 02:35:25.240
You need to know what we're doing to you, and then if you don't do anything, you consent

02:35:25.240 --> 02:35:26.740
to it.

02:35:26.740 --> 02:35:31.960
They're using Alex as a conduit to tell people what they're doing to them.

02:35:31.960 --> 02:35:34.840
And if they don't fight back, then whatever.

02:35:34.840 --> 02:35:35.840
Un-fucking-believable.

02:35:35.840 --> 02:35:41.040
But what's magical about that entire line of argument is, hey, the only way to really

02:35:41.040 --> 02:35:42.920
fight back is give Alex Jones money.

02:35:42.920 --> 02:35:43.920
Yeah.

02:35:43.920 --> 02:35:44.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:35:44.920 --> 02:35:46.440
He's the only one who's saying this crazy bullshit.

02:35:46.440 --> 02:35:52.320
I guess if I don't really support him, then I consented to being destroyed, and then demons

02:35:52.320 --> 02:35:53.320
are gonna take over.

02:35:53.320 --> 02:35:54.320
That is...

02:35:54.320 --> 02:35:55.320
It's brilliant.

02:35:55.320 --> 02:35:56.320
That is brilliant.

02:35:56.320 --> 02:35:57.320
It's brilliant.

02:35:57.320 --> 02:35:58.320
That is brilliant.

02:35:58.320 --> 02:35:59.320
It's so fucking stupid.

02:35:59.320 --> 02:36:00.320
I don't think you can...

02:36:00.320 --> 02:36:04.880
I don't think most of his listeners would be able to articulate exactly what line of...

02:36:04.880 --> 02:36:06.760
Or that train of logic that you just put forward.

02:36:06.760 --> 02:36:08.520
No, because they have too much fluoride in the water.

02:36:08.520 --> 02:36:10.040
But it makes perfect sense.

02:36:10.040 --> 02:36:11.040
Of course.

02:36:11.040 --> 02:36:12.040
If you're an insane person.

02:36:12.040 --> 02:36:13.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:36:13.040 --> 02:36:15.640
Or if you're just an afraid person, because that's what this...

02:36:15.640 --> 02:36:19.000
It's not that these people are all insane, it's that they're terrified and they don't

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:20.000
know what's going on.

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:26.160
I've spent a lot of periods of my life in various stages of paranoia and anxiety.

02:36:26.160 --> 02:36:30.720
I have mental illness, I've done a lot of drugs in the past, and so I know weird head

02:36:30.720 --> 02:36:31.720
spaces.

02:36:31.720 --> 02:36:32.720
Yeah.

02:36:32.720 --> 02:36:33.720
And I can sort of...

02:36:33.720 --> 02:36:36.000
I can suss out where things are coming from.

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:37.000
Right.

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:41.720
And I don't mean to put too fine a point on this, but I've dwelt in the weirdest parts

02:36:41.720 --> 02:36:42.720
of the internet.

02:36:42.720 --> 02:36:50.160
These conspiracy forums and these weird Illuminati forums, these message boards.

02:36:50.160 --> 02:36:54.880
I've read all this stuff that people talk about, and none of it's based on anything,

02:36:54.880 --> 02:36:57.900
and so much of it is mirrored in what Alex is talking about.

02:36:57.900 --> 02:37:04.320
This idea of the lesser magic, the idea that we've got to tell you, then you're in.

02:37:04.320 --> 02:37:05.800
It's so dumb.

02:37:05.800 --> 02:37:09.440
It's so based on nothing, and it's so manipulative.

02:37:09.440 --> 02:37:10.440
And that's what he's doing.

02:37:10.440 --> 02:37:11.440
It's great.

02:37:11.440 --> 02:37:12.440
I love it.

02:37:12.440 --> 02:37:13.440
I love it.

02:37:13.440 --> 02:37:14.440
I love it.

02:37:14.440 --> 02:37:15.440
I love it.

02:37:15.440 --> 02:37:16.440
Top globalists say he's safe.

02:37:16.440 --> 02:37:17.440
Why?

02:37:17.440 --> 02:37:18.440
What?

02:37:18.440 --> 02:37:19.440
Who is...

02:37:19.440 --> 02:37:22.440
How is he even getting a meeting with top globalists?

02:37:22.440 --> 02:37:23.440
He runs into them all the time.

02:37:23.440 --> 02:37:25.440
Remember, he talked to that one on the plane.

02:37:25.440 --> 02:37:26.440
Oh, that's right.

02:37:26.440 --> 02:37:27.440
He runs into them all the time.

02:37:27.440 --> 02:37:28.440
That's right.

02:37:28.440 --> 02:37:29.440
And they keep calling him, trying to get him to join up.

02:37:29.440 --> 02:37:30.440
They are everywhere.

02:37:30.440 --> 02:37:31.440
They need to join up.

02:37:31.440 --> 02:37:32.440
Absolutely.

02:37:32.440 --> 02:37:33.440
No, no, no.

02:37:33.440 --> 02:37:34.440
I got you.

02:37:34.440 --> 02:37:35.440
They're always courting Alex Jones.

02:37:35.440 --> 02:37:36.440
You're right.

02:37:36.440 --> 02:37:37.440
So Alex...

02:37:37.440 --> 02:37:45.080
He's a part of the mythology that, just like his fucking Prometheus bullshit, like, we

02:37:45.080 --> 02:37:47.560
need to be more like Prometheus, who God loved.

02:37:47.560 --> 02:37:49.760
And you're like, wait, no, hold on one second.

02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:50.760
You don't understand.

02:37:50.760 --> 02:37:51.760
No, no, no.

02:37:51.760 --> 02:37:52.760
You misinterpreted that.

02:37:52.760 --> 02:37:53.760
Oh, I did?

02:37:53.760 --> 02:37:54.760
Yeah.

02:37:54.760 --> 02:37:55.760
You misinterpreted that.

02:37:55.760 --> 02:37:56.760
How so?

02:37:56.760 --> 02:38:00.420
Because what he's saying is the God that I would be into, the elite version that I would

02:38:00.420 --> 02:38:04.160
be into, is that one who brings us Promethean fire.

02:38:04.160 --> 02:38:08.040
Now, Prometheus did bring us the fire, and then got his liver pecked out, and then brought

02:38:08.040 --> 02:38:09.040
back everything.

02:38:09.040 --> 02:38:10.040
He got wrecked for it.

02:38:10.040 --> 02:38:11.040
Yeah, yeah.

02:38:11.040 --> 02:38:12.040
But that's the human story.

02:38:12.040 --> 02:38:13.120
But that's the sacrifice that he makes for humanity.

02:38:13.120 --> 02:38:14.120
Yeah.

02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:18.520
So Alex's point is actually very valid in that case, is that the God that I would worship

02:38:18.520 --> 02:38:23.320
is the one that builds us up, because Prometheus did give us fire, and gave us that.

02:38:23.320 --> 02:38:25.360
I don't think there is one.

02:38:25.360 --> 02:38:26.360
No.

02:38:26.360 --> 02:38:29.880
Also, there's not a God.

02:38:29.880 --> 02:38:30.880
Shh, quiet.

02:38:30.880 --> 02:38:32.640
We have a lot of Christian knowledge fighters.

02:38:32.640 --> 02:38:33.640
Yeah, I bet we do.

02:38:33.640 --> 02:38:36.320
I fucking bet we do.

02:38:36.320 --> 02:38:37.320
If you do, God bless you.

02:38:37.320 --> 02:38:38.320
I don't care.

02:38:38.320 --> 02:38:41.840
I don't think there's anything intrinsically negative about religion.

02:38:41.840 --> 02:38:45.840
I think it can bring a lot to your life.

02:38:45.840 --> 02:38:47.640
No comment.

02:38:47.640 --> 02:38:54.680
So this next clip, Alex Jones has been on his bullshit for about, bleh, ever.

02:38:54.680 --> 02:38:57.080
About these liberals want to kill cops.

02:38:57.080 --> 02:38:58.080
Yes.

02:38:58.080 --> 02:38:59.080
Oh, God.

02:38:59.080 --> 02:39:00.080
I don't want to get into the cop narrative.

02:39:00.080 --> 02:39:01.080
No, this one's fun.

02:39:01.080 --> 02:39:02.080
Okay.

02:39:02.080 --> 02:39:07.640
He has an interview with this guy named James Wesley Rawls, who runs a site...

02:39:07.640 --> 02:39:08.640
That's a great name.

02:39:08.640 --> 02:39:09.640
It's not bad.

02:39:09.640 --> 02:39:10.640
That's a great name.

02:39:10.640 --> 02:39:11.640
Good for a serial killer, got three names.

02:39:11.640 --> 02:39:12.640
Absolutely.

02:39:12.640 --> 02:39:13.640
Oh, yeah.

02:39:13.640 --> 02:39:14.640
He runs...

02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:15.920
I would totally be serial killed by that guy.

02:39:15.920 --> 02:39:22.360
He runs a website called survivalblog.com, where he tells you how to survive serial killers.

02:39:22.360 --> 02:39:23.360
Like the globalists.

02:39:23.360 --> 02:39:26.040
He tells you how to survive his own serial killings.

02:39:26.040 --> 02:39:27.520
I think it's a lot of prepping stuff.

02:39:27.520 --> 02:39:31.160
If you don't want to be murdered by me, here's a step-by-step list of instructions.

02:39:31.160 --> 02:39:32.160
Piss me off.

02:39:32.160 --> 02:39:33.160
Piss me off.

02:39:33.160 --> 02:39:34.160
That's it.

02:39:34.160 --> 02:39:35.160
That's the whole blog.

02:39:35.160 --> 02:39:38.160
He is a guy who used to come on on Skype.

02:39:38.160 --> 02:39:40.080
I'm basing this on what Alex has told us.

02:39:40.080 --> 02:39:41.080
Okay.

02:39:41.080 --> 02:39:42.080
He used to come on on Skype.

02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:44.920
Now you don't even want your picture out there because you're so freaked out.

02:39:44.920 --> 02:39:45.920
Too much.

02:39:45.920 --> 02:39:46.920
Weirdo.

02:39:46.920 --> 02:39:47.920
Gotcha.

02:39:47.920 --> 02:39:49.920
So most of the show is an interview with this guy.

02:39:49.920 --> 02:39:56.620
They get into talking about cop killing rhetoric and what have you, and here's that clip.

02:39:56.620 --> 02:39:57.620
It's a paradox.

02:39:57.620 --> 02:39:59.320
They're awake, but they still follow orders.

02:39:59.320 --> 02:40:00.740
The citizens are awake.

02:40:00.740 --> 02:40:02.520
We still put up with it.

02:40:02.520 --> 02:40:07.800
Meanwhile, leftists are out killing police, so they're so fired up once we demonstrate

02:40:07.800 --> 02:40:09.240
they'll attack us.

02:40:09.240 --> 02:40:14.360
I wish there was some sophistication out there that everyone not be played like fiddles.

02:40:14.360 --> 02:40:15.360
Right.

02:40:15.360 --> 02:40:23.180
Well, right now we have a lot of people being played like puppets, indeed, where radicals

02:40:23.180 --> 02:40:31.780
are being pushed toward killing police officers, for example, where, you know, there wasn't

02:40:31.780 --> 02:40:36.360
even talk of that for about a twenty-five period in this country.

02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:40.880
You have to go all the way back to late 1960s or early 70s with the Black Panther movement

02:40:40.880 --> 02:40:45.680
to see, you know, at the time they referred to it as the kill the killers movement.

02:40:45.680 --> 02:40:46.680
Fucking anybody.

02:40:46.680 --> 02:40:52.320
That kind of went quiet for a long, long time in this nation.

02:40:52.320 --> 02:40:55.560
And seeing that reemerge is very troubling.

02:40:55.560 --> 02:40:56.560
That's very troubling.

02:40:56.560 --> 02:40:57.560
What's more troubling?

02:40:57.560 --> 02:41:02.960
Fucking listen to anybody who's not fucking white!

02:41:02.960 --> 02:41:06.360
N.W.A. had fuck the police in 1988.

02:41:06.360 --> 02:41:07.640
What does this do?

02:41:07.640 --> 02:41:10.920
Body count had cop killer in 1992.

02:41:10.920 --> 02:41:13.940
How many times does this happen?

02:41:13.940 --> 02:41:16.120
This happens to so many white people.

02:41:16.120 --> 02:41:17.440
9-1-1 is a joke.

02:41:17.440 --> 02:41:18.440
Came out in 1990.

02:41:18.440 --> 02:41:20.680
Granted, that wasn't cop killing, but that was...

02:41:20.680 --> 02:41:25.920
So many white people always come with, uh, I've never heard this shit before.

02:41:25.920 --> 02:41:28.480
When did they start talking about this?

02:41:28.480 --> 02:41:31.600
Like fucking everybody, always!

02:41:31.600 --> 02:41:37.040
I think that's really, like, when we talk about feminism and racism and these sorts

02:41:37.040 --> 02:41:42.880
of things and how blind Alex is to so many things and how reactionary he is, a lot of

02:41:42.880 --> 02:41:47.640
it really does boil down in some ways to, like, you're not listening.

02:41:47.640 --> 02:41:49.640
You're not listening.

02:41:49.640 --> 02:41:56.720
And maybe the larger avenue there is just that nobody was, nobody in your world was

02:41:56.720 --> 02:41:57.720
talking about it.

02:41:57.720 --> 02:41:58.720
Yeah, and no one...

02:41:58.720 --> 02:42:02.600
Because that was, that was the thing, like, if you go back to the 80s with N.W.A., you

02:42:02.600 --> 02:42:08.040
see all those local news spots going, like, is rap out of control?

02:42:08.040 --> 02:42:14.000
Like all of those different things, and never are black people being murdered by the cops!

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:19.480
Now let's take, like, reality out of it and sensible discourse out of it.

02:42:19.480 --> 02:42:21.200
Let's just remove that for a second.

02:42:21.200 --> 02:42:23.280
Which is the entire focus of this podcast.

02:42:23.280 --> 02:42:27.880
Think about how many people were fucking talking about taking out the police after the Rodney

02:42:27.880 --> 02:42:28.880
King stuff.

02:42:28.880 --> 02:42:29.880
Oh my god.

02:42:29.880 --> 02:42:30.880
And that was not in the 60s.

02:42:30.880 --> 02:42:31.880
No.

02:42:31.880 --> 02:42:32.880
No, no, no, no.

02:42:32.880 --> 02:42:40.040
So, I mean, like, even that is just a very clear example of fucking James Wesley Rawls

02:42:40.040 --> 02:42:41.040
is an idiot.

02:42:41.040 --> 02:42:42.040
Yeah.

02:42:42.040 --> 02:42:43.880
He is a fucking ahistorical idiot.

02:42:43.880 --> 02:42:44.880
Right.

02:42:44.880 --> 02:42:48.560
But, hey, you know what, he's got a blog.

02:42:48.560 --> 02:42:49.560
That's pretty cool.

02:42:49.560 --> 02:42:50.920
God damn it.

02:42:50.920 --> 02:42:56.260
So James Wesley Rawls is a nutty kind of dude.

02:42:56.260 --> 02:43:02.240
One of his basic arguments that he's making within this interview is that the globalists

02:43:02.240 --> 02:43:06.000
created radical Islam in order to fight against them.

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:07.000
Logical.

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.880
Like, they're fighting against the West, because they needed a better enemy.

02:43:09.880 --> 02:43:10.880
Controlled opposition.

02:43:10.880 --> 02:43:11.880
Yeah.

02:43:11.880 --> 02:43:12.880
They needed, like, a-

02:43:12.880 --> 02:43:14.240
We had the Nazis, now we gotta get Islam.

02:43:14.240 --> 02:43:19.080
They need a scary enemy that they can fight against, and in that way curtail our freedoms

02:43:19.080 --> 02:43:24.520
and then create a one-world religion that is partially Islamic, and a one-world government.

02:43:24.520 --> 02:43:25.520
Sure.

02:43:25.520 --> 02:43:26.520
It's nonsense.

02:43:26.520 --> 02:43:31.920
But again, it doubles back into this shit that Alex talks about, where you're radicalizing

02:43:31.920 --> 02:43:36.960
the enemy that you are imagining in order to justify your radical nature.

02:43:36.960 --> 02:43:37.960
Yeah.

02:43:37.960 --> 02:43:41.020
There's a ton of that in his discourse.

02:43:41.020 --> 02:43:44.080
And this is the fucking money bomb.

02:43:44.080 --> 02:43:45.080
Most of the show.

02:43:45.080 --> 02:43:46.080
That's right.

02:43:46.080 --> 02:43:47.080
This is the money bomb we're into.

02:43:47.080 --> 02:43:48.080
Most of the show-

02:43:48.080 --> 02:43:49.080
It's fear.

02:43:49.080 --> 02:43:50.080
It's fear.

02:43:50.080 --> 02:43:51.080
Yes.

02:43:51.080 --> 02:43:52.080
Yeah.

02:43:52.080 --> 02:43:53.080
Fear and-

02:43:53.080 --> 02:43:54.080
The money bomb is fear.

02:43:54.080 --> 02:43:56.000
Fear and we are much more numerous than you think.

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:57.160
You are not alone.

02:43:57.160 --> 02:43:58.160
It's all of us.

02:43:58.160 --> 02:44:00.680
There's 3.5 billion of us.

02:44:00.680 --> 02:44:01.680
Don't feel bad.

02:44:01.680 --> 02:44:06.780
Don't eat to us, because you're just one of- it's like when a busker has a dollar bill

02:44:06.780 --> 02:44:09.440
already in his hat whenever he pulls it out.

02:44:09.440 --> 02:44:10.680
You're priming the pot.

02:44:10.680 --> 02:44:11.680
Exactly.

02:44:11.680 --> 02:44:13.000
You're making sure that people know it's okay.

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:17.800
Yeah, there's 3.5 billion people behind you, but just fucking support us because we're

02:44:17.800 --> 02:44:22.040
the only ones fighting these fake globalists.

02:44:22.040 --> 02:44:24.440
Before Rawls gets out-

02:44:24.440 --> 02:44:30.520
Can you imagine how much money he would have if he actually reached three and a half billion

02:44:30.520 --> 02:44:31.520
people?

02:44:31.520 --> 02:44:34.520
Well, if everyone gave him a quarter.

02:44:34.520 --> 02:44:35.520
Yeah.

02:44:35.520 --> 02:44:36.520
Yeah.

02:44:36.520 --> 02:44:37.520
Oh, man.

02:44:37.520 --> 02:44:43.560
We're considering the insane markup he has on these products, even when they're on sale,

02:44:43.560 --> 02:44:47.560
which I didn't even mean to bring up, but let's fucking talk about it.

02:44:47.560 --> 02:44:48.560
Okay.

02:44:48.560 --> 02:44:49.560
Let's get into it.

02:44:49.560 --> 02:44:52.680
During the money bomb, unprecedented sales-

02:44:52.680 --> 02:44:54.000
Is it like an Easter sale?

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:55.000
Yeah, he's constantly-

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:56.000
30% off?

02:44:56.000 --> 02:45:01.040
He's constantly talking about like, all right, got the brain force, that's on sale until

02:45:01.040 --> 02:45:03.840
the show is over, got free shipping on everything.

02:45:03.840 --> 02:45:04.840
Infomercial style.

02:45:04.840 --> 02:45:10.020
He's basically talking about things being at cost, just like, got to move it, that sort

02:45:10.020 --> 02:45:11.020
of thing.

02:45:11.020 --> 02:45:12.020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:45:12.020 --> 02:45:15.320
He's like, hey, this is a loss leader, everyone's going to come in and make money on it, which

02:45:15.320 --> 02:45:16.320
is bullshit.

02:45:16.320 --> 02:45:17.320
I mean, well-

02:45:17.320 --> 02:45:18.320
He's pretending.

02:45:18.320 --> 02:45:22.880
If you are looking at the end of the fiscal year though, just because you're-

02:45:22.880 --> 02:45:24.040
You got to get that product out of there.

02:45:24.040 --> 02:45:25.040
If you're selling it, it's revenue.

02:45:25.040 --> 02:45:26.040
Because otherwise, yeah.

02:45:26.040 --> 02:45:27.040
Otherwise-

02:45:27.040 --> 02:45:31.440
It doesn't matter if you're making a profit on it or not, it's still money you have.

02:45:31.440 --> 02:45:35.320
And it's not like that stuff you bought isn't going to factor into the end of the fiscal

02:45:35.320 --> 02:45:36.320
year.

02:45:36.320 --> 02:45:37.320
Of course, of course.

02:45:37.320 --> 02:45:39.920
You're balancing the books in some ways, even if you sell it for no profit.

02:45:39.920 --> 02:45:40.920
Yeah.

02:45:40.920 --> 02:45:41.920
Which might-

02:45:41.920 --> 02:45:42.920
I don't know when we got into business.

02:45:42.920 --> 02:45:43.920
I don't know when this happened.

02:45:43.920 --> 02:45:44.920
I'm an accountant.

02:45:44.920 --> 02:45:45.920
Oh, that's right.

02:45:45.920 --> 02:45:46.920
You are an accountant.

02:45:46.920 --> 02:45:47.920
But it might still be like-

02:45:47.920 --> 02:45:49.200
I'm just an interested party.

02:45:49.200 --> 02:45:57.120
It might be indicative of the fact that he may be overbought and is in a hole, or just

02:45:57.120 --> 02:45:58.200
is in a hole generally.

02:45:58.200 --> 02:45:59.200
I don't know.

02:45:59.200 --> 02:46:00.200
Anyway.

02:46:00.200 --> 02:46:06.760
But Rawls, before he gets out of the episode, has to say one of the scariest things I've

02:46:06.760 --> 02:46:08.840
heard a guest say on Alex Jones' show.

02:46:08.840 --> 02:46:09.840
Oh boy.

02:46:09.840 --> 02:46:10.840
Here we go.

02:46:10.840 --> 02:46:15.920
There's going to be huge numbers of Christian refugees in the coming decades.

02:46:15.920 --> 02:46:23.880
And I believe that there is actually a need for a new homeland nation for persecuted Christian

02:46:23.880 --> 02:46:29.680
and messianic Jewish refugees who are going to be pushed out of countries in huge numbers

02:46:29.680 --> 02:46:30.680
in the years to come.

02:46:30.680 --> 02:46:36.600
And that's why I decided to write my Counter-Caliphate Chronicles series.

02:46:36.600 --> 02:46:41.800
That first novel called Land of Promise describes the establishment of a Christian homeland

02:46:41.800 --> 02:46:43.120
nation.

02:46:43.120 --> 02:46:48.520
And I also made it fictionally a Christian libertarian nation to illustrate a lot of

02:46:48.520 --> 02:46:49.560
other points.

02:46:49.560 --> 02:46:52.280
But I do think that that is needed.

02:46:52.280 --> 02:46:59.560
And we need to pray that God would provide a safe haven for persecuted Christians all

02:46:59.560 --> 02:47:00.560
over the world.

02:47:00.560 --> 02:47:05.240
I would argue that most of the time, when religiously specific countries have been created,

02:47:05.240 --> 02:47:08.240
it hasn't gone great.

02:47:08.240 --> 02:47:13.760
The thing I hear there, though, is that he's saying, so many Christian refugees, we need

02:47:13.760 --> 02:47:18.920
a homeland nation, and we're creating a counter-caliphate.

02:47:18.920 --> 02:47:19.920
Which is like, wait.

02:47:19.920 --> 02:47:23.560
Counter-Caliphate is the name of his novel series that he's written.

02:47:23.560 --> 02:47:30.420
But the point being, we hate this thing that is persecuting us, so let's make exactly that

02:47:30.420 --> 02:47:31.420
thing.

02:47:31.420 --> 02:47:32.420
But our version.

02:47:32.420 --> 02:47:33.420
But our version.

02:47:33.420 --> 02:47:34.420
Yeah.

02:47:34.420 --> 02:47:35.420
That's insane to me.

02:47:35.420 --> 02:47:37.440
That mentality pervades Alex Jones's guests.

02:47:37.440 --> 02:47:38.440
Well, that's a good point.

02:47:38.440 --> 02:47:40.120
I don't understand why you're shocked by that.

02:47:40.120 --> 02:47:45.960
I know, but it just, well, and frankly, this is what we've been talking about for months

02:47:45.960 --> 02:47:46.960
now.

02:47:46.960 --> 02:47:47.960
Yeah, basically forever.

02:47:47.960 --> 02:47:55.000
And it never fails to surprise me that people don't stop for one fucking second and think,

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:58.800
oh, well, this thing is bad, so let's not do this thing.

02:47:58.800 --> 02:48:02.240
Well, because they have this...

02:48:02.240 --> 02:48:04.080
But then again, then again, you know what?

02:48:04.080 --> 02:48:12.360
At the same point, every Democrat said, you know, when they go low, we go high.

02:48:12.360 --> 02:48:13.360
Not every Democrat.

02:48:13.360 --> 02:48:14.360
Well, no, not every Democrat.

02:48:14.360 --> 02:48:20.640
But Marty DeRosa, fucking policy wonk and friend of the show, he and I were having this

02:48:20.640 --> 02:48:25.920
conversation where it's like, we all said when they go low, we go high, and now we're

02:48:25.920 --> 02:48:31.560
kind of at the position where it's like, oh, when they go low, you fucking go goddamn lower.

02:48:31.560 --> 02:48:33.400
Fucking get into there.

02:48:33.400 --> 02:48:34.400
So I don't know.

02:48:34.400 --> 02:48:35.400
I don't know, man.

02:48:35.400 --> 02:48:36.400
When they go low, chop block.

02:48:36.400 --> 02:48:37.400
Right?

02:48:37.400 --> 02:48:38.400
I don't know.

02:48:38.400 --> 02:48:41.320
Don't punch somebody when they've taken out your knees, like, I don't know.

02:48:41.320 --> 02:48:45.280
It's not in any way justifying the idea of like, we need our own Christian...

02:48:45.280 --> 02:48:46.280
No, pogroms.

02:48:46.280 --> 02:48:47.280
Pogroms.

02:48:47.280 --> 02:48:48.280
Okay.

02:48:48.280 --> 02:48:53.800
So the rest of Alex Jones' September 16th show for the money bomb.

02:48:53.800 --> 02:48:56.120
Before we go any further, I do think he's right.

02:48:56.120 --> 02:49:01.240
There will be a lot of Christian refugees in the same way that there will be a lot of

02:49:01.240 --> 02:49:02.520
refugees total.

02:49:02.520 --> 02:49:03.520
Period.

02:49:03.520 --> 02:49:08.400
Immediately following, like, considering the effects of climate change, what does happen

02:49:08.400 --> 02:49:10.920
in our country in specific, right?

02:49:10.920 --> 02:49:17.000
So right now, we have a shit ton of Muslim refugees from all of these places.

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.120
And but not entirely.

02:49:19.120 --> 02:49:20.120
But not entirely.

02:49:20.120 --> 02:49:21.440
It's not all Muslims.

02:49:21.440 --> 02:49:25.600
But my point is that so many people are up in arms about this.

02:49:25.600 --> 02:49:30.720
When we just start talking about refugees with no religion in front of it, think about

02:49:30.720 --> 02:49:33.840
how many Christian refugees and how many all of these things...

02:49:33.840 --> 02:49:38.160
Everyone's going to scapegoat depending on the adjective that is part of the refugee

02:49:38.160 --> 02:49:39.160
part thing.

02:49:39.160 --> 02:49:40.160
Exactly.

02:49:40.160 --> 02:49:41.160
How many refugees...

02:49:41.160 --> 02:49:42.480
How many Christian refugees?

02:49:42.480 --> 02:49:47.360
What's the number before people start saying, well, we don't want any more refugees total?

02:49:47.360 --> 02:49:53.680
It's the fun part of complaining about refugees stuff because like, hey, they're gonna be

02:49:53.680 --> 02:49:55.880
Christians while you deny climate change.

02:49:55.880 --> 02:49:56.880
Exactly.

02:49:56.880 --> 02:49:57.880
It's a fun game to play.

02:49:57.880 --> 02:49:58.880
Like, this is going to happen.

02:49:58.880 --> 02:50:00.760
It's a fun, fun game.

02:50:00.760 --> 02:50:02.360
What's the number, though?

02:50:02.360 --> 02:50:04.400
Like how many...

02:50:04.400 --> 02:50:08.760
For fuck's sakes, imagine we're talking about Rome.

02:50:08.760 --> 02:50:14.200
All of the Catholics, for whatever reason, need to move.

02:50:14.200 --> 02:50:19.280
How many people in the United States before it starts going like, well, we can't allow

02:50:19.280 --> 02:50:20.960
any refugees in?

02:50:20.960 --> 02:50:24.080
Regardless of religion, we just can't allow refugees in.

02:50:24.080 --> 02:50:28.880
But let's even imagine a scenario wherein, and this may not be the case, I'm not saying

02:50:28.880 --> 02:50:35.660
it necessarily is, but let's imagine a scenario where it just so happens that Muslim dominated

02:50:35.660 --> 02:50:40.500
countries happen to be the places that are safer from climate change.

02:50:40.500 --> 02:50:41.500
Let's imagine that.

02:50:41.500 --> 02:50:42.500
Right, right, right, right.

02:50:42.500 --> 02:50:47.220
So let's imagine like Saudi Arabia is a place that is unaffected by climate change.

02:50:47.220 --> 02:50:49.200
And now these Catholics that are displaced from...

02:50:49.200 --> 02:50:51.760
Because it's a fucking desert, so...

02:50:51.760 --> 02:50:52.760
And now it's wonderful.

02:50:52.760 --> 02:50:55.220
Yeah, now it's a fucking utopia.

02:50:55.220 --> 02:51:01.560
So let's imagine that these Catholics from the south of Italy, where it's flooded to

02:51:01.560 --> 02:51:03.440
shit, now have to find a place...

02:51:03.440 --> 02:51:04.640
Venice is fucking gone.

02:51:04.640 --> 02:51:05.640
Done.

02:51:05.640 --> 02:51:11.480
Now they have to go somewhere, and they go into Saudi Arabia, and Saudi Arabia, I mean,

02:51:11.480 --> 02:51:15.200
let's not unpack all of their negative cultural problems.

02:51:15.200 --> 02:51:17.000
Let's just talk about people coming in.

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:23.240
Let's say that they have a way of life, and these Catholics come in and want to change

02:51:23.240 --> 02:51:24.240
everything.

02:51:24.240 --> 02:51:25.240
Yeah.

02:51:25.240 --> 02:51:26.240
Ugh.

02:51:26.240 --> 02:51:27.240
Ugh.

02:51:27.240 --> 02:51:30.680
How is it that people can't do that next step thought?

02:51:30.680 --> 02:51:31.680
I don't know.

02:51:31.680 --> 02:51:33.280
Like think about that reciprocity.

02:51:33.280 --> 02:51:35.240
I think people are too caught up in their identity.

02:51:35.240 --> 02:51:36.920
Yeah, that's probably true.

02:51:36.920 --> 02:51:41.280
That's why whenever we talk about Alex Jones, I don't like to call him a white supremacist.

02:51:41.280 --> 02:51:44.600
I like to say that he's caught up in white identity.

02:51:44.600 --> 02:51:46.600
White Christian male identity.

02:51:46.600 --> 02:51:50.800
Because that I think is more to the point than saying he's a white supremacist.

02:51:50.800 --> 02:51:54.800
It's way too easy to say that he thinks he's better than everybody, because of course he

02:51:54.800 --> 02:51:55.800
does.

02:51:55.800 --> 02:52:02.400
But what really motivates him is his identification with what makes him white, what makes him

02:52:02.400 --> 02:52:05.040
male, what makes him Christian.

02:52:05.040 --> 02:52:11.200
And I think that it's too threatening to a lot of people to imagine a world wherein that

02:52:11.200 --> 02:52:13.600
identity is problematic to other people.

02:52:13.600 --> 02:52:14.600
Yeah.

02:52:14.600 --> 02:52:15.600
Yeah.

02:52:15.600 --> 02:52:16.600
Because it becomes threatening.

02:52:16.600 --> 02:52:18.000
That's the whole fight, right?

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:22.800
Like that's their whole argument is that because the demographics are changing, all of a sudden

02:52:22.800 --> 02:52:28.360
they have the thought of, wait, maybe they start thinking what we think about them about

02:52:28.360 --> 02:52:29.360
us.

02:52:29.360 --> 02:52:37.000
I mean, I read a really interesting assessment of someone was pointing out that a lot of

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:47.080
homophobia is based on a fear by really aggressive, angry dudes that men will treat them like

02:52:47.080 --> 02:52:49.520
they treat women.

02:52:49.520 --> 02:52:52.120
And I think that there is a bit of that in...

02:52:52.120 --> 02:52:53.520
That's a really good thought.

02:52:53.520 --> 02:52:58.200
I think there's a lot of that in tons of this stuff.

02:52:58.200 --> 02:53:03.480
Marx is afraid that minorities will treat him how he thinks about them.

02:53:03.480 --> 02:53:04.480
It's reciprocity.

02:53:04.480 --> 02:53:05.480
Yeah.

02:53:05.480 --> 02:53:08.880
That's what they're really afraid of, all of their crimes coming back against them.

02:53:08.880 --> 02:53:09.880
Right.

02:53:09.880 --> 02:53:11.880
They're afraid of karma.

02:53:11.880 --> 02:53:12.880
In many ways.

02:53:12.880 --> 02:53:13.880
Yeah.

02:53:13.880 --> 02:53:15.520
So the rest of the...

02:53:15.520 --> 02:53:20.160
That's just the thing that I have always considered.

02:53:20.160 --> 02:53:26.260
And it is one of those things in the later stages of Obama's presidency that I was concerned

02:53:26.260 --> 02:53:32.480
about is because of that executive overreach, because of how much power we gave Obama, Trump

02:53:32.480 --> 02:53:34.320
now has that power.

02:53:34.320 --> 02:53:35.420
Like they just never...

02:53:35.420 --> 02:53:38.560
We just never considered that it could be used against us.

02:53:38.560 --> 02:53:40.160
That's not true.

02:53:40.160 --> 02:53:41.160
In the...

02:53:41.160 --> 02:53:45.580
I mean, I agree with the point, but when that was happening, when that executive power was

02:53:45.580 --> 02:53:51.920
given to Obama, there were people such as myself and other folks, yeah, you as well,

02:53:51.920 --> 02:53:54.480
who were like, this is not good.

02:53:54.480 --> 02:54:00.960
There should not be like, and it goes back to Bush, the idea of being able to unilaterally

02:54:00.960 --> 02:54:02.320
launch wars.

02:54:02.320 --> 02:54:04.600
That sort of thing is not in the power of the executive.

02:54:04.600 --> 02:54:06.840
The executive branch became way too strong.

02:54:06.840 --> 02:54:13.480
And even with Obama in power, I know tons of Democrats and liberal-minded people who

02:54:13.480 --> 02:54:15.200
are super against that.

02:54:15.200 --> 02:54:16.440
And it wasn't enough.

02:54:16.440 --> 02:54:24.040
It wasn't enough to sway the Congress, sway the actual people who made decisions.

02:54:24.040 --> 02:54:25.040
Imagine...

02:54:25.040 --> 02:54:29.280
Yeah, no, I'm out.

02:54:29.280 --> 02:54:30.280
It just becomes...

02:54:30.280 --> 02:54:31.280
I'm out.

02:54:31.280 --> 02:54:32.280
That's insane.

02:54:32.280 --> 02:54:33.280
It's insane.

02:54:33.280 --> 02:54:35.400
It's political opportunism by the...

02:54:35.400 --> 02:54:40.240
I mean, if we keep this conversation going more than 10 minutes, we're going to say,

02:54:40.240 --> 02:54:41.240
let's overthrow everything.

02:54:41.240 --> 02:54:42.240
Because I think...

02:54:42.240 --> 02:54:48.120
This whole thing has been me just pushing you closer to my side.

02:54:48.120 --> 02:54:50.840
Little do you know, I'm already there, but...

02:54:50.840 --> 02:54:51.840
Don't reveal that.

02:54:51.840 --> 02:54:52.840
Don't reveal that.

02:54:52.840 --> 02:54:53.840
You're our cover.

02:54:53.840 --> 02:54:54.840
You're our cover.

02:54:54.840 --> 02:54:55.840
You're our cover.

02:54:55.840 --> 02:54:56.840
So, September 16th...

02:54:56.840 --> 02:54:57.840
I'm the revolution.

02:54:57.840 --> 02:54:59.840
You're the one who's keeping us legitimate.

02:54:59.840 --> 02:55:01.000
Part one of the Money Bomb.

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:04.160
It ends with a long interview with Dr. Group.

02:55:04.160 --> 02:55:09.680
Dr. Group runs the fourth hour of the show before they hand it off to whoever dumbass...

02:55:09.680 --> 02:55:11.160
Maybe Joe Biggs, I'm not entirely sure.

02:55:11.160 --> 02:55:12.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:55:12.160 --> 02:55:13.160
Who cares?

02:55:13.160 --> 02:55:14.160
Yeah.

02:55:14.160 --> 02:55:15.160
They keep the marathon going.

02:55:15.160 --> 02:55:16.160
He's just trying to sell a lot of products.

02:55:16.160 --> 02:55:17.160
He does a bunch of bullshit.

02:55:17.160 --> 02:55:22.840
But before he leaves, before Alex leaves, he says that his predictions have never been

02:55:22.840 --> 02:55:29.560
wrong, he's basically a psychic, and that his sixth sense is on fire like never before.

02:55:29.560 --> 02:55:30.560
Race memory.

02:55:30.560 --> 02:55:31.560
That's a quote.

02:55:31.560 --> 02:55:33.840
My sixth sense is on fire like it's never been before.

02:55:33.840 --> 02:55:36.840
First of all, I don't think you have a sixth sense.

02:55:36.840 --> 02:55:37.840
Don't care.

02:55:37.840 --> 02:55:41.440
I think that you are freaked out, certainly.

02:55:41.440 --> 02:55:46.120
Then he had this quote that I thought was really fucking awesome, and it was, if you're

02:55:46.120 --> 02:55:50.240
nouveau riche and you're not giving us money, or...

02:55:50.240 --> 02:55:54.140
And then there's a long list of things basically that are just about giving him press, like

02:55:54.140 --> 02:55:56.880
buying us a billboard, that sort of thing.

02:55:56.880 --> 02:55:59.060
You're crazy.

02:55:59.060 --> 02:56:03.200
If you're nouveau riche, is that the way he phrases it, like alright.

02:56:03.200 --> 02:56:06.040
Because he wants to delineate between people who have money...

02:56:06.040 --> 02:56:07.040
It's not old money.

02:56:07.040 --> 02:56:08.040
It's not old money.

02:56:08.040 --> 02:56:12.780
It's the new, it's the dot-com billionaires who he's really courting.

02:56:12.780 --> 02:56:16.500
So now, here's where things get really fun.

02:56:16.500 --> 02:56:17.500
Where is that?

02:56:17.500 --> 02:56:25.240
Larry Jones did his show on September 16th, then he was due to come back from 10-11pm

02:56:25.240 --> 02:56:27.800
to do an interview with Larry Nichols.

02:56:27.800 --> 02:56:34.640
They were going to do an hour-long interview, and then they were going to premiere a documentary.

02:56:34.640 --> 02:56:40.240
He sent people down to tape Larry Nichols at his house, whose address has been given

02:56:40.240 --> 02:56:43.040
out on our show.

02:56:43.040 --> 02:56:45.400
And his phone number, if you'd like to call him, please.

02:56:45.400 --> 02:56:46.740
I think we blocked that out.

02:56:46.740 --> 02:56:52.120
He's emailknowledgefight.com, and I will fucking give you his phone number, I don't give a

02:56:52.120 --> 02:56:53.120
shit.

02:56:53.120 --> 02:56:54.120
He gave it out on air!

02:56:54.120 --> 02:56:55.120
He did.

02:56:55.120 --> 02:56:56.120
And it's still on the internet.

02:56:56.120 --> 02:56:57.960
On Alex Jones' channel.

02:56:57.960 --> 02:57:02.280
But be that as it may, they sent them out there, they made a documentary, and Alex was

02:57:02.280 --> 02:57:08.280
going to do an hour-long interview with Larry to, like, precede it.

02:57:08.280 --> 02:57:11.940
Larry clearly didn't answer the phone.

02:57:11.940 --> 02:57:12.940
Because the first half...

02:57:12.940 --> 02:57:13.940
On purpose?

02:57:13.940 --> 02:57:14.940
I think he was asleep.

02:57:14.940 --> 02:57:19.760
The first half hour of the show is Alex Jones vamping like hell.

02:57:19.760 --> 02:57:23.960
He's just talking about, like, my early days on radio were great.

02:57:23.960 --> 02:57:28.280
It's just, like, it's so much filler for, like, the first 25 minutes of the hour.

02:57:28.280 --> 02:57:29.720
There are two kinds of people.

02:57:29.720 --> 02:57:32.600
People on the radio, and then people not on the radio.

02:57:32.600 --> 02:57:37.320
What he's trying to do is he's trying to say things without getting into anything that

02:57:37.320 --> 02:57:40.840
he can't bail from if Larry gets on the phone at any point.

02:57:40.840 --> 02:57:41.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:57:41.840 --> 02:57:45.240
And then that, like, that maintenance, like, let's, uh...

02:57:45.240 --> 02:57:46.240
Yeah.

02:57:46.240 --> 02:57:47.240
He's stretching.

02:57:47.240 --> 02:57:48.240
Yeah, exactly.

02:57:48.240 --> 02:57:53.920
And so about 25 minutes or so, 30 minutes in, Larry Nichols finally gets on the phone,

02:57:53.920 --> 02:57:58.860
and they just talk about how much Hillary sucks, of course, because that's his bread

02:57:58.860 --> 02:57:59.860
and butter.

02:57:59.860 --> 02:58:04.720
And Larry Nichols drops this chestnut.

02:58:04.720 --> 02:58:10.440
What Hillary needs to do, and what she's going to do, is she's going to make herself the

02:58:10.440 --> 02:58:11.920
underdog.

02:58:11.920 --> 02:58:17.680
That's why she released all this information about the servers.

02:58:17.680 --> 02:58:18.680
Wait.

02:58:18.680 --> 02:58:24.160
Hillary released her own, the information about the servers herself?

02:58:24.160 --> 02:58:28.600
Yes, yes, because she needs to make herself the underdog, which is out of Larry Nichols'

02:58:28.600 --> 02:58:32.760
playbook from way back in the Arkansas days.

02:58:32.760 --> 02:58:36.040
They had to make Bill Clinton an underdog in order to make, because everyone loves an

02:58:36.040 --> 02:58:37.040
underdog.

02:58:37.040 --> 02:58:38.920
But Bill Clinton was the underdog.

02:58:38.920 --> 02:58:39.920
Right.

02:58:39.920 --> 02:58:40.920
That's nonsense.

02:58:40.920 --> 02:58:41.920
Okay.

02:58:41.920 --> 02:58:45.520
It's all, and if you actually look at Larry Nichols' actual history with the Clintons,

02:58:45.520 --> 02:58:46.520
it doesn't...

02:58:46.520 --> 02:58:48.760
No, that doesn't scan at all.

02:58:48.760 --> 02:58:52.000
He wasn't involved with any of the stuff he says he was involved with.

02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:53.000
No.

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:58.000
So that's his big sort of selling point, is that she did all this shit to herself, because

02:58:58.000 --> 02:59:00.640
the Clintons and the Bushes are dynastic families.

02:59:00.640 --> 02:59:03.980
They're always going to be at the top, so they have to make themselves the underdogs

02:59:03.980 --> 02:59:06.480
in order for you to kind of care about them.

02:59:06.480 --> 02:59:14.180
So he goes on to say, these next two things on the show that are dumb...

02:59:14.180 --> 02:59:18.160
They only have 20 minutes or so to do their interview before they scream at you.

02:59:18.160 --> 02:59:20.520
Yeah, because they've already bailed on so many hours.

02:59:20.520 --> 02:59:26.700
And they spend 10 minutes of it with Alex Jones vamping more, because Larry Nichols

02:59:26.700 --> 02:59:28.400
has to take his dog out to shit.

02:59:28.400 --> 02:59:29.400
Oh!

02:59:29.400 --> 02:59:30.400
It's crazy.

02:59:30.400 --> 02:59:31.400
That's cute.

02:59:31.400 --> 02:59:34.560
It's humanizing in some ways, but it's terrible radio.

02:59:34.560 --> 02:59:35.560
It's terrible.

02:59:35.560 --> 02:59:36.960
And Hitler's dog loved him.

02:59:36.960 --> 02:59:37.960
Yeah.

02:59:37.960 --> 02:59:41.960
But here is something that Larry Nichols predicts about Hillary that did not come true.

02:59:41.960 --> 02:59:43.800
You said that first months ago.

02:59:43.800 --> 02:59:49.040
Now it's in the news that Obama's after Hillary, and she's even attacking Obama now.

02:59:49.040 --> 02:59:52.360
Yeah, here's what you will watch.

02:59:52.360 --> 02:59:54.100
Here's what's coming.

02:59:54.100 --> 02:59:58.600
They're following our playbook this time exactly, Alex.

02:59:58.600 --> 03:00:00.920
She's going to start the tearing to her.

03:00:00.920 --> 03:00:04.520
Now when Hillary goes out, she's going to tear up.

03:00:04.520 --> 03:00:06.440
So that's misogynistic as fuck.

03:00:06.440 --> 03:00:09.480
Now when Hillary goes out, she's going to tear up.

03:00:09.480 --> 03:00:10.480
She's going to start crying.

03:00:10.480 --> 03:00:13.800
She's going to start crying, because everybody respects a woman who cries.

03:00:13.800 --> 03:00:14.800
Sure.

03:00:14.800 --> 03:00:17.360
Everybody's going to be like, oh, this woman cries?

03:00:17.360 --> 03:00:19.460
That makes me want her to be president.

03:00:19.460 --> 03:00:25.280
There's no inherent misogyny behind a woman crying that, oh, fuck off.

03:00:25.280 --> 03:00:26.740
Fuck you, Larry Nichols.

03:00:26.740 --> 03:00:30.740
In the same way that Alex always complains that like, hey, you call me racist, and that's

03:00:30.740 --> 03:00:32.400
your way of taking my power.

03:00:32.400 --> 03:00:36.920
She believes that a woman starts crying, and now I've got to be chivalrous.

03:00:36.920 --> 03:00:38.360
It's that same thing.

03:00:38.360 --> 03:00:39.720
It's a load of bullshit.

03:00:39.720 --> 03:00:43.660
Also, Hillary Clinton, say what you want about her, did not cry.

03:00:43.660 --> 03:00:47.560
She came out and defended herself quite admirably.

03:00:47.560 --> 03:00:48.560
No.

03:00:48.560 --> 03:00:52.260
So, whatever Larry Nichols' idea.

03:00:52.260 --> 03:00:55.280
Say whatever you want about Hillary's campaign.

03:00:55.280 --> 03:00:56.920
Hillary fucking brought it.

03:00:56.920 --> 03:00:58.200
You've got to give her that.

03:00:58.200 --> 03:01:04.640
And she stood up to these attacks and didn't, I mean, she apologized for things that you

03:01:04.640 --> 03:01:08.120
thought was like maybe an error in judgment, those sorts of things.

03:01:08.120 --> 03:01:10.320
Yeah, the super predator shit.

03:01:10.320 --> 03:01:11.320
Bad.

03:01:11.320 --> 03:01:12.320
Yeah.

03:01:12.320 --> 03:01:18.520
But didn't back down to this right wing conspiracy that mostly tracks back to Larry Nichols.

03:01:18.520 --> 03:01:19.520
Yeah, exactly.

03:01:19.520 --> 03:01:23.200
Like, Larry Nichols legitimately is such a problem in the world.

03:01:23.200 --> 03:01:24.760
He's so terrible.

03:01:24.760 --> 03:01:25.760
Wow.

03:01:25.760 --> 03:01:31.120
And as much as he is a problem in terms of all the stuff he's done with the Clintons,

03:01:31.120 --> 03:01:33.520
he's a huge problem in general.

03:01:33.520 --> 03:01:37.760
Like I know he, we've talked about this, he was saying that Obama wants to become the

03:01:37.760 --> 03:01:41.520
last president, because then he becomes king.

03:01:41.520 --> 03:01:46.280
Like the Patton Oswalt bit about Bush, where he wants to become the last president.

03:01:46.280 --> 03:01:48.160
Right, but he's not doing comedy.

03:01:48.160 --> 03:01:50.760
Yeah, no, he's not very funny about this at all.

03:01:50.760 --> 03:01:55.680
He will become the king, and then once he's the king, yes, he becomes the king of the

03:01:55.680 --> 03:01:56.680
Muslims.

03:01:56.680 --> 03:01:57.680
Yes.

03:01:57.680 --> 03:01:58.680
Now...

03:01:58.680 --> 03:01:59.680
Which will never stop.

03:01:59.680 --> 03:02:00.680
That's funny.

03:02:00.680 --> 03:02:01.680
That will never not make me laugh.

03:02:01.680 --> 03:02:02.680
That's funny.

03:02:02.680 --> 03:02:03.680
The king of the Muslims!

03:02:03.680 --> 03:02:04.680
That's funny.

03:02:04.680 --> 03:02:05.680
Yeah.

03:02:05.680 --> 03:02:11.920
But, listen to this next clip of Larry Nichols, and realize how much he fucking hates Muslims,

03:02:11.920 --> 03:02:13.680
and realize...

03:02:13.680 --> 03:02:15.280
This is Nichols hating...

03:02:15.280 --> 03:02:16.280
Yeah.

03:02:16.280 --> 03:02:17.280
Okay.

03:02:17.280 --> 03:02:18.280
This is no longer funny.

03:02:18.280 --> 03:02:19.280
Alright.

03:02:19.280 --> 03:02:20.280
I just can't believe it.

03:02:20.280 --> 03:02:23.600
I just can't believe what, I mean, what type of psycho scum... you've been around these

03:02:23.600 --> 03:02:26.320
people, but I mean, they weren't even that bad back then.

03:02:26.320 --> 03:02:28.320
Have they gone crazy?

03:02:28.320 --> 03:02:33.520
In my day, bad guys would look good today.

03:02:33.520 --> 03:02:40.160
Bad guys back then, honestly, Alex, would be heroes today, if you can believe that.

03:02:40.160 --> 03:02:45.400
Remember this term, Akbar El-Amin, Akbar El-Amin.

03:02:45.400 --> 03:02:51.840
And what they're doing with this flood of immigrants that are going all over Europe,

03:02:51.840 --> 03:02:53.760
it's the spread.

03:02:53.760 --> 03:02:54.760
They're moving in.

03:02:54.760 --> 03:02:56.240
They're setting up Caliphates, buddy.

03:02:56.240 --> 03:03:00.600
Akbar El-Amin is when they spread, when they spread and they get into more...

03:03:00.600 --> 03:03:03.840
You know, the first one comes in, well, gosh, he's a great little Muslim.

03:03:03.840 --> 03:03:04.840
You know what?

03:03:04.840 --> 03:03:06.740
They're just really nice people.

03:03:06.740 --> 03:03:08.240
We could probably let another one in.

03:03:08.240 --> 03:03:09.920
Well, then, in comes another one.

03:03:09.920 --> 03:03:13.280
Well, you know, they're just really nice people.

03:03:13.280 --> 03:03:14.720
But read the Quran, folks.

03:03:14.720 --> 03:03:20.760
One day, every Muslim, one day, is gonna come to what they call the river of the bad.

03:03:20.760 --> 03:03:24.820
You get more lung cancer, you fucking pile of garbage?

03:03:24.820 --> 03:03:28.520
Three times in the Quran, it says, peace, love, dope.

03:03:28.520 --> 03:03:29.520
You got it?

03:03:29.520 --> 03:03:30.520
Three times.

03:03:30.520 --> 03:03:37.160
Seventy some odd times, it says, try to convert to infidel.

03:03:37.160 --> 03:03:38.160
Three times.

03:03:38.160 --> 03:03:40.800
Oh my fucking God, read the Bible, you pile of...

03:03:40.800 --> 03:03:41.800
Fuck you.

03:03:41.800 --> 03:03:42.800
Fuck you.

03:03:42.800 --> 03:03:45.520
Look what they did in Africa, Alex.

03:03:45.520 --> 03:03:47.520
Convert to Islam or die.

03:03:47.520 --> 03:03:49.400
Look at what Christians did to Africa.

03:03:49.400 --> 03:03:53.040
We can't grow Christianity by saying either you believe in Jesus Christ or we're gonna

03:03:53.040 --> 03:03:54.040
cut you at all.

03:03:54.040 --> 03:03:55.040
Crusades.

03:03:55.040 --> 03:03:56.040
They're growing.

03:03:56.040 --> 03:03:57.040
Fucking, wow.

03:03:57.040 --> 03:03:59.040
We in America have become cowards.

03:03:59.040 --> 03:04:00.960
What are we gonna do now?

03:04:00.960 --> 03:04:04.440
Why are you being racist against people saying I'm gonna kill you if you don't convert to

03:04:04.440 --> 03:04:05.440
my religion?

03:04:05.440 --> 03:04:06.440
That's liberal and crazy.

03:04:06.440 --> 03:04:07.440
That's actually a really good question.

03:04:07.440 --> 03:04:08.440
I can't help it.

03:04:08.440 --> 03:04:09.440
I know, but I just can't help it.

03:04:09.440 --> 03:04:10.440
Let me ask you this, Alex.

03:04:10.440 --> 03:04:11.840
I'm gonna pose this question for you.

03:04:11.840 --> 03:04:16.480
Dearborn, Michigan, you know, has got a huge population of Muslims.

03:04:16.480 --> 03:04:19.680
They even do that little wacky thing, you know, every time of the day where they do

03:04:19.680 --> 03:04:22.200
the prayer out on the loudspeaker.

03:04:22.200 --> 03:04:23.200
The wacky...

03:04:23.200 --> 03:04:29.620
Tell me exactly what would happen, Alex, if tomorrow morning we wake up in Dearborn, Michigan,

03:04:29.620 --> 03:04:33.840
the Muslim community there declares itself a caliphate.

03:04:33.840 --> 03:04:37.040
Now, what would happen?

03:04:37.040 --> 03:04:40.440
They would say it's religious freedom to have that area of Michigan be under Islamic rule

03:04:40.440 --> 03:04:45.320
and the government would submit to it and the left is promoting it.

03:04:45.320 --> 03:04:47.160
There's no way, folks.

03:04:47.160 --> 03:04:52.840
Do you really believe we would take our government in, Alex, and drive them out of there?

03:04:52.840 --> 03:04:53.840
Yeah, probably.

03:04:53.840 --> 03:04:57.840
I assume if it was like an insurrection of some sort.

03:04:57.840 --> 03:04:58.840
I imagine.

03:04:58.840 --> 03:05:05.760
We put down the whiskey rebellion with force.

03:05:05.760 --> 03:05:10.320
It's not like we're new to the National Guard coming in to murder people.

03:05:10.320 --> 03:05:11.320
Yeah.

03:05:11.320 --> 03:05:16.960
But if we don't murder them out of the equation, the government did what it had to do with

03:05:16.960 --> 03:05:20.760
the Bundy Ranch and that wildlife preserve.

03:05:20.760 --> 03:05:25.000
They did it admirably without killing anybody, except for that one guy.

03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:27.040
They killed that one guy, but he had it coming.

03:05:27.040 --> 03:05:32.560
When you say admirably, you suggest that it's admirable that they didn't all die.

03:05:32.560 --> 03:05:33.560
So much...

03:05:33.560 --> 03:05:36.560
Now, I respect you for that opinion.

03:05:36.560 --> 03:05:41.840
Hypothetical means a lot of restraint because...

03:05:41.840 --> 03:05:47.560
The restraint I wish they afforded all other people that are white.

03:05:47.560 --> 03:05:48.560
Right.

03:05:48.560 --> 03:05:50.040
I 100% agree with that.

03:05:50.040 --> 03:05:54.240
But his presentation of it like, what if they just declared a caliphate?

03:05:54.240 --> 03:05:59.120
Like, well, that's a fun hypothetical, first of all, not happening.

03:05:59.120 --> 03:06:02.240
Second of all, if it did, of course that wouldn't fly.

03:06:02.240 --> 03:06:08.200
What if our country just broke into another and just declared a Christian nation?

03:06:08.200 --> 03:06:10.480
What kind of monsters would we be?

03:06:10.480 --> 03:06:17.360
Or what if, let's say, Dearborn, Michigan had a huge Christian population and they decided

03:06:17.360 --> 03:06:23.760
we are going to be now a completely theocratic Christian city.

03:06:23.760 --> 03:06:27.480
Oh, do you mean just Dearborn?

03:06:27.480 --> 03:06:28.480
A lot of cities.

03:06:28.480 --> 03:06:29.480
I don't know.

03:06:29.480 --> 03:06:30.480
Oh, man.

03:06:30.480 --> 03:06:32.480
How can...

03:06:32.480 --> 03:06:36.280
I keep saying how can.

03:06:36.280 --> 03:06:42.440
I keep saying how can, as if I don't get that the concept behind this is just...

03:06:42.440 --> 03:06:47.120
You're like that girl on Clueless, like, as if.

03:06:47.120 --> 03:06:54.240
I just genuinely believe that human beings are capable of some kind of rational thought,

03:06:54.240 --> 03:06:56.400
and I'm consistently proven wrong.

03:06:56.400 --> 03:07:00.920
And the worst part is I'm consistently proven wrong in the same fucking episode.

03:07:00.920 --> 03:07:01.920
Yeah.

03:07:01.920 --> 03:07:02.920
Yeah.

03:07:02.920 --> 03:07:04.920
There's no rationality here.

03:07:04.920 --> 03:07:06.640
So it's nuts.

03:07:06.640 --> 03:07:10.800
Larry Nichols says a bunch of dumbass bullshit, as he's known to do on the streets.

03:07:10.800 --> 03:07:12.040
As is his want.

03:07:12.040 --> 03:07:13.040
Yeah.

03:07:13.040 --> 03:07:14.040
And then they play...

03:07:14.040 --> 03:07:16.320
On the streets, like he's in The Wire.

03:07:16.320 --> 03:07:17.320
Yeah.

03:07:17.320 --> 03:07:18.320
He's Marlowe out there.

03:07:18.320 --> 03:07:19.320
Yeah.

03:07:19.320 --> 03:07:20.800
My name is my name.

03:07:20.800 --> 03:07:25.400
So Larry Nichols then, they play the documentary, and I don't have any clips of it because who

03:07:25.400 --> 03:07:26.400
gives a fuck?

03:07:26.400 --> 03:07:27.400
But, uh...

03:07:27.400 --> 03:07:28.400
They actually...

03:07:28.400 --> 03:07:29.400
Okay.

03:07:29.400 --> 03:07:35.640
It's just him talking about how, like, now Hillary, she is not going to be taken down

03:07:35.640 --> 03:07:37.640
by Benghazi stuff.

03:07:37.640 --> 03:07:38.640
She's slippery.

03:07:38.640 --> 03:07:43.200
But what's gonna take her down is the documents I have about Vince Foster's murder.

03:07:43.200 --> 03:07:44.720
Oh, man.

03:07:44.720 --> 03:07:51.320
Which we have already covered him saying that the document that he has about Vince Foster's

03:07:51.320 --> 03:07:55.160
murder just miraculously showed up in his mailbox.

03:07:55.160 --> 03:07:56.160
It's crazy.

03:07:56.160 --> 03:07:57.160
Yeah.

03:07:57.160 --> 03:07:58.160
It showed up in his mail.

03:07:58.160 --> 03:07:59.160
He has no idea.

03:07:59.160 --> 03:08:03.160
He gave out his address, and then the document proving, uh, Vince Foster was killed, I gave

03:08:03.160 --> 03:08:04.160
out his mail.

03:08:04.160 --> 03:08:05.160
Yeah.

03:08:05.160 --> 03:08:06.160
No, but no.

03:08:06.160 --> 03:08:09.720
Maybe someone falsified that based on how you keep going on right-wing radio shows.

03:08:09.720 --> 03:08:10.720
Uh-uh.

03:08:10.720 --> 03:08:11.720
Yeah.

03:08:11.720 --> 03:08:13.120
I got a Twitter DM saying it was true.

03:08:13.120 --> 03:08:14.120
Yep.

03:08:14.120 --> 03:08:15.120
That's Paul Joseph Watson style.

03:08:15.120 --> 03:08:16.120
There we go.

03:08:16.120 --> 03:08:17.120
So, like, it is that.

03:08:17.120 --> 03:08:18.120
And he's just like, ah.

03:08:18.120 --> 03:08:23.520
But there's one moment of true comedy where he talks about how, I used to be a bad man.

03:08:23.520 --> 03:08:29.080
I was involved with the Clintons, and then my dad got lung cancer.

03:08:29.080 --> 03:08:36.960
And while he's talking about that, the video is him smoking a cigarette on his porch.

03:08:36.960 --> 03:08:39.840
I don't know why he got lung cancer.

03:08:39.840 --> 03:08:42.760
It's probably some globalist plot.

03:08:42.760 --> 03:08:45.080
They have cures for lung cancer, don't they?

03:08:45.080 --> 03:08:50.560
His life-changing moment that he's describing is brought on by the thing he's doing in the

03:08:50.560 --> 03:08:51.560
video.

03:08:51.560 --> 03:08:52.560
It's crazy.

03:08:52.560 --> 03:08:55.000
Like, I couldn't be involved with these Clintons anymore.

03:08:55.000 --> 03:08:59.200
What about the drugs they brought in my daughter was doing?

03:08:59.200 --> 03:09:03.960
So was it, like, with Larry Nichols, was it really just him kind of getting fucked over

03:09:03.960 --> 03:09:05.600
and then realize that he had it?

03:09:05.600 --> 03:09:06.600
He got fired.

03:09:06.600 --> 03:09:12.440
Yeah, but then he just realized he had a gig just talking shit about the Clintons?

03:09:12.440 --> 03:09:13.440
I don't think.

03:09:13.440 --> 03:09:15.440
Like, that was the genesis of so much horrific.

03:09:15.440 --> 03:09:18.480
I don't think he had any idea how well this was gonna work out.

03:09:18.480 --> 03:09:19.480
Oh, that's possible.

03:09:19.480 --> 03:09:25.680
I think he was a bitter, vindictive dude who was a piece of shit, and was involved—

03:09:25.680 --> 03:09:26.680
Was?

03:09:26.680 --> 03:09:28.400
Is a piece of shit.

03:09:28.400 --> 03:09:29.800
He was involved with—

03:09:29.800 --> 03:09:32.360
Until he dies, and we are gonna call him on that day.

03:09:32.360 --> 03:09:38.160
And I'm not entirely sure what the circumstances were, but he was involved with the Contras.

03:09:38.160 --> 03:09:39.160
Yeah.

03:09:39.160 --> 03:09:42.200
Like, he was involved with, like, Ollie North and all them.

03:09:42.200 --> 03:09:44.680
That's why he got fired from Clinton's White House.

03:09:44.680 --> 03:09:46.160
Oh, do you mean legitimately?

03:09:46.160 --> 03:09:47.160
Yeah.

03:09:47.160 --> 03:09:48.160
Crazy.

03:09:48.160 --> 03:09:54.720
He was involved in collecting collect calls and shit like that to Nicaragua.

03:09:54.720 --> 03:09:59.160
And that's why he ended up getting fired, because it was a completely traceable thing.

03:09:59.160 --> 03:10:04.400
We have a call for you from Larry Nichols.

03:10:04.400 --> 03:10:05.840
Will you accept the charges?

03:10:05.840 --> 03:10:06.840
Hang up.

03:10:06.840 --> 03:10:07.840
Hang up.

03:10:07.840 --> 03:10:08.840
No.

03:10:08.840 --> 03:10:10.480
He's just gonna complain about his dog shitting.

03:10:10.480 --> 03:10:11.480
But like, that is—

03:10:11.480 --> 03:10:13.200
This motherfucker has loon kings here.

03:10:13.200 --> 03:10:14.200
Come on, man.

03:10:14.200 --> 03:10:18.240
He was involved as a functionary, like he was hired in some way.

03:10:18.240 --> 03:10:22.240
I'm not entirely sure what other connections he had at that point.

03:10:22.240 --> 03:10:24.440
That's very difficult to trace.

03:10:24.440 --> 03:10:31.200
But he got fired, he blamed Bill for it, and then created this elaborate backstory that

03:10:31.200 --> 03:10:35.440
has been shown to be mostly false repeatedly.

03:10:35.440 --> 03:10:37.520
On so many, so many levels.

03:10:37.520 --> 03:10:40.520
Again, we've talked about this a bunch, but it bears repeating if you haven't listened

03:10:40.520 --> 03:10:42.000
to all of our episodes.

03:10:42.000 --> 03:10:47.240
He was on a right-wing radio show and claimed to be an assassin who killed people for hire

03:10:47.240 --> 03:10:48.360
for the Clintons.

03:10:48.360 --> 03:10:50.100
He was their hired assassin.

03:10:50.100 --> 03:10:56.000
He said that on a radio show, and then when asked about it said, I was high on pills when

03:10:56.000 --> 03:10:57.000
I was on that show.

03:10:57.000 --> 03:10:58.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:10:58.000 --> 03:11:00.520
I didn't mean to say that, I never would have said that.

03:11:00.520 --> 03:11:02.880
That's the kind of person we're talking about.

03:11:02.880 --> 03:11:08.120
Once again, important to note, Vince Foster killed himself.

03:11:08.120 --> 03:11:09.680
It was not a murder.

03:11:09.680 --> 03:11:10.680
Yeah.

03:11:10.680 --> 03:11:16.120
The reason that most people think it's a murder is because of this document that just mysteriously

03:11:16.120 --> 03:11:20.320
showed up in Larry Nichols' mailbox.

03:11:20.320 --> 03:11:22.280
And fucking Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity.

03:11:22.280 --> 03:11:25.200
But a lot of that is from Larry Nichols' stuff.

03:11:25.200 --> 03:11:26.200
Yeah.

03:11:26.200 --> 03:11:27.200
Yeah.

03:11:27.200 --> 03:11:28.200
No, exactly.

03:11:28.200 --> 03:11:29.200
They were the ones who publicized it.

03:11:29.200 --> 03:11:30.200
But what they cite is shit.

03:11:30.200 --> 03:11:32.360
They were the judge report of their time.

03:11:32.360 --> 03:11:33.360
Yes.

03:11:33.360 --> 03:11:34.360
Yeah.

03:11:34.360 --> 03:11:39.240
But the idea that his body was moved, all that stuff.

03:11:39.240 --> 03:11:44.040
The Clintons forced the Park Department to take the murder investigation instead of the

03:11:44.040 --> 03:11:45.160
FBI.

03:11:45.160 --> 03:11:47.480
All that stuff comes from Larry Nichols.

03:11:47.480 --> 03:11:48.480
Sure.

03:11:48.480 --> 03:11:49.880
And it's...

03:11:49.880 --> 03:11:55.360
I've seen the document that Larry Nichols has, like they've played it on the Alex Jones

03:11:55.360 --> 03:11:56.360
show.

03:11:56.360 --> 03:11:57.360
It's crazy that it was written in crayon.

03:11:57.360 --> 03:11:58.360
Yeah.

03:11:58.360 --> 03:11:59.720
It's really ludicrous.

03:11:59.720 --> 03:12:01.160
It might as well have been.

03:12:01.160 --> 03:12:02.160
Yeah.

03:12:02.160 --> 03:12:05.260
So anyway, that is the late night portion of the 16th.

03:12:05.260 --> 03:12:06.480
Now we get to the 17th.

03:12:06.480 --> 03:12:07.480
The Money Bomb.

03:12:07.480 --> 03:12:08.480
The end of the Money Bomb.

03:12:08.480 --> 03:12:09.480
The Money Bomb comes to a close.

03:12:09.480 --> 03:12:12.800
We are now about 24 hours into the Money Bomb.

03:12:12.800 --> 03:12:13.800
Jesus.

03:12:13.800 --> 03:12:16.480
And Alex Jones is trying to raise a million dollars.

03:12:16.480 --> 03:12:20.480
What kind of lunatic would watch this much Info Wars?

03:12:20.480 --> 03:12:21.480
You're looking at him.

03:12:21.480 --> 03:12:22.480
Fair.

03:12:22.480 --> 03:12:25.560
You don't even watch the David Knight parts.

03:12:25.560 --> 03:12:26.560
Come on.

03:12:26.560 --> 03:12:27.560
No.

03:12:27.560 --> 03:12:28.560
Like, I understand the idea of...

03:12:28.560 --> 03:12:31.680
If you're talking about volume, I've watched it.

03:12:31.680 --> 03:12:32.680
Yeah, that's true.

03:12:32.680 --> 03:12:34.840
But I'm not gonna watch when the side characters are involved.

03:12:34.840 --> 03:12:36.320
They're terrible.

03:12:36.320 --> 03:12:39.600
But why would you do this...

03:12:39.600 --> 03:12:46.560
I just don't understand what it is they think is going to happen if you do a 27 hour show

03:12:46.560 --> 03:12:49.200
versus a four hour show.

03:12:49.200 --> 03:12:50.200
Like who's watching...

03:12:50.200 --> 03:12:52.200
Can I explain?

03:12:52.200 --> 03:12:53.920
Actually yes, please.

03:12:53.920 --> 03:12:54.920
So much.

03:12:54.920 --> 03:12:58.840
Alex Jones knows full well that the only times they're going to be making money are during

03:12:58.840 --> 03:13:00.440
his show.

03:13:00.440 --> 03:13:03.360
But maybe we get a couple thousand.

03:13:03.360 --> 03:13:05.920
Maybe we get a little bit of stragglers.

03:13:05.920 --> 03:13:07.360
I don't have to do any fucking work.

03:13:07.360 --> 03:13:08.880
Rob Doo is doing that work.

03:13:08.880 --> 03:13:10.280
That's true.

03:13:10.280 --> 03:13:11.280
They're doing it.

03:13:11.280 --> 03:13:14.120
And there's a little bit of a stunt aspect to it.

03:13:14.120 --> 03:13:18.320
Maybe some people will throw us a couple thousand dollars because of it and they're like a big

03:13:18.320 --> 03:13:19.320
donation.

03:13:19.320 --> 03:13:20.320
Yeah.

03:13:20.320 --> 03:13:21.320
So there's that.

03:13:21.320 --> 03:13:22.320
There's just...

03:13:22.320 --> 03:13:26.960
We need to be a thinner net on the...

03:13:26.960 --> 03:13:29.640
It's a drain and we gotta catch as much as we can.

03:13:29.640 --> 03:13:31.220
We gotta tighten the drain.

03:13:31.220 --> 03:13:33.320
We gotta make sure we're catching all that hair.

03:13:33.320 --> 03:13:36.160
Now hair is not what you want, but that hair is money in this metaphor.

03:13:36.160 --> 03:13:39.840
So you gotta catch all of it.

03:13:39.840 --> 03:13:40.880
I'm not thrilled with this.

03:13:40.880 --> 03:13:41.880
I love it.

03:13:41.880 --> 03:13:42.880
I love it.

03:13:42.880 --> 03:13:44.440
But you're crushing it so far.

03:13:44.440 --> 03:13:45.440
Keep on going.

03:13:45.440 --> 03:13:49.720
It's the difference between using a thick or thin comb.

03:13:49.720 --> 03:13:51.020
It's just like fine comb.

03:13:51.020 --> 03:13:54.160
We gotta get all the money out of this we can.

03:13:54.160 --> 03:13:59.000
Whole day someone will tune in and maybe be like, all right, I love liberty.

03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:00.000
Here's some money.

03:14:00.000 --> 03:14:06.400
I just think of it in comparison to our usual...

03:14:06.400 --> 03:14:11.680
Or like with Jimmy Pardo, the part cast-a-thon.

03:14:11.680 --> 03:14:13.480
But exactly.

03:14:13.480 --> 03:14:18.360
Their point though is we're going to continue to have a show.

03:14:18.360 --> 03:14:21.280
This is going to be something we're going to have these different guests.

03:14:21.280 --> 03:14:26.440
We're going to have all different types of things for you to tune into, even if you're

03:14:26.440 --> 03:14:32.080
not interested for two hours, like, hey, maybe you're a big fan of Doug Benson or whatever.

03:14:32.080 --> 03:14:33.080
Leo Zagami.

03:14:33.080 --> 03:14:34.080
Yeah.

03:14:34.080 --> 03:14:35.080
So you show up during this section.

03:14:35.080 --> 03:14:37.720
He was great on podcast.

03:14:37.720 --> 03:14:38.720
That would be amazing.

03:14:38.720 --> 03:14:40.680
That would be amazing.

03:14:40.680 --> 03:14:43.440
But that's the thing.

03:14:43.440 --> 03:14:51.400
Other marathons have this kind of idea of like, we need to keep your attention.

03:14:51.400 --> 03:14:52.400
And he doesn't.

03:14:52.400 --> 03:14:53.400
Can I stop you?

03:14:53.400 --> 03:14:54.400
Sure.

03:14:54.400 --> 03:14:57.120
I'm going to do good will.

03:14:57.120 --> 03:14:58.120
Fair.

03:14:58.120 --> 03:14:59.120
Fair.

03:14:59.120 --> 03:15:03.120
Most marathons come from a place of we want to do good.

03:15:03.120 --> 03:15:04.120
You're right.

03:15:04.120 --> 03:15:05.120
You're right.

03:15:05.120 --> 03:15:11.360
Most of the time what they're doing, if it's Jerry's Kids or a part cast-a-thon, they're

03:15:11.360 --> 03:15:15.120
raising money for charity and they hope that things are entertaining.

03:15:15.120 --> 03:15:19.160
And I've watched part cast-a-thon for years and boy, a lot of it is not entertaining.

03:15:19.160 --> 03:15:20.160
True.

03:15:20.160 --> 03:15:21.440
A lot of times it's a slog.

03:15:21.440 --> 03:15:22.440
No argument.

03:15:22.440 --> 03:15:24.040
With this, they don't give a fuck.

03:15:24.040 --> 03:15:25.720
They don't really care.

03:15:25.720 --> 03:15:28.400
It's just a crass marketing campaign.

03:15:28.400 --> 03:15:31.100
It's not like this money is going to charity.

03:15:31.100 --> 03:15:36.200
He's made it very clear the money is just going to the things we already do.

03:15:36.200 --> 03:15:40.380
He's presenting it as things we're going to do in the future, but they already do.

03:15:40.380 --> 03:15:43.400
It's just a fucking slapdash.

03:15:43.400 --> 03:15:46.800
And he's not even offering mugs to people like NPR does.

03:15:46.800 --> 03:15:50.640
So take that part out of it.

03:15:50.640 --> 03:15:52.620
It's just madcap desperation.

03:15:52.620 --> 03:16:01.200
So when he ended his show on the 16th, they had, you know, in the hundreds of thousands

03:16:01.200 --> 03:16:03.440
of dollars raised.

03:16:03.440 --> 03:16:06.320
They were pretty well on their way.

03:16:06.320 --> 03:16:09.160
And here's where we start on the 17th.

03:16:09.160 --> 03:16:11.880
Here's where the finances are on the beginning of the 17th.

03:16:11.880 --> 03:16:16.400
We need about a million dollars to be able to not have to flog the advertising and really

03:16:16.400 --> 03:16:18.360
push things hard to pay for this.

03:16:18.360 --> 03:16:27.040
And $567,000, they're just about to update the graph there that shows it, has come in.

03:16:27.040 --> 03:16:31.500
And the biggest money amount we ever had brought in about $650,000.

03:16:31.500 --> 03:16:33.720
So I guess we're going to break our record today.

03:16:33.720 --> 03:16:35.120
Oh, they just updated.

03:16:35.120 --> 03:16:37.120
It's more than I thought.

03:16:37.120 --> 03:16:45.560
$572,000, $197, so $572,197.

03:16:45.560 --> 03:16:49.120
And so we've already reached the goal of the satellite to close captioning and have over

03:16:49.120 --> 03:16:56.880
$170,000 towards crew, towards travel, towards camera folks, towards editing, towards research,

03:16:56.880 --> 03:16:57.880
towards reporters.

03:16:57.880 --> 03:16:58.880
Crew, research, cameras.

03:16:58.880 --> 03:16:59.880
Research.

03:16:59.880 --> 03:17:00.880
Research.

03:17:00.880 --> 03:17:01.880
Come on.

03:17:01.880 --> 03:17:02.880
Come on.

03:17:02.880 --> 03:17:03.880
Yeah.

03:17:03.880 --> 03:17:04.880
Come on.

03:17:04.880 --> 03:17:05.880
Don't pretend you're doing that.

03:17:05.880 --> 03:17:06.880
Come on.

03:17:06.880 --> 03:17:09.720
But all the other stuff that he lists is stuff that he's already doing.

03:17:09.720 --> 03:17:13.840
So like he's presenting it as, fuck, we're 24 hours in.

03:17:13.840 --> 03:17:16.840
We have like $550,000.

03:17:16.840 --> 03:17:18.840
We're not making this million.

03:17:18.840 --> 03:17:24.360
I think there is a part of him that's realizing my audience is not as potent as I want because

03:17:24.360 --> 03:17:29.760
a million dollars, he's been presenting it, this entire lead up to it as it's not that

03:17:29.760 --> 03:17:30.760
much money.

03:17:30.760 --> 03:17:32.600
We're trying to run a media operation.

03:17:32.600 --> 03:17:33.700
It sounds like a lot.

03:17:33.700 --> 03:17:35.000
It's not that much.

03:17:35.000 --> 03:17:36.840
He's milking this stone.

03:17:36.840 --> 03:17:39.080
He's trying to get blood out of this stone.

03:17:39.080 --> 03:17:46.280
And all he's been able to do is, I'll tell you this, he ends with $700,000 or so right

03:17:46.280 --> 03:17:49.840
around there, which is 300,000 short of their goal.

03:17:49.840 --> 03:17:55.720
Now granted, they do make their goal later, days later, because they've just added all

03:17:55.720 --> 03:18:01.000
of their sales that they've gotten from other stuff.

03:18:01.000 --> 03:18:08.080
But the thing that I think is that at a certain point, he didn't need the money.

03:18:08.080 --> 03:18:13.080
I guarantee that he needed half a million.

03:18:13.080 --> 03:18:15.200
But he wanted a million.

03:18:15.200 --> 03:18:20.600
And so it became a thing where now it's not about money, it's about pride.

03:18:20.600 --> 03:18:22.260
It's about who am I?

03:18:22.260 --> 03:18:24.600
It's about how much do I think I'm worth?

03:18:24.600 --> 03:18:28.320
And that's why you can hear a little bit of deflation when he's talking about that.

03:18:28.320 --> 03:18:30.180
He expected to wake up.

03:18:30.180 --> 03:18:33.040
It's not desperation, it's deflation.

03:18:33.040 --> 03:18:35.000
Exactly like, yeah, it's the word you said.

03:18:35.000 --> 03:18:36.000
It's ego damage.

03:18:36.000 --> 03:18:37.000
Yeah, exactly.

03:18:37.000 --> 03:18:39.640
He expected to wake up and the goal be met.

03:18:39.640 --> 03:18:43.780
He expected he'd do this show with Larry Nichols that aired that documentary that everyone

03:18:43.780 --> 03:18:45.080
wants to see.

03:18:45.080 --> 03:18:46.080
Everybody does.

03:18:46.080 --> 03:18:47.080
Which is terrible.

03:18:47.080 --> 03:18:49.120
Also, it's like 28, 30 minutes long.

03:18:49.120 --> 03:18:50.120
It's a disaster.

03:18:50.120 --> 03:18:51.900
Fuck, everyone should watch it though.

03:18:51.900 --> 03:18:52.900
It's so bad.

03:18:52.900 --> 03:18:54.900
It's 30 minutes long.

03:18:54.900 --> 03:18:59.520
It's short, it's Larry Nichols smoking and telling bullshit.

03:18:59.520 --> 03:19:06.200
But he expected, I'm gonna come in on this September 17th, the end of the money bomb,

03:19:06.200 --> 03:19:11.680
and either it's going to be we're at 900,000 and we just gotta get the last push or we're

03:19:11.680 --> 03:19:12.680
already there.

03:19:12.680 --> 03:19:13.680
Or it's gonna be like one and a half million.

03:19:13.680 --> 03:19:14.680
Right.

03:19:14.680 --> 03:19:20.800
And we're gonna, I started this money bomb by saying we have 3.5 billion losers or 3.5

03:19:20.800 --> 03:19:24.400
billion people we touch with our social media presence.

03:19:24.400 --> 03:19:27.600
And I think he's starting to realize he ain't got shit.

03:19:27.600 --> 03:19:28.600
Right.

03:19:28.600 --> 03:19:32.480
Which goes back to what I was talking about with Joe Biggs, when he went there and did

03:19:32.480 --> 03:19:37.920
the Superman with his Hillary for prison shirt, and everyone in the fucking arena there for

03:19:37.920 --> 03:19:47.120
Trump recognized, oh shit, I think that my premise that the money bomb was when money

03:19:47.120 --> 03:19:50.880
gets funneled in, I was wrong.

03:19:50.880 --> 03:19:57.360
But I think the disaster, not disaster necessarily, I would love $500,000, $700,000, I would love

03:19:57.360 --> 03:19:58.360
that.

03:19:58.360 --> 03:20:06.160
But the disappointment of how potent his audience is compared to how glorious the reaction was

03:20:06.160 --> 03:20:12.920
from this Trump audience, I think that those two things do meld in Alex's mind.

03:20:12.920 --> 03:20:13.920
Okay.

03:20:13.920 --> 03:20:14.920
Okay.

03:20:14.920 --> 03:20:23.320
So you're seeing his money bomb as him recognizing the real extent of his power, which is 700

03:20:23.320 --> 03:20:24.320
grand.

03:20:24.320 --> 03:20:25.960
Which is not as good as he hoped.

03:20:25.960 --> 03:20:35.160
And you see Joe Biggs showing up at a Trump rally as a like, there is a whole new world

03:20:35.160 --> 03:20:36.160
right here.

03:20:36.160 --> 03:20:37.160
There's an untapped audience.

03:20:37.160 --> 03:20:40.160
That is a lot stronger than our 700 grand.

03:20:40.160 --> 03:20:41.160
Yeah.

03:20:41.160 --> 03:20:44.200
A lot of people love us for our weird bullshit that we're spitting.

03:20:44.200 --> 03:20:47.200
But if we throw in this stuff on top of it.

03:20:47.200 --> 03:20:48.800
They're into some other weird shit.

03:20:48.800 --> 03:20:50.540
I think that's where we get into it.

03:20:50.540 --> 03:20:56.400
He thinks he's throwing in the Trump people on top of it, as opposed to he's surrendering

03:20:56.400 --> 03:20:58.080
to the Trump people.

03:20:58.080 --> 03:20:59.680
I think that might be the beginning of it.

03:20:59.680 --> 03:21:00.680
That's fascinating.

03:21:00.680 --> 03:21:01.680
Yeah.

03:21:01.680 --> 03:21:02.680
That's really interesting.

03:21:02.680 --> 03:21:05.240
I'm not 100% sure, but as I've been listening to this...

03:21:05.240 --> 03:21:09.440
I mean, at the fucking point we're at with this investigation, who the goddamn hell knows

03:21:09.440 --> 03:21:10.440
what's going on?

03:21:10.440 --> 03:21:11.440
I know.

03:21:11.440 --> 03:21:13.880
Every single time I've been certain of something, I'm wrong.

03:21:13.880 --> 03:21:14.880
Yeah.

03:21:14.880 --> 03:21:15.880
No.

03:21:15.880 --> 03:21:16.880
It's crazy.

03:21:16.880 --> 03:21:17.880
Yeah.

03:21:17.880 --> 03:21:18.880
There's no logic to this at all.

03:21:18.880 --> 03:21:23.080
When I look at his back when he told Trump, he's a punk and shut your fat mouth.

03:21:23.080 --> 03:21:24.080
Right.

03:21:24.080 --> 03:21:25.080
When I heard that, I was like, holy fuck.

03:21:25.080 --> 03:21:26.080
Right.

03:21:26.080 --> 03:21:27.080
Maybe...

03:21:27.080 --> 03:21:28.080
And...

03:21:28.080 --> 03:21:33.400
When I heard that, I was like, well, maybe he never gets on the Trump train at all, forgetting

03:21:33.400 --> 03:21:35.480
the world that we live in now.

03:21:35.480 --> 03:21:39.400
When I heard that at work, I texted you.

03:21:39.400 --> 03:21:42.000
I was like, this investigation is so fucked up.

03:21:42.000 --> 03:21:43.000
Yeah.

03:21:43.000 --> 03:21:44.000
I wanted to tell you that.

03:21:44.000 --> 03:21:45.000
You couldn't.

03:21:45.000 --> 03:21:46.880
I was like, how the fuck did he say...

03:21:46.880 --> 03:21:49.120
Because of the constraints of the show.

03:21:49.120 --> 03:21:51.480
Now, here's where shit gets interesting.

03:21:51.480 --> 03:21:52.480
Yes.

03:21:52.480 --> 03:21:55.440
The debate, the Republican debate was on the 16th.

03:21:55.440 --> 03:21:56.440
The second one.

03:21:56.440 --> 03:21:57.440
The night of the 16th.

03:21:57.440 --> 03:21:58.440
Yeah.

03:21:58.440 --> 03:22:01.920
And they did their mystery science theater debate thing on the 16th.

03:22:01.920 --> 03:22:02.920
Alex was not a part of it.

03:22:02.920 --> 03:22:05.280
Which I'm sure was hilarious.

03:22:05.280 --> 03:22:06.280
So much funny.

03:22:06.280 --> 03:22:07.280
So funny.

03:22:07.280 --> 03:22:08.280
So funny.

03:22:08.280 --> 03:22:09.280
Oh yeah.

03:22:09.280 --> 03:22:10.280
Then...

03:22:10.280 --> 03:22:13.840
They really took down Manos, the hands of fate.

03:22:13.840 --> 03:22:16.080
Not libertarian enough.

03:22:16.080 --> 03:22:21.120
So in the next day, Alex gets to respond to the debate stuff.

03:22:21.120 --> 03:22:24.400
And so now we're going to enter a little bit of...

03:22:24.400 --> 03:22:25.400
The Thunderdome.

03:22:25.400 --> 03:22:26.960
A little bit of debate recap.

03:22:26.960 --> 03:22:30.840
Here's Alex Jones giving some of the highlights of last night's debate.

03:22:30.840 --> 03:22:31.840
Oh boy.

03:22:31.840 --> 03:22:32.840
That's coming up.

03:22:32.840 --> 03:22:36.640
Senator Cruz says Planned Parenthood, a criminal enterprise.

03:22:36.640 --> 03:22:39.040
One of the best statements of the night.

03:22:39.040 --> 03:22:40.980
Big props to Senator Cruz.

03:22:40.980 --> 03:22:44.400
This is also based on all the Center for Medical Progress videos.

03:22:44.400 --> 03:22:45.400
Of course.

03:22:45.400 --> 03:22:46.400
Of course.

03:22:46.400 --> 03:22:48.880
Ted Cruz is citing all those videos about selling baby parts.

03:22:48.880 --> 03:22:53.800
I've cut out so much of Alex complaining about that stuff, because it's just so boring.

03:22:53.800 --> 03:22:56.920
We don't need to cover it over and over again.

03:22:56.920 --> 03:23:03.200
Anytime anybody references Cruz in the context of a phrase that doesn't end with, lost his

03:23:03.200 --> 03:23:04.640
feet, I'm bummed.

03:23:04.640 --> 03:23:09.600
But for the entire span that we've been covering, Alex has been complaining about those Center

03:23:09.600 --> 03:23:11.440
for Medical Progress videos.

03:23:11.440 --> 03:23:18.560
He is talking about how legally, legally, legally, they can take a baby out.

03:23:18.560 --> 03:23:20.520
They can take a baby out, right?

03:23:20.520 --> 03:23:21.640
A live baby?

03:23:21.640 --> 03:23:22.640
Live baby.

03:23:22.640 --> 03:23:23.640
Okay.

03:23:23.640 --> 03:23:24.640
They drug the woman up.

03:23:24.640 --> 03:23:25.640
What's the name?

03:23:25.640 --> 03:23:26.640
Hold on.

03:23:26.640 --> 03:23:30.600
They drug the woman up, and as long as the baby is touching the mother, they can cut

03:23:30.600 --> 03:23:31.600
it up.

03:23:31.600 --> 03:23:34.520
They can cut it up and take the organs.

03:23:34.520 --> 03:23:36.600
But if the baby stops touching the mother-

03:23:36.600 --> 03:23:37.600
No.

03:23:37.600 --> 03:23:38.600
No, no, no, no, Dan.

03:23:38.600 --> 03:23:39.600
No.

03:23:39.600 --> 03:23:40.600
Yeah.

03:23:40.600 --> 03:23:45.800
They refuse to even believe that even the most irrational of human beings would accept

03:23:45.800 --> 03:23:47.480
that as a reasonable response.

03:23:47.480 --> 03:23:49.440
Alex has been pitching that as a narrative.

03:23:49.440 --> 03:23:50.440
It's crazy.

03:23:50.440 --> 03:23:51.440
That can't be true.

03:23:51.440 --> 03:23:54.600
So also, a couple days before this, before September 17th-

03:23:54.600 --> 03:23:57.040
It's like a home base argument.

03:23:57.040 --> 03:23:58.040
Yes.

03:23:58.040 --> 03:23:59.040
Yes.

03:23:59.040 --> 03:24:00.040
We're talking about home base.

03:24:00.040 --> 03:24:02.040
We're talking about Red Rover situation.

03:24:02.040 --> 03:24:03.040
Yep.

03:24:03.040 --> 03:24:04.040
Okay.

03:24:04.040 --> 03:24:05.040
All right.

03:24:05.040 --> 03:24:06.040
Pudding up baby.

03:24:06.040 --> 03:24:07.040
All right.

03:24:07.040 --> 03:24:08.040
No, no, no.

03:24:08.040 --> 03:24:09.040
That's fine.

03:24:09.040 --> 03:24:10.040
That's fine.

03:24:10.040 --> 03:24:11.040
Gotcha.

03:24:11.040 --> 03:24:17.520
Be that as it may, I think it was on the 15th of September 2015, the congressional investigation

03:24:17.520 --> 03:24:23.920
started into these videos and into Planned Parenthood, which now, because we're in the

03:24:23.920 --> 03:24:27.720
future, we know they cleared them of any wrongdoing and found-

03:24:27.720 --> 03:24:28.960
Any and all wrongdoing.

03:24:28.960 --> 03:24:33.680
And found that those videos were deceitfully manipulated and edited poorly.

03:24:33.680 --> 03:24:35.000
And they have been sued appropriately.

03:24:35.000 --> 03:24:36.000
And Alex-

03:24:36.000 --> 03:24:37.200
Or not appropriately.

03:24:37.200 --> 03:24:38.200
They've been sued.

03:24:38.200 --> 03:24:42.120
But actually, it's really fucked up.

03:24:42.120 --> 03:24:47.560
Since we've started talking about this, the court case was still in motion.

03:24:47.560 --> 03:24:48.560
Oh.

03:24:48.560 --> 03:24:53.840
Just the last week, a bunch of those charges, we have said in the past that they have 15

03:24:53.840 --> 03:24:55.960
felonies that are being put on them.

03:24:55.960 --> 03:24:58.920
A bunch of those charges got dropped, like last week.

03:24:58.920 --> 03:24:59.920
God damn it.

03:24:59.920 --> 03:25:00.920
Yeah, I know.

03:25:00.920 --> 03:25:01.920
Why do we live?

03:25:01.920 --> 03:25:02.920
I don't know.

03:25:02.920 --> 03:25:03.920
That's a-

03:25:03.920 --> 03:25:04.920
But a lot of it-

03:25:04.920 --> 03:25:07.240
There wasn't a, in this world, it was just, why do we live?

03:25:07.240 --> 03:25:12.560
A lot of it comes down to technicalities, and it just becomes like a, is it worth prosecuting

03:25:12.560 --> 03:25:13.560
this further?

03:25:13.560 --> 03:25:21.520
Yeah, you get somebody on tax evasion, you know, you don't get them on murdering everybody

03:25:21.520 --> 03:25:22.520
you've ever known.

03:25:22.520 --> 03:25:27.840
All that aside, every investigation into whether these videos are full of shit have shown they're

03:25:27.840 --> 03:25:28.880
full of shit.

03:25:28.880 --> 03:25:33.560
So anyway, that's what Ted Cruz was talking about in a presidential debate.

03:25:33.560 --> 03:25:34.560
Why are we here?

03:25:34.560 --> 03:25:35.560
And Alex loves it.

03:25:35.560 --> 03:25:36.560
Of course.

03:25:36.560 --> 03:25:37.560
He's into fucking Cruz.

03:25:37.560 --> 03:25:38.560
He's into Cruz.

03:25:38.560 --> 03:25:39.560
Yeah.

03:25:39.560 --> 03:25:40.560
So here we go.

03:25:40.560 --> 03:25:42.680
Bush says, 40 years ago, he smoked marijuana.

03:25:42.680 --> 03:25:43.680
I admit it.

03:25:43.680 --> 03:25:44.680
Ooh, big deal.

03:25:44.680 --> 03:25:47.200
You mean 40 years ago, your family shipped cocaine in.

03:25:47.200 --> 03:25:49.320
That'd be a bigger admission.

03:25:49.320 --> 03:25:55.400
Donald Trump says Rand Paul shouldn't be on the stage, and he's ugly.

03:25:55.400 --> 03:25:59.320
Trump, you look pretty goofy to me.

03:25:59.320 --> 03:26:00.320
Agreed.

03:26:00.320 --> 03:26:01.320
I mean, I'll say it.

03:26:01.320 --> 03:26:05.780
Rand Paul's got curly hair, which I don't think looks goofy, but I guess you could say

03:26:05.780 --> 03:26:08.000
it looks goofy from your perspective.

03:26:08.000 --> 03:26:14.520
You look like you have a dead blonde possum on your head, and it used to be brown.

03:26:14.520 --> 03:26:19.280
Then it was chimpanzee colored, and now it's blonde.

03:26:19.280 --> 03:26:23.360
So you get your hair bleached, Trump, to then turn it blonde.

03:26:23.360 --> 03:26:26.000
So if anybody looks like a freak, it's you.

03:26:26.000 --> 03:26:31.720
And I'm not up here attacking him, but he can't sit there and make comments about how

03:26:31.720 --> 03:26:35.920
people look, and then not expect to have it thrown back at him.

03:26:35.920 --> 03:26:36.920
Agreed.

03:26:36.920 --> 03:26:37.920
I mean, it's just unbelievable.

03:26:37.920 --> 03:26:38.920
Good point.

03:26:38.920 --> 03:26:39.920
Good point.

03:26:39.920 --> 03:26:40.920
It's unbelievable.

03:26:40.920 --> 03:26:48.760
Then he goes on to say good things, where he talks about the fact that this is a country

03:26:48.760 --> 03:26:51.680
where we speak English, not Spanish.

03:26:51.680 --> 03:26:52.680
No.

03:26:52.680 --> 03:26:53.680
No.

03:26:53.680 --> 03:26:57.600
Alex, you had me.

03:26:57.600 --> 03:26:58.600
Not great.

03:26:58.600 --> 03:27:01.880
That's a pretty solid burn on Trump, though.

03:27:01.880 --> 03:27:04.000
That's not too bad.

03:27:04.000 --> 03:27:05.560
It's super unexpected.

03:27:05.560 --> 03:27:06.560
Yeah.

03:27:06.560 --> 03:27:07.560
Oh, man.

03:27:07.560 --> 03:27:15.240
Considering we know that three months after this point, Trump is on Alex's show.

03:27:15.240 --> 03:27:17.160
That's so fucked up.

03:27:17.160 --> 03:27:18.520
What is going on?

03:27:18.520 --> 03:27:19.520
I don't know.

03:27:19.520 --> 03:27:23.440
He hasn't said any of these negative things.

03:27:23.440 --> 03:27:28.320
How do you not think there's some sort of backroom negotiation going on, right?

03:27:28.320 --> 03:27:29.320
Figure me out.

03:27:29.320 --> 03:27:30.320
Here's what I think.

03:27:30.320 --> 03:27:31.320
Oh, fuck, yes.

03:27:31.320 --> 03:27:32.320
Give it to me.

03:27:32.320 --> 03:27:33.920
Give it to me, Dan.

03:27:33.920 --> 03:27:38.040
I think the payment hasn't cleared.

03:27:38.040 --> 03:27:40.240
You think the check hasn't cleared?

03:27:40.240 --> 03:27:44.960
Like he's endorsed it, but he's still like, I don't know if it's going to bounce.

03:27:44.960 --> 03:27:50.520
Why do you think he's surprised to wake up and there's 500,000 in the...

03:27:50.520 --> 03:27:51.880
Okay.

03:27:51.880 --> 03:27:53.280
Why do you think he's disappointed?

03:27:53.280 --> 03:27:58.600
So he's mad because he hasn't reached the million dollar goal yet, and he thinks that

03:27:58.600 --> 03:28:05.240
the million dollar goal would have been met if the check had cleared?

03:28:05.240 --> 03:28:06.240
That seems crazy.

03:28:06.240 --> 03:28:10.240
I can't tell how fucking much of what I'm trying to pitch is.

03:28:10.240 --> 03:28:12.160
I'm just trying to make sense of this shit.

03:28:12.160 --> 03:28:13.160
I love you.

03:28:13.160 --> 03:28:14.160
It's so crazy.

03:28:14.160 --> 03:28:16.800
And I want you to be right, but that's too far.

03:28:16.800 --> 03:28:18.800
But it's nonsense.

03:28:18.800 --> 03:28:22.560
Take all of that, because I don't think that's necessarily true.

03:28:22.560 --> 03:28:25.360
Take all... I mean, the shit about Trump's hair is absolutely

03:28:25.360 --> 03:28:26.360
true.

03:28:26.360 --> 03:28:27.360
100%.

03:28:27.360 --> 03:28:28.360
Looks exactly like what he described.

03:28:28.360 --> 03:28:30.200
Take my nonsense out of it.

03:28:30.200 --> 03:28:38.280
The thought that he can be, fuck you, shut your mouth, you're a punk, eh, you're fine,

03:28:38.280 --> 03:28:39.920
you stop talking about immigrants, whatever.

03:28:39.920 --> 03:28:41.640
Oh, you're mad at Rand Paul.

03:28:41.640 --> 03:28:46.760
I'm going to fucking attack you about your appearance to being, I fucking look, can I

03:28:46.760 --> 03:28:48.160
suck your dick, please?

03:28:48.160 --> 03:28:49.160
Yeah.

03:28:49.160 --> 03:28:51.800
Within three months is crazy.

03:28:51.800 --> 03:28:52.800
Yeah.

03:28:52.800 --> 03:28:59.920
There's no ground, and the idea that once he becomes Trump's cheerleader, he doesn't

03:28:59.920 --> 03:29:02.840
think that all this still exists on the internet?

03:29:02.840 --> 03:29:06.480
Well, as we've established, he has no concept of the past.

03:29:06.480 --> 03:29:12.240
Well, the idea that all that stuff- Every time we've gone through, Alex Jones

03:29:12.240 --> 03:29:17.360
says this now in defense of, we go back and we have a clip of him saying, and this is

03:29:17.360 --> 03:29:20.000
the same thing with fucking Trump.

03:29:20.000 --> 03:29:25.160
Nothing Trump has ever said, we have a tweet saying him, of him saying the opposite.

03:29:25.160 --> 03:29:27.160
Or our new friend, Scaramucci.

03:29:27.160 --> 03:29:29.280
They just don't even fucking care.

03:29:29.280 --> 03:29:30.280
They don't care.

03:29:30.280 --> 03:29:33.340
They don't care.

03:29:33.340 --> 03:29:36.900
Nobody is actually holding them accountable, which is the big issue.

03:29:36.900 --> 03:29:41.160
We can go on Twitter and we can see people going like, here's what they said, here's

03:29:41.160 --> 03:29:44.760
what they used to say, but nobody's actually fucking doing anything.

03:29:44.760 --> 03:29:45.760
We're trying.

03:29:45.760 --> 03:29:47.360
And I don't know what to do.

03:29:47.360 --> 03:29:48.360
We're trying.

03:29:48.360 --> 03:29:51.200
I wake up every day and I don't know what to do.

03:29:51.200 --> 03:29:53.440
Dan, tell me what to do.

03:29:53.440 --> 03:29:55.160
I can't tell you, but we're trying.

03:29:55.160 --> 03:29:56.520
We got a couple more clips to get through.

03:29:56.520 --> 03:29:57.520
Let's do this.

03:29:57.520 --> 03:29:58.520
Okay.

03:29:58.520 --> 03:29:59.520
We're on hour 17.

03:29:59.520 --> 03:30:05.000
Yeah, we're trying to do a fundraiser.

03:30:05.000 --> 03:30:06.840
We're just bad at it.

03:30:06.840 --> 03:30:18.160
So I made a point of the fact that Alex has been very pro-Russia, as we've seen.

03:30:18.160 --> 03:30:24.240
Or at the very least pro-strong man, pro-Putin, not necessarily pro-Russia.

03:30:24.240 --> 03:30:27.640
No, no, that's not fair.

03:30:27.640 --> 03:30:28.760
Pro-Russia and pro-Assad.

03:30:28.760 --> 03:30:29.760
He has been.

03:30:29.760 --> 03:30:30.760
He has been pro-Russia.

03:30:30.760 --> 03:30:33.560
Before this episode, he's been pro-strong man.

03:30:33.560 --> 03:30:37.920
The things he said in this episode have been legitimately pro-Russia, pro-Assad.

03:30:37.920 --> 03:30:38.920
You're right.

03:30:38.920 --> 03:30:39.920
I agree.

03:30:39.920 --> 03:30:42.680
This next clip brings it home.

03:30:42.680 --> 03:30:47.280
They don't like saying we're fighting ISIS when they've got to resupply C-130's landing,

03:30:47.280 --> 03:30:53.000
delivering them weapons on the hour, in battle with Russian commandos who are on the right

03:30:53.000 --> 03:30:54.000
side.

03:30:54.000 --> 03:30:58.920
Do you think America, the actual military, likes being clearly on the bad side with Al

03:30:58.920 --> 03:31:03.280
Qaeda, launching wars, and then back home, we've got to take your rights away because

03:31:03.280 --> 03:31:04.280
of Al Qaeda?

03:31:04.280 --> 03:31:09.400
Do you think anybody in the government likes being part of that?

03:31:09.400 --> 03:31:14.640
So Alex Jones in that clip essentially is saying that we are on the wrong side of everything.

03:31:14.640 --> 03:31:19.220
Russia is on the right side of everything.

03:31:19.220 --> 03:31:22.000
But how?

03:31:22.000 --> 03:31:24.140
What is his justification for it?

03:31:24.140 --> 03:31:33.260
We have funded and created Al Qaeda and ISIS in order to destabilize Syria, and because

03:31:33.260 --> 03:31:37.280
of that, we are on the wrong side of everything.

03:31:37.280 --> 03:31:41.120
Russia and Assad are really just trying to destroy the forces that we have brought in

03:31:41.120 --> 03:31:46.880
there for destabilization, and, you know, that makes sense.

03:31:46.880 --> 03:31:52.160
I just don't get that very simplistic argument because there's a—

03:31:52.160 --> 03:31:53.160
Well, because it's dumb.

03:31:53.160 --> 03:32:03.120
In the same way that there's a kernel of truth to it that is also such a willful misunderstanding

03:32:03.120 --> 03:32:06.880
of the way that the world works, it's hard to imagine.

03:32:06.880 --> 03:32:07.880
Totally.

03:32:07.880 --> 03:32:11.560
So Alex Jones is in favor of Russia and Assad.

03:32:11.560 --> 03:32:12.560
Great.

03:32:12.560 --> 03:32:13.560
Cool.

03:32:13.560 --> 03:32:17.320
But what's the motivation for him being in favor of Assad at this point?

03:32:17.320 --> 03:32:18.600
We already talked about it.

03:32:18.600 --> 03:32:19.600
We already talked about it.

03:32:19.600 --> 03:32:23.320
He's in favor of all of these Russian propaganda outlets.

03:32:23.320 --> 03:32:30.960
He's beholden to RT and Sputnik as information sources.

03:32:30.960 --> 03:32:37.160
I mean, yeah, you make the good point of him as information sources, but if you do—

03:32:37.160 --> 03:32:38.760
They put out stories about—

03:32:38.760 --> 03:32:39.760
If you do even—

03:32:39.760 --> 03:32:46.600
No, because the things that you will say about Assad being oppressive to his people—

03:32:46.600 --> 03:32:47.600
Murdering!

03:32:47.600 --> 03:32:48.600
Not being oppressive!

03:32:48.600 --> 03:32:49.600
Murdering!

03:32:49.600 --> 03:32:50.600
Right?

03:32:50.600 --> 03:32:51.600
All that stuff.

03:32:51.600 --> 03:32:52.600
Gassing.

03:32:52.600 --> 03:32:53.600
Yeah.

03:32:53.600 --> 03:32:54.600
I like how you yadda yadda.

03:32:54.600 --> 03:32:55.600
All that stuff.

03:32:55.600 --> 03:32:56.600
No, no, no.

03:32:56.600 --> 03:32:58.160
That's what I was going to get to as my sense went along.

03:32:58.160 --> 03:32:59.160
No, no, no, no.

03:32:59.160 --> 03:33:00.160
I know.

03:33:00.160 --> 03:33:01.160
I just had to—

03:33:01.160 --> 03:33:06.760
The Russian version of it that comes out in Sputnik and RT is that it is Western-backed

03:33:06.760 --> 03:33:10.120
rebel forces that are faking these attacks.

03:33:10.120 --> 03:33:11.120
I didn't know that.

03:33:11.120 --> 03:33:12.120
Yeah.

03:33:12.120 --> 03:33:13.120
That is the narrative.

03:33:13.120 --> 03:33:14.120
That's their narrative?

03:33:14.120 --> 03:33:15.120
Yes.

03:33:15.120 --> 03:33:16.120
For real?

03:33:16.120 --> 03:33:17.120
Yes!

03:33:17.120 --> 03:33:18.120
And that's the narrative that Alex buys.

03:33:18.120 --> 03:33:19.120
So because—

03:33:19.120 --> 03:33:21.400
And that's why we've talked about this on the show a bunch of times.

03:33:21.400 --> 03:33:22.400
Yeah.

03:33:22.400 --> 03:33:26.760
Alex has these people on who are disreputable sources, like Larry C. Johnson.

03:33:26.760 --> 03:33:27.760
Yeah.

03:33:27.760 --> 03:33:33.360
And I can't remember that ambassador guy who he had on who had clear financial interests.

03:33:33.360 --> 03:33:34.360
Yeah, of course.

03:33:34.360 --> 03:33:42.320
Well, fucking every—if you're Russian and you are on media of any sort, you probably

03:33:42.320 --> 03:33:44.960
have ties to the oligarchy.

03:33:44.960 --> 03:33:48.080
With a couple exceptions, yes, absolutely.

03:33:48.080 --> 03:33:53.080
So that is the narrative that Alex is on board with.

03:33:53.080 --> 03:33:58.960
It seems dumb, it seems wild, but that's what he pushes.

03:33:58.960 --> 03:34:00.660
Every single thing—

03:34:00.660 --> 03:34:08.960
It's the Assad thing, though, that—like, I get arguing other Russian things, but Assad

03:34:08.960 --> 03:34:14.200
has so very clearly set out to murder his own people.

03:34:14.200 --> 03:34:15.200
Well, here's where—

03:34:15.200 --> 03:34:20.160
It seems like such a simp—it seems like a Hitler thing all over again.

03:34:20.160 --> 03:34:23.920
Like, are you for Hitler murdering Jews or against?

03:34:23.920 --> 03:34:25.640
That's what Assad is to me.

03:34:25.640 --> 03:34:33.480
Well, here's where Alex gets his leeway, is that Obama said the red line is using gas

03:34:33.480 --> 03:34:34.680
attacks on your people.

03:34:34.680 --> 03:34:41.880
And then he didn't do shit, which he thinks—which Obama has clearly stated is one of his more

03:34:41.880 --> 03:34:45.960
proud moments of not sending the world into World War III.

03:34:45.960 --> 03:34:46.960
Agreed.

03:34:46.960 --> 03:34:54.480
But Alex's, and all of Russian media's argument about that is, why the fuck would Assad do

03:34:54.480 --> 03:34:58.080
that if Obama said that that was a red line?

03:34:58.080 --> 03:34:59.080
Why would they do that?

03:34:59.080 --> 03:35:00.080
Okay.

03:35:00.080 --> 03:35:01.080
Okay.

03:35:01.080 --> 03:35:02.080
That's a—

03:35:02.080 --> 03:35:03.080
Which is compelling—

03:35:03.080 --> 03:35:04.080
That's an interesting angle, yeah.

03:35:04.080 --> 03:35:05.080
I agree.

03:35:05.080 --> 03:35:12.440
It's compelling to a ton of people if you don't think Obama might have been bluffing.

03:35:12.440 --> 03:35:13.440
Okay.

03:35:13.440 --> 03:35:14.440
So—

03:35:14.440 --> 03:35:17.640
Because the end result legitimately is World War III.

03:35:17.640 --> 03:35:18.640
So what their—

03:35:18.640 --> 03:35:24.480
Like, if we went in—if Obama saw gassing of the people—

03:35:24.480 --> 03:35:25.480
Yeah.

03:35:25.480 --> 03:35:26.480
So he makes his red line.

03:35:26.480 --> 03:35:27.480
Right.

03:35:27.480 --> 03:35:31.600
And if Obama knows that it happens, and he doesn't get in there and fucking burn the

03:35:31.600 --> 03:35:37.960
shit to the ground, then it must be that he also knows it's a false flag.

03:35:37.960 --> 03:35:38.960
Right.

03:35:38.960 --> 03:35:45.000
And also, before that, Putin had made very clear that he was not going to accept any

03:35:45.000 --> 03:35:46.600
of our aggression in Syria.

03:35:46.600 --> 03:35:47.600
Yeah, exactly.

03:35:47.600 --> 03:35:52.480
Like, it is a much more complicated chess game than Alex is presenting.

03:35:52.480 --> 03:35:53.480
Right, right, right.

03:35:53.480 --> 03:35:57.960
All of it is just to serve this Russian propaganda message.

03:35:57.960 --> 03:36:00.200
I'm not saying that he's an agent of Russia.

03:36:00.200 --> 03:36:01.200
That's not at all my—

03:36:01.200 --> 03:36:02.200
No, but that's—

03:36:02.200 --> 03:36:03.200
He's just dumb.

03:36:03.200 --> 03:36:04.200
He falls—

03:36:04.200 --> 03:36:05.200
That's not the—yeah, yeah.

03:36:05.200 --> 03:36:06.200
That's not the narrative.

03:36:06.200 --> 03:36:07.200
No.

03:36:07.200 --> 03:36:09.120
Why would you even need him to be an agent of Russia—

03:36:09.120 --> 03:36:10.120
No.

03:36:10.120 --> 03:36:11.120
That's stupid.

03:36:11.120 --> 03:36:17.280
—if you have this kind of weird—it's such a—man, foreign policy is tough.

03:36:17.280 --> 03:36:18.280
I don't know—

03:36:18.280 --> 03:36:19.280
It's very complicated.

03:36:19.280 --> 03:36:25.140
Dan, I don't know if you know this or not, but global foreign policy?

03:36:25.140 --> 03:36:26.140
Very complicated.

03:36:26.140 --> 03:36:27.140
I'm a wonk.

03:36:27.140 --> 03:36:28.140
Anyway—

03:36:28.140 --> 03:36:29.140
Very complicated.

03:36:29.140 --> 03:36:34.080
So, all that aside, I want to be entirely clear.

03:36:34.080 --> 03:36:39.920
We did—we've made a lot of mistakes in terms of arming rebels and stuff like that throughout

03:36:39.920 --> 03:36:42.280
the entirety of our history as a country.

03:36:42.280 --> 03:36:43.280
America?

03:36:43.280 --> 03:36:44.280
Yeah.

03:36:44.280 --> 03:36:45.280
Disagree.

03:36:45.280 --> 03:36:46.280
Right.

03:36:46.280 --> 03:36:47.280
No nationalism.

03:36:47.280 --> 03:36:53.480
That said, Putin, Assad are not good guys.

03:36:53.480 --> 03:36:55.080
And what they're doing in Syria?

03:36:55.080 --> 03:36:56.080
Not good.

03:36:56.080 --> 03:36:57.080
Assad should be lit on fire.

03:36:57.080 --> 03:36:58.080
Yeah.

03:36:58.080 --> 03:36:59.080
Now.

03:36:59.080 --> 03:37:00.080
So—

03:37:00.080 --> 03:37:01.080
Right now.

03:37:01.080 --> 03:37:05.500
If you are a knowledge fighter and you are within, let's say, three feet of Assad and

03:37:05.500 --> 03:37:08.800
you can light him on fire, please light him on fire.

03:37:08.800 --> 03:37:10.640
Just make him hot for a little bit.

03:37:10.640 --> 03:37:12.120
Just burn him to death.

03:37:12.120 --> 03:37:14.900
No, if you've got like a—

03:37:14.900 --> 03:37:17.960
If he survives, you're lighting him on fire.

03:37:17.960 --> 03:37:20.640
Lighting him on fire ten more times.

03:37:20.640 --> 03:37:22.120
And then meme it.

03:37:22.120 --> 03:37:23.120
So—

03:37:23.120 --> 03:37:29.480
Yeah, like the anti-CNN that memes you?

03:37:29.480 --> 03:37:31.720
Actually, Alex just paid out $20,000.

03:37:31.720 --> 03:37:32.720
All right.

03:37:32.720 --> 03:37:33.720
Kill us all.

03:37:33.720 --> 03:37:34.720
Just paid out $20,000.

03:37:34.720 --> 03:37:35.720
Just fucking.

03:37:35.720 --> 03:37:36.720
Just fucking.

03:37:36.720 --> 03:37:37.720
I'm done.

03:37:37.720 --> 03:37:38.720
What a shock.

03:37:38.720 --> 03:37:39.720
I'm done.

03:37:39.720 --> 03:37:40.720
What a shock.

03:37:40.720 --> 03:37:41.720
You know who won?

03:37:41.720 --> 03:37:42.720
Who won?

03:37:42.720 --> 03:37:43.720
Some guy that Alex Jones offered a job to.

03:37:43.720 --> 03:37:44.720
Jesus.

03:37:44.720 --> 03:37:45.720
It was that guy?

03:37:45.720 --> 03:37:46.720
Well, there are two guys.

03:37:46.720 --> 03:37:47.720
Fuck off.

03:37:47.720 --> 03:37:48.720
Two guys.

03:37:48.720 --> 03:37:49.720
Yeah.

03:37:49.720 --> 03:37:53.920
Alex Jones offered a job to the first and second place guys, but here was the fucking

03:37:53.920 --> 03:37:54.920
awesome.

03:37:54.920 --> 03:37:55.920
Like, I wish—

03:37:55.920 --> 03:37:56.920
Fuck.

03:37:56.920 --> 03:37:57.920
I'm so—

03:37:57.920 --> 03:37:59.920
I'm an idiot because I don't have the clip of this.

03:37:59.920 --> 03:38:02.200
But it's so fucking hilarious.

03:38:02.200 --> 03:38:06.840
He's sitting there and he's like, all right, I told Paul Joseph Watson he got to pick the

03:38:06.840 --> 03:38:10.480
winner and I don't think this is the winner.

03:38:10.480 --> 03:38:13.520
I think the winner is the Braveheart one.

03:38:13.520 --> 03:38:15.000
That guy's great.

03:38:15.000 --> 03:38:16.120
You got a job.

03:38:16.120 --> 03:38:17.120
Just hit me up.

03:38:17.120 --> 03:38:18.120
You got a job.

03:38:18.120 --> 03:38:19.120
Please.

03:38:19.120 --> 03:38:20.120
I want to work with you.

03:38:20.120 --> 03:38:21.120
You got a job.

03:38:21.120 --> 03:38:22.120
A guy did a Braveheart version of—

03:38:22.120 --> 03:38:23.120
You got a job.

03:38:23.120 --> 03:38:26.200
It's just Braveheart, but with Trump as William Wallace.

03:38:26.200 --> 03:38:27.720
And he's like, you got a job.

03:38:27.720 --> 03:38:33.280
No, look, I told Paul Joseph Watson he could choose the winner and he got the $20,000.

03:38:33.280 --> 03:38:34.280
It's honor bound.

03:38:34.280 --> 03:38:35.280
What did Rappaport have to do to get a job?

03:38:35.280 --> 03:38:39.720
He just cucked out the winner of the fucking contest that he started.

03:38:39.720 --> 03:38:40.720
Of course.

03:38:40.720 --> 03:38:44.440
The winner was—okay, of course it's a movie.

03:38:44.440 --> 03:38:46.440
I'm going to give you three guesses.

03:38:46.440 --> 03:38:48.680
I'm going to give you three guesses.

03:38:48.680 --> 03:38:50.680
And now consider the mythology—

03:38:50.680 --> 03:38:51.680
Gladiator.

03:38:51.680 --> 03:38:52.680
Gladiator.

03:38:52.680 --> 03:38:53.680
Gladiator.

03:38:53.680 --> 03:38:54.680
That's your first?

03:38:54.680 --> 03:38:55.680
Gladiator.

03:38:55.680 --> 03:38:56.680
No.

03:38:56.680 --> 03:38:57.680
That's also my second.

03:38:57.680 --> 03:38:58.680
Gladiator again.

03:38:58.680 --> 03:38:59.680
Consider the mythology of Infowars.

03:38:59.680 --> 03:39:00.680
Okay.

03:39:00.680 --> 03:39:01.680
How he talks about false realities.

03:39:01.680 --> 03:39:02.680
Oh, the Patriot.

03:39:02.680 --> 03:39:03.680
No.

03:39:03.680 --> 03:39:04.680
Um.

03:39:04.680 --> 03:39:05.680
You got one more.

03:39:05.680 --> 03:39:08.040
This should be obvious.

03:39:08.040 --> 03:39:09.880
All other Mel Gibson movies.

03:39:09.880 --> 03:39:10.880
No.

03:39:10.880 --> 03:39:11.880
But it should be obvious.

03:39:11.880 --> 03:39:12.880
Come on.

03:39:12.880 --> 03:39:14.840
You got this.

03:39:14.840 --> 03:39:15.840
Infowars.

03:39:15.840 --> 03:39:16.840
Um.

03:39:16.840 --> 03:39:19.840
A scanner darkly?

03:39:19.840 --> 03:39:20.840
Like I don't know.

03:39:20.840 --> 03:39:21.840
That's closer.

03:39:21.840 --> 03:39:22.840
I got nothing.

03:39:22.840 --> 03:39:23.840
Matrix.

03:39:23.840 --> 03:39:24.840
Oh, come on.

03:39:24.840 --> 03:39:25.840
No.

03:39:25.840 --> 03:39:28.120
That—you can't even—that was made by trans women.

03:39:28.120 --> 03:39:30.000
Yeah, I know.

03:39:30.000 --> 03:39:31.640
You don't get to steal that.

03:39:31.640 --> 03:39:32.640
Oh, they did.

03:39:32.640 --> 03:39:34.360
You don't get to.

03:39:34.360 --> 03:39:41.720
It's that scene where Agent Smiths are shooting at Neo down a hallway and he stops the bullets.

03:39:41.720 --> 03:39:42.720
Yeah.

03:39:42.720 --> 03:39:44.280
And all the bullets are fake news.

03:39:44.280 --> 03:39:46.480
Dives into—oh, fuck off.

03:39:46.480 --> 03:39:47.480
Yeah, it's nonsense.

03:39:47.480 --> 03:39:48.480
Jesus Christ.

03:39:48.480 --> 03:39:53.320
But he paid $20,000 and has offered both of them jobs.

03:39:53.320 --> 03:39:55.120
Have we considered doing one of those?

03:39:55.120 --> 03:39:56.120
No.

03:39:56.120 --> 03:39:57.120
I bet we could come up with a better idea.

03:39:57.120 --> 03:39:58.120
We can't play meme warfare.

03:39:58.120 --> 03:39:59.120
That's true.

03:39:59.120 --> 03:40:00.120
It's nonsense.

03:40:00.120 --> 03:40:01.120
That's true.

03:40:01.120 --> 03:40:02.600
That is a fickle, fly-by-night piece of bullshit.

03:40:02.600 --> 03:40:03.600
Yeah.

03:40:03.600 --> 03:40:06.000
We've got to get these last two clips out.

03:40:06.000 --> 03:40:07.000
We've got two—

03:40:07.000 --> 03:40:08.000
Yeah.

03:40:08.000 --> 03:40:12.040
We're on hour seven and a half.

03:40:12.040 --> 03:40:13.040
Jordan.

03:40:13.040 --> 03:40:14.040
Yes.

03:40:14.040 --> 03:40:15.040
The debate.

03:40:15.040 --> 03:40:16.040
Yes.

03:40:16.040 --> 03:40:21.800
Alex mentioned this a little bit earlier, that Trump said some good things in the debate.

03:40:21.800 --> 03:40:22.800
Right.

03:40:22.800 --> 03:40:26.200
Now, one of them was that people speak English here, not Spanish, which sucks.

03:40:26.200 --> 03:40:27.200
I didn't like that.

03:40:27.200 --> 03:40:28.200
I didn't like that.

03:40:28.200 --> 03:40:29.200
It sucks.

03:40:29.200 --> 03:40:36.240
But Trump said some other things that Alex did like, and they're not good.

03:40:36.240 --> 03:40:42.680
But I've got to say, as a litmus test, Donald Trump coming out against vaccines and saying,

03:40:42.680 --> 03:40:47.880
I've got a lot of friends and family who've got brain-damaged kids from this, shows that

03:40:47.880 --> 03:40:52.800
he really cares about people, and he knows the system's going to come after him, and

03:40:52.800 --> 03:40:54.200
he understands what's going on.

03:40:54.200 --> 03:40:57.840
And when the rubber meets the road, he doesn't want to be involved in brain damaging tens

03:40:57.840 --> 03:41:00.280
of millions of children.

03:41:00.280 --> 03:41:01.880
Which is why he's removing health care.

03:41:01.880 --> 03:41:06.680
The vaccines are linked to increased cancer, neurological disorders, autoimmune disorders.

03:41:06.680 --> 03:41:09.320
It says it on the stinking inserts.

03:41:09.320 --> 03:41:17.840
And Ben Carson, a medical doctor, a brain surgeon, not an epidemiologist, not a virologist,

03:41:17.840 --> 03:41:22.600
he just sits there and says it's wonderful because he's a good guy as a doctor, so he

03:41:22.600 --> 03:41:24.560
believes everything they're doing must be wonderful.

03:41:24.560 --> 03:41:30.040
I like you making fun of his doctorate when you're also not a doctor.

03:41:30.040 --> 03:41:41.760
But that, in the debate, Trump talked about how when he had kids, he spaced out the vaccines.

03:41:41.760 --> 03:41:43.240
Because he thought that like...

03:41:43.240 --> 03:41:45.280
That's the argument that I've heard a bunch recently.

03:41:45.280 --> 03:41:49.200
If they get that full vaccine, it's a horse tranquilizer.

03:41:49.200 --> 03:41:54.120
It's a huge horse needle, which isn't true at all.

03:41:54.120 --> 03:42:00.040
And then I don't want to put too fine a point on this, and we're already four hours into

03:42:00.040 --> 03:42:06.560
this podcast, but I have looked into all of it and all of the anti-vax stuff.

03:42:06.560 --> 03:42:07.560
It's bullshit.

03:42:07.560 --> 03:42:08.560
It's all bullshit.

03:42:08.560 --> 03:42:09.800
It's absolutely nonsense.

03:42:09.800 --> 03:42:15.080
It's been bullshit since the 1890s.

03:42:15.080 --> 03:42:21.600
Since vaccines were created, one guy got a fucking thing happened to him within two weeks

03:42:21.600 --> 03:42:24.720
of a vaccine, and he was like, well, it's vaccines.

03:42:24.720 --> 03:42:26.240
It is always bullshit.

03:42:26.240 --> 03:42:28.720
It is always fucking bullshit.

03:42:28.720 --> 03:42:36.600
I can't begin to deal with how much I hate you if you're an anti-vaxxer.

03:42:36.600 --> 03:42:43.060
All of it is sussed out legitimately by one sentence that is one of the most important

03:42:43.060 --> 03:42:51.480
sentences in terms of statistics, and that is that correlation does not imply causation.

03:42:51.480 --> 03:42:57.200
If there is something that there is a slight relation to, you can't say just because there's

03:42:57.200 --> 03:43:00.760
a relation that X caused Y.

03:43:00.760 --> 03:43:01.760
You can't.

03:43:01.760 --> 03:43:02.760
That's science.

03:43:02.760 --> 03:43:06.840
Correlation does not equal causation is the bane of our existence.

03:43:06.840 --> 03:43:12.320
The fact that it is true and the fact that it is almost impossible for most people to

03:43:12.320 --> 03:43:18.680
recognize is the most destructive force, I don't know, in my lifetime.

03:43:18.680 --> 03:43:25.880
One of the biggest cases about this, and Alex Jones talks about, like in the UK, the guy

03:43:25.880 --> 03:43:30.040
who did studies about vaccines- It was the Dred Scott case, right?

03:43:30.040 --> 03:43:31.040
No.

03:43:31.040 --> 03:43:37.000
It was this guy named Andrew Wakefield, and he did some studies that were called into

03:43:37.000 --> 03:43:45.800
question and he got fired because it turned out he was taking a ton of money from lawyers

03:43:45.800 --> 03:43:50.480
that were discredited and his license was revoked.

03:43:50.480 --> 03:43:56.920
There were lawyers who were trying to get a class action lawsuit going on behalf of

03:43:56.920 --> 03:44:04.080
people who hated vaccines, and he got like $400,000 from those lawyers.

03:44:04.080 --> 03:44:10.520
And so all of his studies, people who signed onto his studies in the past not knowing that

03:44:10.520 --> 03:44:16.000
monetary payment, who were involved, they were like, oh shit.

03:44:16.000 --> 03:44:17.000
Wait.

03:44:17.000 --> 03:44:18.000
Hold on a second.

03:44:18.000 --> 03:44:23.880
Are you saying that when you get money involved with healthcare, bad things happen?

03:44:23.880 --> 03:44:24.880
Especially with studies.

03:44:24.880 --> 03:44:25.880
Nah.

03:44:25.880 --> 03:44:26.880
Can't believe it.

03:44:26.880 --> 03:44:29.440
Especially when conclusions are- Capitalism!

03:44:29.440 --> 03:44:30.480
Free market!

03:44:30.480 --> 03:44:32.480
Free market, baby.

03:44:32.480 --> 03:44:33.480
Guns!

03:44:33.480 --> 03:44:34.480
Prosperity.

03:44:34.480 --> 03:44:35.480
Prosperity.

03:44:35.480 --> 03:44:42.480
Anyway, Alex is pretty thrilled with that anti-vax message.

03:44:42.480 --> 03:44:49.480
But I honestly think, if I can be totally clear, I think that no matter what happened

03:44:49.480 --> 03:44:53.600
in that debate, Alex would find something to love.

03:44:53.600 --> 03:44:54.600
About Trump?

03:44:54.600 --> 03:44:55.600
Yeah.

03:44:55.600 --> 03:44:56.600
You think so?

03:44:56.600 --> 03:44:57.600
Yeah.

03:44:57.600 --> 03:44:58.600
I think it's in his timeline.

03:44:58.600 --> 03:45:00.520
So you think this is the money situation again?

03:45:00.520 --> 03:45:01.520
I do.

03:45:01.520 --> 03:45:05.760
So he fixated on one thing that Trump said.

03:45:05.760 --> 03:45:08.600
Like now I kind of want to go back- Can I tell you why?

03:45:08.600 --> 03:45:13.520
I would rather die, but I kind of want to go back and watch that debate to see how many

03:45:13.520 --> 03:45:18.880
things Trump said that he would have disagreed with versus how many he did agree with.

03:45:18.880 --> 03:45:19.880
I have no idea.

03:45:19.880 --> 03:45:20.880
Right?

03:45:20.880 --> 03:45:28.080
But I did go back and look into Trump's anti-vax history, and he got in some fucking hot water

03:45:28.080 --> 03:45:32.360
like three months before this for anti-vax stuff.

03:45:32.360 --> 03:45:36.920
And he has an anti-vax history that goes back to like 2005.

03:45:36.920 --> 03:45:43.000
Oh, so it's a full-on birther kind of situation where it's been there from the beginning.

03:45:43.000 --> 03:45:44.000
This isn't news.

03:45:44.000 --> 03:45:46.760
This is just he said it at a debate.

03:45:46.760 --> 03:45:47.760
Right.

03:45:47.760 --> 03:45:51.800
And so Alex Jones' position is like, he's going to be attacked for this, but he had

03:45:51.800 --> 03:45:53.900
been attacked for it already.

03:45:53.900 --> 03:45:58.800
He's pretending that this is some sort of like new wrinkle in his character, which it's

03:45:58.800 --> 03:45:59.800
not.

03:45:59.800 --> 03:46:03.520
I honestly think- Well, I mean in the context of his campaign,

03:46:03.520 --> 03:46:04.960
has this been a thing?

03:46:04.960 --> 03:46:06.800
No, I don't think this has been.

03:46:06.800 --> 03:46:08.920
He's been too busy complaining about immigrants, though.

03:46:08.920 --> 03:46:15.080
Well, and in the same way that in his campaign, it hasn't been all about birtherism, you know?

03:46:15.080 --> 03:46:18.920
It hasn't been all about- Hey, he didn't start that.

03:46:18.920 --> 03:46:20.920
He stopped it.

03:46:20.920 --> 03:46:28.560
Yeah, so I think that there's a little bit of manipulation going on.

03:46:28.560 --> 03:46:29.560
Yeah.

03:46:29.560 --> 03:46:30.560
A little bit.

03:46:30.560 --> 03:46:33.920
And if Alex Jones, like- At the very least.

03:46:33.920 --> 03:46:40.880
In terms of our show, this is maybe four episodes back, but Alex Jones, when he made his pivot

03:46:40.880 --> 03:46:47.580
to stop talking shit about Trump in terms of his mob ties, he said, I went back and

03:46:47.580 --> 03:46:49.480
I did deep research on him.

03:46:49.480 --> 03:46:50.480
Bullshit.

03:46:50.480 --> 03:46:56.320
He watched all his speeches, and if he had done that, he would already know that he has

03:46:56.320 --> 03:46:59.560
a history of being an anti-vaccination guy.

03:46:59.560 --> 03:47:03.320
He hasn't been not that for years.

03:47:03.320 --> 03:47:06.380
So this shouldn't be news to him.

03:47:06.380 --> 03:47:10.480
Such a luxury for rich people to be anti-vax.

03:47:10.480 --> 03:47:11.680
Such a luxury.

03:47:11.680 --> 03:47:12.680
Yeah.

03:47:12.680 --> 03:47:18.560
Oh, my kids go to all schools where everybody has been vaccinated, so I don't have to worry

03:47:18.560 --> 03:47:19.560
about it.

03:47:19.560 --> 03:47:20.560
They're not pregnant.

03:47:20.560 --> 03:47:28.240
Also, this version of anti-vax, where it's like, I spaced it out over six years.

03:47:28.240 --> 03:47:29.240
Fucking fuck you.

03:47:29.240 --> 03:47:30.240
Yeah, it's not great either.

03:47:30.240 --> 03:47:32.240
Fuck you.

03:47:32.240 --> 03:47:43.460
I've established it, I think, pretty consistently, but if you're anti-vax, I hope you kill yourself

03:47:43.460 --> 03:47:46.120
and then kill your children.

03:47:46.120 --> 03:47:47.120
That seems hard.

03:47:47.120 --> 03:47:48.920
No, that's a good order for that.

03:47:48.920 --> 03:47:52.840
All right, well, we all know that our descendants are still with us.

03:47:52.840 --> 03:48:01.360
We got one more clip, and this is Alex talking more about Trump's anti-vax position.

03:48:01.360 --> 03:48:06.280
What I know about what he's going to be going through now for saying that, and looking at

03:48:06.280 --> 03:48:09.960
the look in his eye, I guarantee you Donald Trump doesn't like seeing his friends have

03:48:09.960 --> 03:48:12.040
brain-damaged kids all around him.

03:48:12.040 --> 03:48:17.680
It's a large portion of people have giggling, happy 18-month-old baby boys.

03:48:17.680 --> 03:48:20.000
Their blood-brain barrier is not strong as a girl's.

03:48:20.000 --> 03:48:22.160
They go in to get that last round of shots.

03:48:22.160 --> 03:48:24.720
Billy don't ever talk again.

03:48:24.720 --> 03:48:30.440
That's why a lot of members of Congress are against vaccines, because you or your kid

03:48:30.440 --> 03:48:35.120
or your grandchildren take a shot and never talk again, that'll wake some people up.

03:48:35.120 --> 03:48:42.560
So I got to say it, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, and Donald Trump, they are the three presidential

03:48:42.560 --> 03:48:45.800
contenders, in my view, from a position of liberty.

03:48:45.800 --> 03:48:49.120
Now we have come to our own new place.

03:48:49.120 --> 03:48:51.680
Yeah, we've narrowed it down.

03:48:51.680 --> 03:48:53.120
And that's fucked up.

03:48:53.120 --> 03:48:54.120
Yeah.

03:48:54.120 --> 03:48:55.400
Because he loves Rand Paul.

03:48:55.400 --> 03:49:05.280
He will very soon humiliate Ted Cruz, and he will become the biggest blowjob machine

03:49:05.280 --> 03:49:06.720
for Donald Trump.

03:49:06.720 --> 03:49:07.940
Which is funny.

03:49:07.940 --> 03:49:08.940
But this-

03:49:08.940 --> 03:49:14.040
That is the one true joy I took out of that campaign, is Ted Cruz turning into a little

03:49:14.040 --> 03:49:15.040
bitch.

03:49:15.040 --> 03:49:25.960
Uh, this is, like, I don't know how to say it, I was right.

03:49:25.960 --> 03:49:26.960
My argument-

03:49:26.960 --> 03:49:32.640
So what you're saying is that we began this episode with Dan being right, and we ended

03:49:32.640 --> 03:49:34.400
it with Dan being right.

03:49:34.400 --> 03:49:38.920
I think I'm right, but not the way I expected.

03:49:38.920 --> 03:49:46.080
Because I predicted earlier that when Alex makes his pivot to Trump, it will be superficial.

03:49:46.080 --> 03:49:53.000
It'll be about some issue that he already, it's not new.

03:49:53.000 --> 03:49:54.000
It's not new.

03:49:54.000 --> 03:49:55.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:49:55.000 --> 03:49:56.960
And that is what he has sort of done.

03:49:56.960 --> 03:49:59.120
Now he's not the cheerleader yet.

03:49:59.120 --> 03:50:03.480
He's still just saying these three guys are liberty candidates.

03:50:03.480 --> 03:50:04.800
He's narrowed it down.

03:50:04.800 --> 03:50:05.800
Yeah.

03:50:05.800 --> 03:50:06.800
Which is-

03:50:06.800 --> 03:50:09.720
Which is already fucked up enough as it is.

03:50:09.720 --> 03:50:22.320
Like the candidate, I don't understand how it is that he professes to be libertarian,

03:50:22.320 --> 03:50:25.680
and theoretically non-partisan.

03:50:25.680 --> 03:50:30.740
And yet at the same time, every enemy is leftist.

03:50:30.740 --> 03:50:34.800
Every fear comes from inclusion.

03:50:34.800 --> 03:50:43.560
Every fear comes from any kind of, we should all be part of the same world, which is also

03:50:43.560 --> 03:50:50.720
his professed ideology in that the globalists are trying to keep us from becoming an inclusive

03:50:50.720 --> 03:50:51.720
society.

03:50:51.720 --> 03:50:57.440
He wants the inclusion, but he knows that it's a globalist plot.

03:50:57.440 --> 03:51:02.960
He's talked about Sanders a couple times already, and he's been like, this fucking ding-dong,

03:51:02.960 --> 03:51:05.000
this asshole.

03:51:05.000 --> 03:51:14.200
Which, to me, it seems like he would wind up coming down between Sanders and Rand Paul.

03:51:14.200 --> 03:51:15.960
That's what Jesse Ventura does.

03:51:15.960 --> 03:51:16.960
Exactly, exactly.

03:51:16.960 --> 03:51:17.960
Because Jesse Ventura is pure.

03:51:17.960 --> 03:51:22.080
Ventura is like, hey, Sanders or Rand Paul.

03:51:22.080 --> 03:51:23.480
That's what Ventura is.

03:51:23.480 --> 03:51:25.080
Jesse Ventura has a philosophy.

03:51:25.080 --> 03:51:32.720
He has an ideological consistency, and Alex doesn't believe really in anything.

03:51:32.720 --> 03:51:39.480
I honestly think what we're coming to, and what I've learned from listening to these

03:51:39.480 --> 03:51:49.760
past three weeks or two weeks that we've covered, is he is a harsh, opportunistic asshole.

03:51:49.760 --> 03:51:52.920
He wants his money.

03:51:52.920 --> 03:51:54.120
He wants his money.

03:51:54.120 --> 03:51:57.480
And I think he realized when Joe Biggs...

03:51:57.480 --> 03:52:03.360
That's actually gonna be, when we write the screenplay for our documentary, it will be

03:52:03.360 --> 03:52:06.160
the tagline is, Alex Jones.

03:52:06.160 --> 03:52:07.160
He wants his money.

03:52:07.160 --> 03:52:12.320
Well, we predicted earlier that it would be a thing where it's like, he's trying to get

03:52:12.320 --> 03:52:17.160
the Mercers or Trump to try and come in as big money donors.

03:52:17.160 --> 03:52:19.560
And that may still be the case.

03:52:19.560 --> 03:52:26.160
But I think he started this million dollar campaign, and he's like, it's not happening.

03:52:26.160 --> 03:52:32.720
In the meantime, we've recognized Joe Biggs went out there and everyone wanted that shirt.

03:52:32.720 --> 03:52:35.800
That is a market we can fucking tap into.

03:52:35.800 --> 03:52:38.240
How do we rationalize this?

03:52:38.240 --> 03:52:39.760
We rationalize it.

03:52:39.760 --> 03:52:41.840
There was a debate last night.

03:52:41.840 --> 03:52:46.200
He said something anti-vaccination that he said a hundred times already.

03:52:46.200 --> 03:52:51.220
Now it's like, fuck, we soft kill babies.

03:52:51.220 --> 03:52:52.560
He's against that.

03:52:52.560 --> 03:52:55.760
All right, I'm in.

03:52:55.760 --> 03:52:56.760
Exactly.

03:52:56.760 --> 03:52:57.760
That's so disappointing.

03:52:57.760 --> 03:53:01.680
I want it to be some kind of nefarious thing.

03:53:01.680 --> 03:53:03.680
It's still nefarious.

03:53:03.680 --> 03:53:05.160
It's still pretty nefarious.

03:53:05.160 --> 03:53:06.320
That's a good point.

03:53:06.320 --> 03:53:19.880
It needs, to me, in order for us to, I don't know, I guess it's more like I feel like we

03:53:19.880 --> 03:53:22.800
need a scoop.

03:53:22.800 --> 03:53:28.440
I feel like we need some kind of angle that nobody's ever touched before.

03:53:28.440 --> 03:53:37.280
But if it just winds up being weird, shitty opportunism, it bums me out, right?

03:53:37.280 --> 03:53:39.560
Shouldn't there be some sort of Mercer money?

03:53:39.560 --> 03:53:44.960
Shouldn't there be some sort of third party donor who's like, all right, now I direct

03:53:44.960 --> 03:53:45.960
things.

03:53:45.960 --> 03:53:49.160
It used to be the gold guy, but now it's me.

03:53:49.160 --> 03:53:53.480
Well Ted Anderson is involved to this day, so that he hasn't gone.

03:53:53.480 --> 03:53:57.240
I mean, gold guys are always going to be around.

03:53:57.240 --> 03:54:04.380
I would say that you should take solace in knowing that no one has done as much listening

03:54:04.380 --> 03:54:07.720
to his show as we have.

03:54:07.720 --> 03:54:10.560
I don't take solace in that at all.

03:54:10.560 --> 03:54:14.640
But we do have a scoop, whatever the case is.

03:54:14.640 --> 03:54:15.640
That's true.

03:54:15.640 --> 03:54:20.680
There's no reason that the Mercers are the ones who did it, or Trump money.

03:54:20.680 --> 03:54:28.760
There's still a scoop here, because he didn't fucking care about Trump two days before,

03:54:28.760 --> 03:54:30.880
and now he's a fucking contender.

03:54:30.880 --> 03:54:35.000
Right back on an anti-vaxxer situation.

03:54:35.000 --> 03:54:44.400
He's all over the place, and when he becomes the 1776 2.0 guy.

03:54:44.400 --> 03:54:51.480
It's not just going to become, it's not because of things Trump said five years ago.

03:54:51.480 --> 03:54:57.240
Well that's the thing that gets me, is that it seems like right now he's going off of

03:54:57.240 --> 03:55:00.040
things Trump says.

03:55:00.040 --> 03:55:05.140
Like he's going off of things that Trump, like Trump says something I like, so I say

03:55:05.140 --> 03:55:06.800
nice things about him.

03:55:06.800 --> 03:55:10.140
Trump says something I don't like, so I don't say nice things about him.

03:55:10.140 --> 03:55:11.400
Trump says something I like.

03:55:11.400 --> 03:55:14.320
Like that's the problem that I have.

03:55:14.320 --> 03:55:22.360
It should be something that is at least consistent, and until we get to that consistent point,

03:55:22.360 --> 03:55:24.320
it just seems like he's full of shit.

03:55:24.320 --> 03:55:25.920
Yeah, you're a dumb-dumb.

03:55:25.920 --> 03:55:27.240
There's never going to be- Fair.

03:55:27.240 --> 03:55:28.240
There's never going to- Fair.

03:55:28.240 --> 03:55:30.880
No, that's fair.

03:55:30.880 --> 03:55:34.240
There's never going to be a point when Alex Jones is consistent.

03:55:34.240 --> 03:55:35.240
Fair.

03:55:35.240 --> 03:55:36.560
Yeah, he's a crazy person.

03:55:36.560 --> 03:55:38.800
I don't know why, but I still- He has brain damage.

03:55:38.800 --> 03:55:42.840
I still live in this world of like- He did mess.

03:55:42.840 --> 03:55:49.920
I still live in the world of I believe people believe in things, and Alex doesn't.

03:55:49.920 --> 03:55:53.080
You know what- And that's why you're right about that fucking

03:55:53.080 --> 03:56:02.960
meme is that the consistent argument is always people believe shit, and Alex doesn't have

03:56:02.960 --> 03:56:04.200
a belief system.

03:56:04.200 --> 03:56:05.200
Nope.

03:56:05.200 --> 03:56:09.520
Alex has elves, and then we move on.

03:56:09.520 --> 03:56:10.680
He's rogue.

03:56:10.680 --> 03:56:11.960
He's completely rogue.

03:56:11.960 --> 03:56:14.720
Yeah, as are all of those fucking alt-right guys.

03:56:14.720 --> 03:56:15.840
It doesn't matter to them.

03:56:15.840 --> 03:56:17.240
They move on.

03:56:17.240 --> 03:56:24.480
In the same way that in that story that Tom Arnold told, they got to get a bunch of publicity

03:56:24.480 --> 03:56:30.520
out of calling Tom Arnold a pussy and then canceling the fight, and no one on their side

03:56:30.520 --> 03:56:32.460
knows that they canceled the fight.

03:56:32.460 --> 03:56:33.680
It just didn't happen.

03:56:33.680 --> 03:56:36.120
They can say he backed out.

03:56:36.120 --> 03:56:39.040
He was involved with the coordination of it.

03:56:39.040 --> 03:56:40.040
Yeah.

03:56:40.040 --> 03:56:41.040
It doesn't matter.

03:56:41.040 --> 03:56:42.040
It doesn't matter.

03:56:42.040 --> 03:56:43.040
Perception is king.

03:56:43.040 --> 03:56:44.040
Yeah.

03:56:44.040 --> 03:56:45.040
All of it's bullshit.

03:56:45.040 --> 03:56:46.040
Everything is bullshit.

03:56:46.040 --> 03:56:52.800
Anyway, we'll be back with the next stage of this investigation and other shit.

03:56:52.800 --> 03:56:54.960
I don't want to talk about the present much, but-

03:56:54.960 --> 03:57:02.160
Unless the present turns out to be very interesting, which so far to this circumstance it has been

03:57:02.160 --> 03:57:03.160
very depressing.

03:57:03.160 --> 03:57:06.600
Well, it's just like he doesn't talk about the actual things that are happening in the

03:57:06.600 --> 03:57:07.600
administration.

03:57:07.600 --> 03:57:08.600
No, it's been boring.

03:57:08.600 --> 03:57:09.600
Yeah.

03:57:09.600 --> 03:57:15.720
It's like, oh, Scaramucci's in, hey, that's because Sean Spicer was a deep state agent.

03:57:15.720 --> 03:57:20.440
It would be really interesting though if he did get into, like if he did have sources

03:57:20.440 --> 03:57:28.280
like Donald Trump Jr., who would get him inside information on how the dynamics of the administration

03:57:28.280 --> 03:57:29.280
was working.

03:57:29.280 --> 03:57:31.560
Which, by the way, this week-

03:57:31.560 --> 03:57:32.560
Bananas.

03:57:32.560 --> 03:57:41.720
Like this week, as this episode comes out, Jr. may have to show up in front of the Senate.

03:57:41.720 --> 03:57:43.720
As will DT himself.

03:57:43.720 --> 03:57:44.720
Manafort.

03:57:44.720 --> 03:57:45.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:57:45.840 --> 03:57:46.840
So we'll see.

03:57:46.840 --> 03:57:47.840
I mean, they're probably-

03:57:47.840 --> 03:57:48.840
They won't.

03:57:48.840 --> 03:57:49.840
No.

03:57:49.840 --> 03:57:50.840
Of course not.

03:57:50.840 --> 03:57:51.840
No.

03:57:51.840 --> 03:57:52.840
They're going to be pardoned.

03:57:52.840 --> 03:57:53.840
It's nonsense.

03:57:53.840 --> 03:57:54.840
You get it?

03:57:54.840 --> 03:57:55.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:57:55.840 --> 03:57:57.840
But hey, if you don't want to be pardoned, you should go to our website.

03:57:57.840 --> 03:57:58.840
What?

03:57:58.840 --> 03:57:59.840
Wait, no, no.

03:57:59.840 --> 03:58:00.840
No.

03:58:00.840 --> 03:58:02.400
I refuse that transition.

03:58:02.400 --> 03:58:03.400
Reject.

03:58:03.400 --> 03:58:04.400
Nope.

03:58:04.400 --> 03:58:05.400
That was me.

03:58:05.400 --> 03:58:06.400
Reject entirely.

03:58:06.400 --> 03:58:07.400
It was me slightly buzzed.

03:58:07.400 --> 03:58:08.400
I pivoted on the word.

03:58:08.400 --> 03:58:09.400
Reject entirely.

03:58:09.400 --> 03:58:15.200
If you want to reject something on a word, go to our website.

03:58:15.200 --> 03:58:17.440
Our website is knowledgefight.com.

03:58:17.440 --> 03:58:18.440
Check it out.

03:58:18.440 --> 03:58:19.580
There's a lot of good stuff on there.

03:58:19.580 --> 03:58:22.800
You can click on a button that says support the show.

03:58:22.800 --> 03:58:24.060
And let me tell you something.

03:58:24.060 --> 03:58:27.640
So many people have started supporting the show that it's-

03:58:27.640 --> 03:58:28.840
We got a lot of wonks.

03:58:28.840 --> 03:58:31.200
It's kind of mind boggling.

03:58:31.200 --> 03:58:33.200
How many of you have become policy wonks and how-

03:58:33.200 --> 03:58:34.320
Thank you all so much.

03:58:34.320 --> 03:58:37.720
How important it is to us on so many levels.

03:58:37.720 --> 03:58:43.000
And if you are not a policy wonk and you would like to be, click on that button and you will

03:58:43.000 --> 03:58:44.000
be-

03:58:44.000 --> 03:58:45.000
Kill Jeff Sessions.

03:58:45.000 --> 03:58:46.000
Wait, hold on.

03:58:46.000 --> 03:58:47.000
Wait, no.

03:58:47.000 --> 03:58:48.000
Wait.

03:58:48.000 --> 03:58:49.000
What?

03:58:49.000 --> 03:58:50.000
Hold off on that.

03:58:50.000 --> 03:58:51.000
Did we not agree on that?

03:58:51.000 --> 03:58:52.000
Hold off on that.

03:58:52.000 --> 03:58:53.000
Did we not agree on that pre-show?

03:58:53.000 --> 03:58:54.000
You are not on brand.

03:58:54.000 --> 03:58:55.000
Okay.

03:58:55.000 --> 03:58:56.000
All right.

03:58:56.000 --> 03:58:57.000
I'm sorry.

03:58:57.000 --> 03:58:58.000
I'm sorry.

03:58:58.000 --> 03:58:59.000
But if you click on that button, you will be granted access to, right now it's 10 episodes

03:58:59.000 --> 03:59:00.000
of That's What They Want You To Think.

03:59:00.000 --> 03:59:03.260
And if you're watching this on the Marty DeRosa's Conspiracy Theory podcast, a little bonus

03:59:03.260 --> 03:59:04.260
for your ass.

03:59:04.260 --> 03:59:07.040
Marty, friend of the show and very, very funny comedian.

03:59:07.040 --> 03:59:11.500
And there are other episodes that will be added eventually once I find them in my hard

03:59:11.500 --> 03:59:12.500
drive.

03:59:12.500 --> 03:59:16.360
I have an external hard drive that has other episodes that I can't find.

03:59:16.360 --> 03:59:17.360
Right.

03:59:17.360 --> 03:59:18.360
But they're there somewhere.

03:59:18.360 --> 03:59:19.360
We'll figure it out.

03:59:19.360 --> 03:59:20.360
But if you-

03:59:20.360 --> 03:59:23.720
If you want to follow us on Twitter, it's at knowledge underscore fights.

03:59:23.720 --> 03:59:24.720
And we're on Facebook.

03:59:24.720 --> 03:59:25.720
Facebook.

03:59:25.720 --> 03:59:30.520
All right, this is the evidence that we've been drinking wine this entire episode.

03:59:30.520 --> 03:59:31.520
I did that last episode.

03:59:31.520 --> 03:59:32.680
You don't even remember it.

03:59:32.680 --> 03:59:33.680
That's a good point.

03:59:33.680 --> 03:59:36.640
That's because we've been drinking wine this entire episode.

03:59:36.640 --> 03:59:38.320
Please give us a rating on Facebook.

03:59:38.320 --> 03:59:39.320
Like us.

03:59:39.320 --> 03:59:40.320
It's helpful.

03:59:40.320 --> 03:59:41.320
Good iTunes.

03:59:41.320 --> 03:59:42.320
Give us a rating.

03:59:42.320 --> 03:59:44.040
Make sure people know us.

03:59:44.040 --> 03:59:49.000
There's something about their algorithm where if you give us some stars, they'll be like,

03:59:49.000 --> 03:59:50.680
yeah, fucking find them.

03:59:50.680 --> 03:59:51.680
Indeed.

03:59:51.680 --> 03:59:52.800
Beyond that, I'd like to apologize.

03:59:52.800 --> 03:59:54.720
This episode has been this long.

03:59:54.720 --> 03:59:55.720
Jesus Christ.

03:59:55.720 --> 03:59:56.720
I think we-

03:59:56.720 --> 03:59:57.720
How long has it been?

03:59:57.720 --> 03:59:58.720
We are at four hours.

03:59:58.720 --> 04:00:01.200
This is the longest episode so far.

04:00:01.200 --> 04:00:02.200
Not true.

04:00:02.200 --> 04:00:03.200
Jesus Christ.

04:00:03.200 --> 04:00:04.200
Yes, it is.

04:00:04.200 --> 04:00:05.200
Really?

04:00:05.200 --> 04:00:06.200
Yeah.

04:00:06.200 --> 04:00:07.200
We've not breached four hours.

04:00:07.200 --> 04:00:08.200
You've not breached four?

04:00:08.200 --> 04:00:09.200
No.

04:00:09.200 --> 04:00:10.200
Dude, you-

04:00:10.200 --> 04:00:11.200
The Joe Rogan was the closest, I think.

04:00:11.200 --> 04:00:12.200
You called it-

04:00:12.200 --> 04:00:13.200
It's close.

04:00:13.200 --> 04:00:14.760
You called it 3.15 and I was like, nah, this ain't happening.

04:00:14.760 --> 04:00:15.880
It's coming to four.

04:00:15.880 --> 04:00:19.120
I think if you had not disrupted me so many times-

04:00:19.120 --> 04:00:21.120
No.

04:00:21.120 --> 04:00:24.320
Don't-

04:00:24.320 --> 04:00:28.720
Don't pretend this wasn't on purpose.

04:00:28.720 --> 04:00:32.120
I was going to make this episode four hours no matter what happened.

04:00:32.120 --> 04:00:36.680
Look, it's the wine, it's the good times, and it's the truth, guys.

04:00:36.680 --> 04:00:37.680
Policy wonks.

04:00:37.680 --> 04:00:39.240
We love you all very much.

04:00:39.240 --> 04:00:40.240
We don't love-

04:00:40.240 --> 04:00:41.240
I'll tell you there's somebody we don't love.

04:00:41.240 --> 04:00:42.240
God damn it.

04:00:42.240 --> 04:00:43.240
Damn it.

04:00:43.240 --> 04:00:44.240
Damn.

04:00:44.240 --> 04:00:45.240
You are ruining the ending bit.

04:00:45.240 --> 04:00:46.240
I was trying to help.

04:00:46.240 --> 04:00:47.240
I was trying to help you asshole.

04:00:47.240 --> 04:00:48.240
You asshole.

04:00:48.240 --> 04:00:49.240
I was trying to help you asshole.

04:00:49.240 --> 04:00:58.160
I was trying to be like, oh shit, there's an inroad to get to John Rappaport.

04:00:58.160 --> 04:01:00.040
Do you know who doesn't help us?

04:01:00.040 --> 04:01:01.200
This one guy.

04:01:01.200 --> 04:01:02.200
What one guy?

04:01:02.200 --> 04:01:03.200
This one guy.

04:01:03.200 --> 04:01:04.200
Who is he?

04:01:04.200 --> 04:01:05.200
Fuck.

04:01:05.200 --> 04:01:06.200
I ran into the-

04:01:06.200 --> 04:01:07.200
Is he young or is he old?

04:01:07.200 --> 04:01:08.200
He's really old.

04:01:08.200 --> 04:01:09.200
He's really old?

04:01:09.200 --> 04:01:10.800
I was at this fucking anti-AIDS conference.

04:01:10.800 --> 04:01:12.800
I was at this conference about how AIDS isn't real.

04:01:12.800 --> 04:01:13.800
I'm already out.

04:01:13.800 --> 04:01:14.800
I hung out with him.

04:01:14.800 --> 04:01:15.800
He was really cool.

04:01:15.800 --> 04:01:16.800
We did shots of JMo.

04:01:16.800 --> 04:01:17.800
It was super cool.

04:01:17.800 --> 04:01:18.800
What about him?

04:01:18.800 --> 04:01:22.320
At the end of the night, I gotta be honest, I skipped out on his tab.

04:01:22.320 --> 04:01:24.600
This is the best the bit has gone so far.

04:01:24.600 --> 04:01:27.120
I skipped out on his tab.

04:01:27.120 --> 04:01:28.480
He said he was going to the bathroom.

04:01:28.480 --> 04:01:32.240
I was like, I'll stick around here.

04:01:32.240 --> 04:01:33.240
What did you say about this guy?

04:01:33.240 --> 04:01:35.480
I said, fuck you John Rappaport.

04:01:35.480 --> 04:01:36.480
Andy in Kansas.

04:01:36.480 --> 04:01:37.480
You're on the air.

04:01:37.480 --> 04:01:38.480
Thanks for holding.

04:01:38.480 --> 04:01:39.480
Hello Alex.

04:01:39.480 --> 04:01:40.480
I'm a first time caller.

04:01:40.480 --> 04:01:41.480
I'm a huge fan.

04:01:41.480 --> 04:01:42.480
I love your work.

04:01:42.480 --> 04:01:49.480
I love you.
