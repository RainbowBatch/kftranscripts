1
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:12,234
Not.

2
00:00:12,332 --> 00:00:13,470
Knowledge fights.

3
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,194
Dan and Jordan.

4
00:00:17,242 --> 00:00:20,382
I am sweating knowledgebuddy.com.

5
00:00:20,456 --> 00:00:21,490
It's time to pray.

6
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,850
I have great respect for knowledge.

7
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,402
I'm sick of them posing as if they're good guys.

8
00:00:27,476 --> 00:00:27,814
Shang.

9
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:29,240
We are the bad guys.

10
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,240
Knowledgefight.com.

11
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,166
I love you, everybody.

12
00:01:00,288 --> 00:01:01,162
Welcome back, knowledge fight.

13
00:01:01,176 --> 00:01:01,514
I'm Dan.

14
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:02,042
I'm George.

15
00:01:02,066 --> 00:01:06,674
We're a couple of dudes like to sit around worship at the altar of Celine and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

16
00:01:06,722 --> 00:01:07,954
Oh, indeed we are.

17
00:01:07,992 --> 00:01:10,558
Dan, Jordan, quick question for you.

18
00:01:10,644 --> 00:01:18,658
What's your bright spot today? My bright spot today is uh oh, what am I doing? I don't know.

19
00:01:18,744 --> 00:01:24,622
Is it a morning showing? That is what this has become.

20
00:01:24,816 --> 00:01:27,554
Delightful week of celebration.

21
00:01:27,662 --> 00:01:28,138
I don't know.

22
00:01:28,164 --> 00:01:28,706
Celebrations.

23
00:01:28,778 --> 00:01:29,650
Celebrations.

24
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:37,670
Yeah, you can't celebrate a sneak, can you? So we have the interview with reliable sources.

25
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:38,950
Brian Stelton.

26
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:46,094
Monday, we have the world exclusive interview with the lawyers, wife Bankston and Bill Ogden.

27
00:01:46,142 --> 00:01:47,640
So funny that we do.

28
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,594
Then Becca Lewis on Tuesday.

29
00:01:50,702 --> 00:01:55,270
But in order for Sneak Week to really be sneaky, sure, there has to be a day where nothing happens.

30
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,542
There has to be a day where nothing to surprise you expect shows the whole week.

31
00:01:59,556 --> 00:01:59,914
Absolutely.

32
00:02:00,012 --> 00:02:03,914
No, we sneaked, we snuck, and we didn't have something on Wednesday.

33
00:02:03,962 --> 00:02:08,018
And do you know what else? When people think we zagged, that's when we're going to Zog, baby.

34
00:02:08,054 --> 00:02:13,462
See, I know that that is a quote from News radio, but I worry because Zog means Zionist occupied government.

35
00:02:13,536 --> 00:02:17,714
Okay, well, yes, that Jimmy James has been ruined.

36
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,546
Yes, there is a different issue.

37
00:02:19,728 --> 00:02:20,494
Yeah, that's true.

38
00:02:20,532 --> 00:02:23,566
So have to put an embargo on that.

39
00:02:23,688 --> 00:02:24,360
Yes.

40
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,354
So Thursday.

41
00:02:26,402 --> 00:02:26,818
Here we are.

42
00:02:26,844 --> 00:02:34,666
Today we're beginning a two parter about the trial time and getting up to speed on a lot of that stuff.

43
00:02:34,728 --> 00:02:34,990
Right.

44
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,706
And then Friday, we cap off Sneak Week with an appearance on the Majority report.

45
00:02:39,768 --> 00:02:40,390
Oh, my God.

46
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,698
What do we say on Cedar? We're so silly.

47
00:02:42,854 --> 00:02:43,282
Yeah.

48
00:02:43,356 --> 00:02:45,682
Long time coming, I think maybe.

49
00:02:45,756 --> 00:02:46,726
I don't know.

50
00:02:46,908 --> 00:02:49,020
I've been looking forward to that.

51
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:58,102
I have been a big fan of Sam and his work, and so, yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

52
00:02:58,116 --> 00:02:59,770
I'm really excited about each week.

53
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,298
Absolutely.

54
00:03:00,384 --> 00:03:00,934
What a week.

55
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:04,380
I'm going to sing septopus to Sam the entire time.

56
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,098
You've already told me that.

57
00:03:08,124 --> 00:03:10,466
You're going to have a tough time not doing home movies.

58
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:11,534
Movies, impressions.

59
00:03:11,582 --> 00:03:13,622
I'm even going to go into Lucy, daughter of the devil.

60
00:03:13,646 --> 00:03:14,558
I'm going to be like, holy shit.

61
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:19,286
Do you remember when you played the vampire guy and you were like, I forget everything you know about vampire.

62
00:03:19,358 --> 00:03:20,470
You remember that? Yeah.

63
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,226
It's going to be great.

64
00:03:21,288 --> 00:03:23,100
So he's going to like me.

65
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,462
I have thoughts about various interviews.

66
00:03:26,486 --> 00:03:30,578
He's done with academics, authors, debates.

67
00:03:30,614 --> 00:03:31,886
He's done with libertarian.

68
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:32,580
Right.

69
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,590
He's fucked with Stephen crowder.

70
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:36,262
Right.

71
00:03:36,276 --> 00:03:37,430
You just have voice acting.

72
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,774
I have Brendan Small, and that's it.

73
00:03:40,812 --> 00:03:40,978
Yeah.

74
00:03:41,004 --> 00:03:41,650
There we go.

75
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,718
What's your bright spot? My bright spot is I put it up.

76
00:03:45,744 --> 00:03:46,414
I finished it.

77
00:03:46,452 --> 00:04:01,834
I compiled all of the annoying tweets that I made and I got rid of all the insults and all of the personal tax and all of the anything that isn't at the trial because I wanted to share a disorienting experience with people.

78
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:13,934
There's going to be way better books written about it that make more sense and that will be enjoyable to read, but you won't get the real experience of being there, which was disorienting and unenjoyable.

79
00:04:13,982 --> 00:04:17,830
I think a lot of people are going to resent the lack of insult.

80
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,834
I think people are going to want those insults.

81
00:04:20,882 --> 00:04:21,130
Yeah.

82
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:27,778
Well, that's the problem you've cultivated through the live tweeting, where people are like, I know I don't like it.

83
00:04:27,804 --> 00:04:28,786
Here's the problem.

84
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:31,846
The final draft, 50,000 words.

85
00:04:31,908 --> 00:04:34,354
Dan, I don't know if you recall what I said.

86
00:04:34,392 --> 00:04:38,170
The initial amount of total words I'd written over this time period.

87
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:39,610
No.

88
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,558
70,000.

89
00:04:40,644 --> 00:04:41,280
Yeah.

90
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:43,486
20,000.

91
00:04:43,548 --> 00:04:43,870
Cut out.

92
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,130
I know how to take care of things.

93
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,620
$20,000.

94
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,174
Quite a ratio.

95
00:04:50,342 --> 00:04:51,814
Yeah, but it's done.

96
00:04:51,852 --> 00:04:53,086
You can go to my website.

97
00:04:53,148 --> 00:04:53,942
The quiet part loud.

98
00:04:53,966 --> 00:04:54,430
It's the front.

99
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,090
Did you include that whole thing where everyone was saying grapejob to Barn? No, I did not.

100
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,758
Again, no personal tax.

101
00:04:59,844 --> 00:05:03,190
I didn't even mention that grape job barns existed.

102
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:08,498
All it is, you can go to my website and you can download it as PDF.

103
00:05:08,654 --> 00:05:10,618
Don't pay anything for it.

104
00:05:10,764 --> 00:05:12,598
Don't give anybody anything for it.

105
00:05:12,624 --> 00:05:13,754
Donate, buddy.

106
00:05:13,802 --> 00:05:15,154
Or just read it.

107
00:05:15,312 --> 00:05:17,026
Well, what fun.

108
00:05:17,088 --> 00:05:17,638
Yeah.

109
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:25,210
For everyone who is wondering, where are those where are those tweets? I'm so sensitive.

110
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:33,960
Well, in front of me for writing good Twitter, but you had a good tenure at your new job, as you refer to it.

111
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:39,480
I say I got a gig one time and it is death for me.

112
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,150
It's a funny way to describe eating.

113
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,086
Yes.

114
00:05:44,148 --> 00:05:45,526
For a short period of time.

115
00:05:45,588 --> 00:05:46,558
Yes, I get it.

116
00:05:46,644 --> 00:05:51,534
Because it's hilarious.

117
00:05:51,582 --> 00:05:52,010
It does.

118
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,658
And it is.

119
00:05:52,744 --> 00:05:53,502
And it's sad.

120
00:05:53,586 --> 00:06:02,070
So, Jordan, today, like I said, we're starting to part one of the trial coverage and sort of the surrounding aura.

121
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:02,694
Indeed.

122
00:06:02,802 --> 00:06:07,074
In some sense, I think the surrounding stuff will be a little bit more in the next episode.

123
00:06:07,122 --> 00:06:07,454
Got you.

124
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:21,410
But today what we're going to be doing is going over the testimony that Alex gave at the trial, which I didn't expect we were going to cover, because I thought all that stuff was like, you can't make copies of this, but then it's all law and crime.

125
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,606
I guess they just put it out there.

126
00:06:23,728 --> 00:06:24,290
So, yeah.

127
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,214
I mean, it's ours now.

128
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:25,562
Yeah.

129
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:27,386
Nothing you can do about it.

130
00:06:27,568 --> 00:06:31,382
Hundreds of thousands of people are watching those videos, so I'm going to go ahead and take it.

131
00:06:31,396 --> 00:06:31,754
Fair use.

132
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:33,150
Now, that audio.

133
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:40,630
So we're going to cover Alex's direct questioning from Raynal.

134
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:41,022
Sure.

135
00:06:41,096 --> 00:06:51,202
And then the cross examination, and then we're going to get into the aftermath of the compensatory damages.

136
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:51,678
Sure.

137
00:06:51,764 --> 00:06:53,526
And that's where we're going to leave off.

138
00:06:53,588 --> 00:06:53,814
Okay.

139
00:06:53,852 --> 00:07:00,654
Alex's response to the compensatory damages, waiting for the next day when he will end up in the punitive fix.

140
00:07:00,692 --> 00:07:01,086
Got you.

141
00:07:01,148 --> 00:07:06,810
Okay, so that is what part one will cover and then part two will pick up and sprawl from there.

142
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,914
So this one is far from home.

143
00:07:10,952 --> 00:07:12,514
And then the next one is endgame.

144
00:07:12,622 --> 00:07:14,710
I forgot how these movies are titled.

145
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,086
I haven't seen any of them.

146
00:07:16,148 --> 00:07:18,330
Okay, so yes, good call.

147
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,130
100% perfectly accurate.

148
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,618
Marvel metaphor.

149
00:07:22,774 --> 00:07:27,066
So before we do that, though, Jordan, let's get back to something we haven't done in a while.

150
00:07:27,248 --> 00:07:28,506
Say hello to some new walk.

151
00:07:28,568 --> 00:07:29,158
Yay.

152
00:07:29,314 --> 00:07:31,930
So first objection, non responsive.

153
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,502
Thank you so much.

154
00:07:32,516 --> 00:07:33,670
You're now a policy wonk.

155
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:34,702
I'm a policy wonk.

156
00:07:34,726 --> 00:07:35,406
Thank you very much.

157
00:07:35,468 --> 00:07:35,910
Thank you.

158
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,846
Next afternoon podcast.

159
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:41,706
You inspired me to fact check my local Birch right weirdo in podcast form.

160
00:07:41,768 --> 00:07:42,378
Thank you.

161
00:07:42,464 --> 00:07:44,158
You are now a policywalk.

162
00:07:44,254 --> 00:07:45,270
I'm a policy walk.

163
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,302
Thank you very much.

164
00:07:46,436 --> 00:07:46,770
Next.

165
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,594
Hearing the old technocrat drop makes me feel three years younger.

166
00:07:49,642 --> 00:07:50,202
Thank you so much.

167
00:07:50,216 --> 00:07:51,562
You are now policy wonk.

168
00:07:51,646 --> 00:07:52,642
I'm a policy wonk.

169
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:53,370
Thank you very much.

170
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:53,850
Thank you.

171
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,294
Next.

172
00:07:54,392 --> 00:07:55,474
Justin and Tony.

173
00:07:55,582 --> 00:07:56,902
You're going Zimbabwe.

174
00:07:56,986 --> 00:07:57,618
Thank you so much.

175
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:58,854
You're now a policy walk.

176
00:07:58,952 --> 00:08:00,042
I'm apology walk.

177
00:08:00,116 --> 00:08:01,554
I forgot that one.

178
00:08:01,712 --> 00:08:07,062
How much have we forgotten? I thought it was baby, but I still like it.

179
00:08:07,076 --> 00:08:07,698
That was good.

180
00:08:07,784 --> 00:08:08,622
Thank you very much.

181
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:12,130
Next, it may be easier to just say it's pronounced Mikayla.

182
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,858
My mom was a creative speller.

183
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:14,418
Thank you so much.

184
00:08:14,444 --> 00:08:15,586
You are now policywalk.

185
00:08:15,658 --> 00:08:16,678
I'm a PolicyWonk.

186
00:08:16,714 --> 00:08:17,370
Thank you very much.

187
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,082
Mikayla.

188
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,590
And angering Alex by being tall at the mall.

189
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:21,198
Thank you so much.

190
00:08:21,224 --> 00:08:22,426
You're now a policy wonk.

191
00:08:22,498 --> 00:08:23,578
I'm a policy wonk.

192
00:08:23,614 --> 00:08:24,342
Thank you very much.

193
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,098
Finally, Jordan, we have a technician in the mix.

194
00:08:26,134 --> 00:08:28,294
I have to make that other person feel three years younger.

195
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:29,214
We use the old draw.

196
00:08:29,252 --> 00:08:29,706
Alright.

197
00:08:29,828 --> 00:08:34,138
But my husband knows the term is policy wonk but still calls it poly wonk.

198
00:08:34,234 --> 00:08:35,430
He's going to be so happy.

199
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,538
He's now a technocrat.

200
00:08:36,574 --> 00:08:37,674
Thank you so much.

201
00:08:37,832 --> 00:08:39,682
You are now a technocrat.

202
00:08:39,766 --> 00:08:41,720
I'm a policy wonk four star.

203
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,334
Someone sodomite sent me a bucket of poop.

204
00:08:46,382 --> 00:08:48,650
Daddy sharp bomb.

205
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:52,886
Jar Jar Binks has a Caribbean black accent.

206
00:08:53,018 --> 00:08:56,078
He's a loser little kiddy baby.

207
00:08:56,174 --> 00:08:57,718
I don't want to hate black people.

208
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:58,454
I renounce.

209
00:08:58,502 --> 00:08:59,386
Jesus Christ.

210
00:08:59,508 --> 00:09:00,430
Thank you so much.

211
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,870
Yes, thank you very much.

212
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,842
So now, Jordan, we begin with Alex being sworn in.

213
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:12,574
And I do think that this isn't going to be a complete play by play of everything that happened.

214
00:09:12,732 --> 00:09:28,810
There's a lot of stuff that I think, honestly, anyone who listens to our show would be like, this is boring, this is that was a lot of the experience of us being in the room for especially his first day of just being like, are you doing an ad read right now? Well, we might include that.

215
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:38,482
Well, maybe, but Alex is sworn in and he tries to take a piece of paper up to the stand with him, which causes a little problem.

216
00:09:38,676 --> 00:09:39,070
Mr.

217
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,830
Reynolds.

218
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,758
The defense would call Alex E.

219
00:09:45,784 --> 00:09:46,266
Jones.

220
00:09:46,338 --> 00:09:46,910
All right, Mr.

221
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,940
Jones, come stand in front of me, please.

222
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,386
Raise your right hand.

223
00:09:51,568 --> 00:10:00,542
Do you solemnly square or affirm under penalty of perjury, that the testimony you are about to give shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? I do.

224
00:10:00,616 --> 00:10:01,094
Thank you.

225
00:10:01,132 --> 00:10:04,110
Come have a seat in the witness chair.

226
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,306
There is water and glasses.

227
00:10:06,498 --> 00:10:08,046
You have pretty good volume.

228
00:10:08,118 --> 00:10:10,770
I don't think you'll need to lean into the microphone.

229
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,878
I see that you have a document with you.

230
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:25,730
I don't know if you were here when I explained to a prior witness who brought documents with them that you can't look at any document for any reason while you're testifying and go on unless one of the lawyers or myself instructs you to do so.

231
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,430
So I'm going to ask you to actually just give it back to Mr.

232
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,514
Reynald until he may think you need it.

233
00:10:31,552 --> 00:10:32,006
Okay.

234
00:10:32,128 --> 00:10:32,800
Okay.

235
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,318
Did you understand all that? I did, yes.

236
00:10:35,404 --> 00:10:35,906
Okay.

237
00:10:36,028 --> 00:10:40,838
One of the things that's fun about that is that Alex is so invested in this.

238
00:10:40,864 --> 00:10:46,310
Like, we're teleprompter free, and then he's trying to bring handwritten notes to the stand.

239
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,038
So he remembers his talking points.

240
00:10:48,124 --> 00:10:51,086
I mean, it's the fact that they were handwritten, too.

241
00:10:51,268 --> 00:10:52,250
Come on.

242
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,860
Really? Yeah.

243
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,110
On some level, I get it.

244
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,206
I get the impulse.

245
00:10:58,278 --> 00:10:58,658
Yeah.

246
00:10:58,744 --> 00:11:00,602
I would rather have talking points.

247
00:11:00,676 --> 00:11:01,300
Sure.

248
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,558
No, that's fair.

249
00:11:02,584 --> 00:11:07,010
Instead of just being adrift at sea and having to answer whatever question is asked of me.

250
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:07,660
Fair.

251
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:10,550
But yeah, you don't get to do that.

252
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,114
Yeah.

253
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,478
I mean, this wasn't day one of the trials.

254
00:11:14,514 --> 00:11:15,100
No.

255
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,342
Day five.

256
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:18,160
Yeah.

257
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,006
We've already experienced this Tuesday.

258
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,174
No, this would have been day seven.

259
00:11:23,272 --> 00:11:24,170
Day six.

260
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:24,674
Yes.

261
00:11:24,712 --> 00:11:26,162
Day six of the trial proper.

262
00:11:26,236 --> 00:11:26,870
Yeah.

263
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:39,370
Because if you don't count but we had seen for a week everyone come unprepared and then they had a weekend.

264
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:39,846
Yeah.

265
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:49,990
Because what we have not discussed is up until this point, you already had Owen Troyer, you already had you already had Becca, you already had Wills zip.

266
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:50,634
Yeah.

267
00:11:50,792 --> 00:11:51,150
Mr.

268
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,910
Crouch.

269
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:52,758
Yeah.

270
00:11:52,904 --> 00:12:04,662
And so you'd already had a real contrast in the infowars people and the witnesses that were being called by the plaintiffs in terms of their ability to answer basic questions.

271
00:12:04,736 --> 00:12:05,010
Sure.

272
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,418
Yeah.

273
00:12:05,504 --> 00:12:06,906
And so Alex comes up.

274
00:12:06,968 --> 00:12:13,662
I also didn't include the part where he was scolded for chewing gum and then tried oh, my God.

275
00:12:13,736 --> 00:12:17,634
There were some things that were just kind of like, what do we do? We have some things to talk about.

276
00:12:17,672 --> 00:12:18,738
Let's not get bogged down.

277
00:12:18,764 --> 00:12:19,350
Yes.

278
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,670
We're going to be here a while.

279
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:33,166
So Reynold comes in with his first question, and one of the things that I think becomes abundantly clear really fast is that Alex does not appreciate the notion of not just being able to ramble.

280
00:12:33,298 --> 00:12:33,846
Right.

281
00:12:33,968 --> 00:12:34,254
Yes.

282
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:34,954
He was not a fan.

283
00:12:35,002 --> 00:12:37,266
It's one of the things that he has.

284
00:12:37,328 --> 00:12:42,740
It's the most sacred to him and he does not respond well to being told you have to answer questions.

285
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:48,390
Alex, would you please introduce yourself to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury? I'm Alex Jones.

286
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:57,678
How are you feeling today, Alex? I actually feel good because I got a chance to, for the first time, say what's really going on.

287
00:12:57,704 --> 00:13:02,180
Instead of the corporate media and high powered law firms manipulating what I actually did.

288
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:12,738
I want to start by kind of letting the jury know a little bit about your use and where you grew up so they can get to know you better.

289
00:13:12,764 --> 00:13:14,060
Is that okay? Okay.

290
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,082
Before we do that, I just do want to say this on my head.

291
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:20,994
As I said it many times, I apologize to both the same.

292
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:21,534
So, Mr.

293
00:13:21,572 --> 00:13:26,454
Jones, one of the instructions I just gave you is that this is not a conversation question.

294
00:13:26,612 --> 00:13:29,034
And the answer so she got the monologue, but not me.

295
00:13:29,072 --> 00:13:29,610
I got it.

296
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,062
And so you have to only answer questions that are asked to you.

297
00:13:34,196 --> 00:13:38,766
So you can see here that in the first question Alex has asked, he's already off track.

298
00:13:38,888 --> 00:13:51,978
He's trying to monologue and control the entirety of the conversation because why wouldn't he think he should be able to? I find it hard to imagine that Renault has had any success ever trying to keep Alex on point, like off the stand.

299
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:58,894
So why should this be any different? Right at the end, Alex says that it's not fair that he doesn't get to talk, but she got to monologue.

300
00:13:59,002 --> 00:14:03,102
This is in reference to Scarlett Lewis's testimony from just prior to him taking the stand.

301
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,122
And there's a reason why she got to monologue.

302
00:14:05,146 --> 00:14:12,774
As Alex put it, it's because Reynald knew damn well that he wasn't going to object and interrupt her for as much of a shithead as he seems to be.

303
00:14:12,812 --> 00:14:16,582
I don't think Raynall is so detached from his humanity as to deprive Ms.

304
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:24,390
Lewis of her chance to speak her piece to Alex after all this time and him dodging the moment of having to look her in the face and hear her words.

305
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,794
Truth be told, Lewis probably was a bit off subject at a few points in her testimony.

306
00:14:29,842 --> 00:14:36,246
And if Reynold had objected, there's a really good chance that the judge would have no choice but to refocus the question asked.

307
00:14:36,368 --> 00:14:37,794
But he didn't do that.

308
00:14:37,892 --> 00:14:39,678
And that's what Alex is mad about.

309
00:14:39,764 --> 00:14:47,466
You're not mad that she got to monologue and you don't that your lawyer didn't stop it, right? Yeah.

310
00:14:47,528 --> 00:15:12,598
I mean, it does seem like what is really causing Alex ire is that his lawyer did not badger Scarlett Lewis with questions or interrupt her answers of questions that the plaintiff's attorneys you understand why we're here? Yeah, I think that it would have taken a really cold, cold lawyer objection.

311
00:15:12,634 --> 00:15:16,258
Not responsive to her talking about her son died.

312
00:15:16,294 --> 00:15:16,710
Yes.

313
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,282
That would have been a dark day.

314
00:15:18,356 --> 00:15:18,882
Yeah.

315
00:15:19,016 --> 00:15:30,126
So Alex does want to stress, as he was trying to this sidebar that he was going down, that he apologized and he's sorry and all this, so he attempts an apology here.

316
00:15:30,308 --> 00:15:30,690
Mr.

317
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:38,982
Jones, have you been wanting to apologize to the plaintiffs in this case for a long time? Yes.

318
00:15:39,116 --> 00:15:44,970
And what would you like to say to them? That I never intentionally tried to hurt you.

319
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:49,450
I never even said your name until this case came to court.

320
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,290
I didn't even really know you were until a couple of years ago.

321
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:55,878
When all this started up, the Internet had a lot of questions.

322
00:15:55,964 --> 00:15:57,020
I had questions.

323
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:08,274
And over that six, seven year period before I got sued or six year period, it's clear you can see the whole progression of us, the few times we covered it, trying to actually find out what happened.

324
00:16:08,432 --> 00:16:19,326
And that's really been my big frustration, is that people have said that I'm personally trying to hurt them, are coming after them when I question every big event.

325
00:16:19,388 --> 00:16:22,942
And a lot of times it turns out that we've not been told the truth.

326
00:16:23,086 --> 00:16:29,206
And a perfect example is today, where they play a 30 or a 1 minute clip.

327
00:16:29,338 --> 00:16:33,282
And I had just done that this morning, and I knew that.

328
00:16:33,296 --> 00:16:41,430
I said, I believe that Scarlett Lewis is real, and she's a really nice person, and she's really a sweet person.

329
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:47,550
And then I went through and talked about her ex husband, too, and then I said, I believe they're being fed and manipulated.

330
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:53,674
Okay.

331
00:16:53,832 --> 00:16:54,622
Oh, my God.

332
00:16:54,696 --> 00:16:56,194
I always just wants to power through.

333
00:16:56,292 --> 00:16:57,094
Oh, my God.

334
00:16:57,192 --> 00:17:02,486
So the clip he's talking about is something we went over on our 711 episode.

335
00:17:02,558 --> 00:17:03,518
Episode 711.

336
00:17:03,554 --> 00:17:04,426
It wasn't an episode about it.

337
00:17:04,428 --> 00:17:06,070
It wasn't in 711 either.

338
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:13,042
That was the clip of Alex talking about how hesleyn appeared slow and all this.

339
00:17:13,176 --> 00:17:17,686
He's trying to argue that they selectively edited everything.

340
00:17:17,868 --> 00:17:18,778
Right, whatever.

341
00:17:18,864 --> 00:17:19,114
Yeah.

342
00:17:19,152 --> 00:17:22,778
His argument was essentially you didn't play the whole clip.

343
00:17:22,814 --> 00:17:31,934
See, what happened is the first thing I said was, I'm sorry, and then I said that he was slow and that I think he's on the spectrum.

344
00:17:31,982 --> 00:17:33,730
So this is not an apology.

345
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:45,322
Alex attempting to defend himself by saying that he didn't mean to hurt anyone and he didn't actually even say things that would hurt them to begin with, because people just take things he says out of context and attack him.

346
00:17:45,456 --> 00:17:48,722
This is pathetic, but this is Alex's understanding of an apology.

347
00:17:48,866 --> 00:17:54,290
It's not about recognizing and respecting the pain that other people experience due to your actions.

348
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:59,294
It's about pretending that you care they were hurt and that it was someone else's fault.

349
00:17:59,402 --> 00:18:01,706
It's cowardly, but it's to be expected.

350
00:18:01,778 --> 00:18:02,014
Yeah.

351
00:18:02,052 --> 00:18:14,410
I mean, if you follow his words, he's essentially saying, basically, you're not smart enough to understand why what I did was actually okay, here are my excuses that you just don't understand.

352
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:19,222
Like, you're mad at me, but really it's your fault, right? I didn't hurt you.

353
00:18:19,296 --> 00:18:21,730
It's the media lying about the things that I said.

354
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,650
I don't even know who you are.

355
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,380
I never said your name.

356
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:26,494
Yeah.

357
00:18:26,532 --> 00:18:32,134
A very respectful thing to say in your defamation trial is honestly, I didn't even know who you were.

358
00:18:32,232 --> 00:18:34,670
It doesn't matter to me who might hurt.

359
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:34,918
Right.

360
00:18:34,944 --> 00:18:41,290
It's almost like he's embassy in the Street Fighter movie a little bit like, wow, you are a real villain here.

361
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,542
The day that I came to your village is the most important day of your life.

362
00:18:44,616 --> 00:18:44,938
For me.

363
00:18:44,964 --> 00:18:45,782
It was Tuesday.

364
00:18:45,866 --> 00:18:46,500
Nothing.

365
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,694
Jesus, man.

366
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:50,506
That's how you're going to go? Good.

367
00:18:50,568 --> 00:18:51,214
Not great.

368
00:18:51,312 --> 00:18:58,258
So Renault wants to humanize Alex, obviously, and so a part of this is walking through some of his earlier life.

369
00:18:58,344 --> 00:19:04,798
And I didn't cut clips from all of it, but there's some stuff that just seemed like, wow, this doesn't match up at all, right.

370
00:19:04,824 --> 00:19:06,310
The way you guys usually talk.

371
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,450
Yeah, we were in there.

372
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,526
So here's the first of that.

373
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:18,770
Can you let us know where are you from in Texas originally? First was born in Dallas, then I grew up in a suburb of Dallas called Rockwall.

374
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:22,690
And how old were you when you moved to Austin? 16.

375
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:31,658
And can you tell the members of the jury why your family relocated Dallas? My dad sold his general practice and there was too much crime in Dallas.

376
00:19:31,694 --> 00:19:33,490
In Austin safer city.

377
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,222
There's too much crime in Dallas.

378
00:19:35,306 --> 00:19:36,240
Oh, boy.

379
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,186
You lived in Rockwall.

380
00:19:38,258 --> 00:19:39,590
Too much crime in Dallas.

381
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,042
Wealthy suburb.

382
00:19:41,186 --> 00:19:56,460
Apparently, if you watch Alex documentary, it's one of the richest suburbs in the country and everybody's rolling around in Rolls Royces and doing his problem is there is too much wage theft going on.

383
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:59,822
There was a lot of crime going on in that neighborhood.

384
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:02,170
Service employees were paid too little.

385
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:08,602
That's what his main issue was, is that the people he was around were not paying their employees well.

386
00:20:08,796 --> 00:20:10,030
You know what? I respect that.

387
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,218
I wish it was.

388
00:20:11,364 --> 00:20:11,746
Yeah.

389
00:20:11,808 --> 00:20:24,730
I think that he knew better than to do the I grew up in a town where Satanists were trying to recruit me to worshiping the devil because they knew that through psychic powers the devil gave them, I would be important to God's mission in the future.

390
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:30,638
And I uncovered a drug ring within the Rock Wall police department and they threatened to murder me if I didn't leave town.

391
00:20:30,734 --> 00:20:34,246
I think that maybe he knew that the jury wouldn't take kindly to that.

392
00:20:34,308 --> 00:20:38,390
Or maybe it would paint him in a bad light because it's clearly ridiculous.

393
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:46,510
Yeah, it would be a little bit like the jury's punitive damages at that point would have to come back with like and he has to wear a straight jacket forever.

394
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:50,290
If you say that on the stand, punitive damages stop being money.

395
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:56,342
I think Alex is pretty lucky that this is not one of those performative, judge exactly situations.

396
00:20:56,426 --> 00:20:57,418
Section eight.

397
00:20:57,564 --> 00:20:58,162
Yeah.

398
00:20:58,296 --> 00:21:05,390
So Alex talks about some of his early influences, and this was one of the points where I almost had to leave the courtroom.

399
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:19,210
How old were you when you first felt that you wanted to be on the air, that you wanted to work in media? When I was about 17, I really liked listening to talk radio.

400
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:24,230
And I'd grown up with my dad on road trips listening to, like, Larry King when he was still on radio.

401
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:29,078
And I really liked Larry King on radio and then also on CNN.

402
00:21:29,234 --> 00:21:31,790
And I also liked Howard Stearn.

403
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,086
Thought he was funny.

404
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:38,786
And I really wanted to be a talk show of you, like CNN, you liked the Clinton News Network.

405
00:21:38,918 --> 00:21:39,646
Please.

406
00:21:39,828 --> 00:21:50,630
This is a strategic answer on Alex's part because he doesn't want to say to the jury that he was brought up listening to and admiring extreme far right demagogues and Christian Identity radio preachers.

407
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:55,714
He doesn't want to say to the jury that he was a devoted fan of the British Israelite preacher David J.

408
00:21:55,752 --> 00:22:03,410
Smith or how he was a regular listener to the Holocaust denying preacher Tex Mars, whose church Alex has said repeatedly that he attends.

409
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:11,930
Yeah, he doesn't want to even tell the version of the story that he relayed in his documentary Alex's War, because even that would sound bad to a jury.

410
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:19,618
Larry King and Howard Stern are largely mainstream touchstones, and they do the sort of shows that Alex wants the jury to think he does.

411
00:22:19,764 --> 00:22:20,858
It's total bullshit.

412
00:22:20,894 --> 00:22:29,422
But it's also very clear why he's presenting his inspiration to get into media this way so the jury doesn't get an accurate sense of what his career has actually been about.

413
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:33,986
Also kind of makes Alex Lee Moyer's editing choices look even more embarrassing.

414
00:22:34,118 --> 00:22:46,222
The use of swelling music over Alex, telling the tale of how he discovered people bringing the fight to the New World Order on public access and how that was the moment he realized he wanted to get into this field seems particularly dumb now.

415
00:22:46,356 --> 00:22:51,982
Just imagine the same music that she played over Alex saying, I really like Larry King's radio show.

416
00:22:52,056 --> 00:22:57,850
They wanted to host a chat program like his doesn't have the same flair.

417
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,818
Maybe you got played or maybe you wanted to be played.

418
00:23:00,854 --> 00:23:15,790
It is so very funny to me, the idea of having made a documentary and then only days later, here your subject almost completely disavow every single thing in that documentary under oath.

419
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:18,514
I don't know.

420
00:23:18,672 --> 00:23:28,166
I'm getting Reset Wars vibes in terms of, like I think there was a lot of ramping up to it, and it seems like no one cared.

421
00:23:28,298 --> 00:23:32,650
No one cares at all about that fucking documentary.

422
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:33,730
I don't know.

423
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:49,750
I mean, I feel almost like I'm dumb for doing as much work in advance because I kind of thought it would be a little bit more widely discussed and maybe viewed than it was preemptive.

424
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,318
They had some big names pre marketing.

425
00:23:53,354 --> 00:23:55,298
It like the interview with Greenwald.

426
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:58,502
It feels like that should move the needle somewhat.

427
00:23:58,586 --> 00:24:01,214
Right? And there were ostensibly 2 million followers.

428
00:24:01,262 --> 00:24:05,830
There were a lot of pre orders online which take however you want, I guess.

429
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,900
I don't know.

430
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:13,882
Anyway, Alex's early show that he did at the beginning of his career, apparently quite different than the current one.

431
00:24:13,896 --> 00:24:14,638
Way different.

432
00:24:14,784 --> 00:24:22,562
And what was the format of your early shows on Austin Public Access TV? It wasn't as conspiratorial or political.

433
00:24:22,646 --> 00:24:29,618
There was some of that because there was some people doing those shows, and I already knew about that information, but it was just all over the map.

434
00:24:29,654 --> 00:24:39,754
It was just really calling shows different topics, different variety shows like card pumpkins on TV on Halloween and have a guy come in with his pet monkey and dances around.

435
00:24:39,852 --> 00:24:44,026
Just fun stuff because I also like Johnny Carson growing up.

436
00:24:44,148 --> 00:24:46,130
Okay, that's complete bullshit.

437
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:52,150
Maybe Alex did do a bit of goofing off on his show, but it was also straight up conspiracy content.

438
00:24:52,320 --> 00:25:03,094
He and his early public access co host, Jeff Davis, made a documentary together titled Are You Practicing Communism? If that gives you some sense of the vibe he was working with back then.

439
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:15,574
It's really hard to get your hands on the shows from back then, but the ones I've seen are complete bullshit and conspiracy laden nonsense, and it's super easy to find accounts from people who worked at the station with him back then.

440
00:25:15,732 --> 00:25:17,690
He was a raven conspiracy lunatic.

441
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:21,420
Even back then, he was an asshole, and no one liked working with him.

442
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:25,222
That's a big part of why his career took the trajectory he did.

443
00:25:25,296 --> 00:25:25,920
Right.

444
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:37,570
It would have been more fun if that was like a PSA where it's like, are you practicing your piano lessons? Like, are you practicing your communism? Are you working on your absolutely, yeah.

445
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,650
Practice makes perfect.

446
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:43,270
Are you going to Communist in Carnegie Hall? Is the question that you should be asking yourself.

447
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,778
Yeah, I tried to watch that documentary.

448
00:25:46,814 --> 00:25:48,710
And how did it go? Well, it's not a documentary.

449
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:51,914
It's like them sitting at a table complaining about communism.

450
00:25:51,962 --> 00:25:55,150
It's between Two Ferns, sort of, but there's a table.

451
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,122
Sure.

452
00:25:56,256 --> 00:25:58,390
No ferns, right? Yeah.

453
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,882
It just was like, I'm not going to do this.

454
00:26:02,076 --> 00:26:04,080
There was no flair, nothing.

455
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,690
Anti communism is terrible.

456
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:11,498
But look, man, Alex loved Larry King.

457
00:26:11,534 --> 00:26:11,926
Of course.

458
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:16,010
Tell us you've told us already about Larry King and about Howard Stern.

459
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:33,754
Who would you say influenced you artistically in the format and how you did your show then and became the man you are today? I mean, really? I listened to Larry King a lot because my dad listened to him on the radio a lot when I was, like, six, seven.

460
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:34,258
I'm really sorry.

461
00:26:34,284 --> 00:26:34,898
Larry King.

462
00:26:34,994 --> 00:26:38,854
And then I watch him a lot of nights at home in junior high school.

463
00:26:38,892 --> 00:26:40,814
So I would say more than anybody, larry King.

464
00:26:40,922 --> 00:26:44,710
If Alex's dad listened to Larry King, he was yelling at him.

465
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:49,646
It was like listening to Larry King and being this fucking communist.

466
00:26:49,718 --> 00:26:52,762
You know what? Honestly, I would almost believe that.

467
00:26:52,896 --> 00:27:00,374
And here's why the Alex's need to interrupt over the TV had to have come from somewhere.

468
00:27:00,422 --> 00:27:04,454
I think it's entirely possible that he did watch his dad just interrupt.

469
00:27:04,502 --> 00:27:07,380
Larry King screaming at the TV all the time.

470
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,290
It's an interesting theory.

471
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:12,434
I think that could just be a style he developed.

472
00:27:12,482 --> 00:27:13,270
Totally.

473
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,146
I understand.

474
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:21,060
Low attention span, highly knee jerk reactive, but yeah, you do what you see.

475
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:29,098
I'm just saying that I'm aging and now I'm recognizing my father's actions in my own and this is entirely about me.

476
00:27:29,124 --> 00:27:30,550
I have no idea what we're talking about.

477
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,906
I can't relate to that at all.

478
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:45,130
alex touches on his first documentary, and this is a real fun claim.

479
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:56,794
Did you also start making in order to support Infowars, did you also start making documentaries? I did start making documentaries in 1997.

480
00:27:56,832 --> 00:28:01,874
I made my first documentary, american Destroyed by Design, about the great reset.

481
00:28:02,042 --> 00:28:03,358
Oh, yeah, that's right.

482
00:28:03,504 --> 00:28:06,094
And the different UN documents that were in it.

483
00:28:06,252 --> 00:28:09,742
And I made more than 25 more films after that.

484
00:28:09,876 --> 00:28:19,490
See, this is, like, so indicative of Alex's shit pretending that his first documentary was about the great reset.

485
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:25,800
Something that didn't become a hot topic in conspiracy circles until 2021, basically.

486
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:29,666
So this is what he's about.

487
00:28:29,728 --> 00:28:31,002
He's about RET conning.

488
00:28:31,086 --> 00:28:40,994
He takes these things that he yelled about in the past and then applies modern labels and contexts to them in order to make it look like hashtag alex Jones was always right.

489
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:43,230
Yeah, it's just such bullshit.

490
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:45,138
You weren't yelling about the great reset.

491
00:28:45,174 --> 00:28:50,070
You were yelling about, like, Agenda 21 and the road in Texas.

492
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:54,678
The road through what was it? Highway.

493
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:58,434
Yeah, the north transatlantic North American highway corridor.

494
00:28:58,482 --> 00:28:59,690
Yeah, something like that.

495
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:03,700
You're yelling about national parks having a sign up in them.

496
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:05,510
Get off.

497
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,494
It is like, we talked about it with Market Bill just a little bit.

498
00:29:09,532 --> 00:29:28,730
But it is like, you can't really have a jury of Alex's peers out of anybody that doesn't like, how can you say, oh, you can't lie under oath to that? Like, you and I both know that that's a complete lie, but who's going to say it? I don't know if that's a substantive lie to the case.

499
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,406
Totally.

500
00:29:29,538 --> 00:29:33,146
So maybe it's kind of fine for the proceedings of this.

501
00:29:33,268 --> 00:29:34,938
Right, but you're under oath.

502
00:29:35,094 --> 00:29:36,542
I know all that stuff.

503
00:29:36,676 --> 00:29:38,618
I know it's legally all that it is.

504
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:45,520
But there is a certain part of me that's, like, you have to be able to know that Alex is lying even about that.

505
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,162
Sure.

506
00:29:47,356 --> 00:29:47,642
Yeah.

507
00:29:47,656 --> 00:29:48,890
I agree with that.

508
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:55,238
I think that this runs into the issue of the separate realities because there's a part.

509
00:29:55,264 --> 00:30:01,002
Of Alex that probably believes absolutely that I was talking about the great reset.

510
00:30:01,146 --> 00:30:03,894
When I was three years old, I had a dream about the great reset.

511
00:30:03,942 --> 00:30:05,606
The Lord spoke it to me.

512
00:30:05,788 --> 00:30:13,758
How does Narcissism work and its effects on whether or not you think you're being truthful? And that's something that would be difficult to unpack.

513
00:30:13,794 --> 00:30:22,914
But I would say that, oath or no oath, you're a fool if you think Alex is ever going to actually give you truthful answers, tricks and direct answers.

514
00:30:22,962 --> 00:30:23,606
Yes.

515
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:36,890
So we get back to talking about the time of Sandy Hook on Alex's show, right? And what was his show like? What was the environment at Infowars? I believe I recall.

516
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:59,000
Can you tell us what the sort of different segments are that would appear on a given day at Infowars circuit 2012? There was my four hour radio show that in 2012 was just a webcam on me for people that wanted to watch it online.

517
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:02,850
And then it was just me on a desk or camera.

518
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:09,694
That was it.

519
00:31:09,732 --> 00:31:16,858
Basically, the primary goal of Alex's answer here is to downplay his own relevance and the size of his operation in 2012.

520
00:31:17,004 --> 00:31:23,938
He wants the jury to think that though he's a big famous boy now, back then he was really just mom and pop talk show.

521
00:31:24,084 --> 00:31:25,766
Unfortunately, he's lying.

522
00:31:25,898 --> 00:31:28,486
He didn't just have a webcam on a desk at that point.

523
00:31:28,548 --> 00:31:33,466
He had two studios, each with multiple camera angles available at any point.

524
00:31:33,588 --> 00:31:40,006
He also had more than just his show being broadcast daily, since the Infowars Nightly News was in existence at that point.

525
00:31:40,128 --> 00:31:49,262
The Nightly News started in 2011, and it contained a bunch of content that's relevant to this very lawsuit, like instances of Rob Do covering Sandy Hook.

526
00:31:49,406 --> 00:31:54,418
Alex knows all this, but the goal is to create the perception that he really wasn't that big back then.

527
00:31:54,444 --> 00:32:02,222
So it couldn't have been him that was so influential in getting the Sandy Hook conspiracies rolling and causing the harm that was done to Neal and Scarlett.

528
00:32:02,306 --> 00:32:03,110
It's a fraud.

529
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:09,326
And one of the telltale signs is that pretending a show he produced all the way to 2017 doesn't exist.

530
00:32:09,518 --> 00:32:10,754
It's nonsense.

531
00:32:10,922 --> 00:32:11,926
Never heard of it before.

532
00:32:11,988 --> 00:32:14,242
What's this? I've never heard of it before.

533
00:32:14,436 --> 00:32:16,140
I was thinking about this.

534
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:26,710
I can't think of any testimony, real or fictional, I have ever seen that may be more chuck filled with absolute non truths.

535
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:35,354
Like, you were saying that's because in this world, I don't think we're ever dealing with a truth or a lie that doesn't exist.

536
00:32:35,402 --> 00:32:38,582
We're dealing with both and neither simultaneously.

537
00:32:38,606 --> 00:32:39,118
Yeah.

538
00:32:39,264 --> 00:32:45,374
What's convenient and useful to me is the truth is the truth, and I believe it under a lie detector.

539
00:32:45,482 --> 00:32:46,006
Yeah.

540
00:32:46,128 --> 00:32:58,042
And I think that it's bizarre because Narcissism for Alex works in this way of, like, all right, when I need to inflate my self.

541
00:32:58,116 --> 00:32:58,390
Right.

542
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,334
In 2012, I had the biggest show in the world.

543
00:33:00,372 --> 00:33:05,530
I had 100 million every world leader on the planet to my show.

544
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,038
Ron Paul loved me, and he was the rightful president.

545
00:33:08,124 --> 00:33:11,170
Oh, something I owned the tea party.

546
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:13,538
He did run the tea party.

547
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,310
He did explicitly say that.

548
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:26,450
And then the narcissism here is that he needs to not be very big because it's important for him to not have the grand title of the thing that is negative.

549
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,058
Right.

550
00:33:27,204 --> 00:33:36,694
What is that hallmark thing of psychopaths? Is that the manipulating based on what people think want to hear in any situation? Is that one of those things like that? Yeah, that sounds right.

551
00:33:36,792 --> 00:33:44,174
So this next clip is where Alex gets to talking about how talk show hosts are judged.

552
00:33:44,282 --> 00:33:49,150
And this is bizarre.

553
00:33:49,650 --> 00:34:07,438
At the time 2012, how did you all source or how did you source the stories that you wanted to cover during that segment of your talk radio? 95% of what we were covering was mainstream news going, look, they're saying this.

554
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:17,254
Do you believe it or what do you make of this? It's that kind of thing is that we would simply do what talk radio does.

555
00:34:17,292 --> 00:34:18,658
That's what talk radio does.

556
00:34:18,804 --> 00:34:25,474
That's what Larry King did, is stack the news articles, talk about what's going on, what people are saying.

557
00:34:25,632 --> 00:34:37,870
Ask callers, what do you think of that? Do you buy that? What do you think is going to happen next? Are there really WMDs in Iraq? Are they lying about it? And then the talk show hosts make their predictions about what they think.

558
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:42,230
And then the talk radio listeners basically keep note and see who's the most accurate.

559
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:48,478
And it becomes a big game to see who has made the best predictions and things like that.

560
00:34:48,504 --> 00:35:01,382
And so that kind of lends itself to the very nature of a soapbox, is people speculating that's the nature of people going to a park and standing up at Speaker's Corner in London for 600 years and giving their opinion.

561
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:03,240
That's what free speech is.

562
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:09,706
Okay, that is one of the most absurd descriptions of, like, five different things I've ever heard.

563
00:35:09,768 --> 00:35:11,534
I mean, it got into, like, town criers.

564
00:35:11,582 --> 00:35:12,118
Exactly.

565
00:35:12,264 --> 00:35:12,960
Yeah.

566
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:17,474
He thinks that his audience is sitting there with a pen and a pad.

567
00:35:17,642 --> 00:35:23,078
His prediction? No, it's like they have baseball scorecards.

568
00:35:23,114 --> 00:35:26,218
They're like, oh, okay, Alex hit a single on this one.

569
00:35:26,304 --> 00:35:27,346
Draw one line.

570
00:35:27,468 --> 00:35:30,890
Holy shit, Rush Limbaugh hits one out of the park.

571
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:42,430
I mean, look, from the time that we've been doing this show and the predictions that we've seen from him, if anyone was doing this and talk show hosts were judged by this, he would be out of business.

572
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,766
He would be an outlier.

573
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:44,460
Yeah.

574
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:48,978
He would be an outlier.

575
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:49,840
That's true.

576
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:53,930
He's fortunate that no one is keeping a pen and paper.

577
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,266
Yeah.

578
00:35:54,328 --> 00:35:57,006
If that is true, god damn.

579
00:35:57,198 --> 00:36:04,886
The world would have to have been destroyed multiple times over by now in order for his predictions to have any decent track record absolutely.

580
00:36:05,008 --> 00:36:07,782
Cities in America would be constantly getting nuked.

581
00:36:07,866 --> 00:36:08,402
Right.

582
00:36:08,536 --> 00:36:11,740
The globalists would be starving everyone.

583
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:16,502
We would all be dead of a plague of locusts years ago.

584
00:36:16,576 --> 00:36:16,850
Right.

585
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:20,150
And this is how Alex always kind of gets into your head.

586
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:30,050
It's like, that is so insane that you almost forget he said that free speech is really just a dude standing on a box in the corner in London screaming for 6 hours.

587
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:34,662
But back then, the town crier that you listen to, you judge by their predictions.

588
00:36:34,746 --> 00:36:35,390
Yes.

589
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,982
But then you judge their predictions by how long they stayed in the stocks.

590
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:42,098
I think that might actually be a better situation for us.

591
00:36:42,184 --> 00:36:45,590
Man, you have enough bad predictions, you go in the stocks for a week.

592
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,134
Yeah, I think that is you're, right.

593
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:50,538
That is one of the tools of Alex's absurdity.

594
00:36:50,634 --> 00:36:51,362
Yeah.

595
00:36:51,556 --> 00:36:52,974
There's constant heightening.

596
00:36:53,022 --> 00:36:54,678
There's so many layers of absurdity.

597
00:36:54,714 --> 00:36:54,950
Yeah.

598
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,986
So you're like, wait, I can't deal with part A.

599
00:36:58,048 --> 00:37:01,182
Part B is part C is hilarious.

600
00:37:01,266 --> 00:37:12,580
Part D what are you talking about? What is happening? So in the conversation about sources, Alex says this now most of the time though, I say, I want this person, I want that person.

601
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:17,718
I'm more in control of the guests that I have.

602
00:37:17,744 --> 00:37:28,466
But in the past, we let more things driven by the Internet and by Fortune and HM.

603
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:31,022
But in every case I've had problems has been a curse.

604
00:37:31,106 --> 00:37:40,726
I'm not thanking everybody that's on there, but I told my producers, do not touch it when it's on there because it's just a death and it causes nothing but problems.

605
00:37:40,848 --> 00:37:46,018
It's bullshit that Alex is saying there's a moratorium on this kind of sourcing, like some things on Fort Chan.

606
00:37:46,164 --> 00:38:04,450
But if you want to take this seriously at all, then what Alex needs to do is take a real hard look in the mirror, take an inventory of the things that he said based on Fortune posts, and retract all of it.

607
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:09,130
He needs to go back and look at the Soros antifa contract.

608
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:28,498
He needs to go back and find all of these things and really wrestle with like, okay, if you now know this to be a completely unreliable source, you need to figure out what parts of your mythology, what parts of your worldview are solely informed by that and work to get those out.

609
00:38:28,644 --> 00:38:33,842
Make sure that people don't still believe them because otherwise you're still using Fortune as a source.

610
00:38:33,866 --> 00:38:40,282
Essentially he doesn't do that because those things that are based on Fortune nonsense are too important to you.

611
00:38:40,296 --> 00:38:41,338
Right? Yeah.

612
00:38:41,364 --> 00:38:41,554
No.

613
00:38:41,592 --> 00:38:50,302
If you find out a single cop used to be a drug dealer for ten years, every single case that that cop worked on needs to be reevaluated and thrown out or whatever.

614
00:38:50,376 --> 00:38:52,066
So it's the same thing.

615
00:38:52,128 --> 00:38:53,594
It's the same fundamental principle.

616
00:38:53,642 --> 00:38:54,142
Yeah.

617
00:38:54,276 --> 00:38:55,414
It's hard work.

618
00:38:55,512 --> 00:38:56,590
It is very hard.

619
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:03,694
The reason Alex isn't going to do it justice is you don't do it you don't like what the result is going to be, it's not going to be good for him.

620
00:39:03,732 --> 00:39:20,294
No, because then you have to find another way to try and prove that Soros has antifa contracts to burn down cities, which is a real big part of your whole bullshit opposition to the Black Lives Matter protest, while you're at least one of the ways that you pretended it wasn't based on any flagrant racism.

621
00:39:20,342 --> 00:39:26,378
Right, but, hey, don't go ahead and do that because it's too complicated.

622
00:39:26,414 --> 00:39:27,406
It would take a while.

623
00:39:27,528 --> 00:39:32,242
Daria didn't even like finding the things that she was asked about for two years.

624
00:39:32,376 --> 00:39:33,710
Well, Wikipedia.

625
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:35,458
Well, she did like finding that.

626
00:39:35,544 --> 00:39:39,170
So Alex doesn't like the news anymore.

627
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,550
It's not surprising.

628
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:46,174
And more and more I don't really follow the news model of covering the news.

629
00:39:46,212 --> 00:39:46,630
In the past.

630
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,122
I did.

631
00:39:47,196 --> 00:39:48,418
We still do it a lot.

632
00:39:48,564 --> 00:40:11,854
But now, I mean, I just talk about philosophy and the big picture and then have some guests on the show has gotten more Christian because I'm a Christian, but as things progress while things happening in the world, I'm moving more towards doing a self help life experience than the political show.

633
00:40:11,952 --> 00:40:26,926
Like, I've been trying to segue out of this just because I think we have to change individuals, kind of like Scarlet was saying earlier, more than we're going to change the world, we can't change ourselves, that we're ever able to change the world.

634
00:40:27,048 --> 00:40:31,414
And I've made a lot of mistakes, and I've learned a lot in that process.

635
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:43,380
And I've also learned how the corporate media is able to completely manipulate a story once you're caught in it and then manipulate other people.

636
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:53,194
And if anything, I want to teach people about how that process works because they say I'm the mastermind to figure it out, manipulate people.

637
00:40:53,232 --> 00:40:55,462
And I didn't have any understanding of it coming.

638
00:40:55,536 --> 00:41:00,466
And then now I've seen it from the inside, the way this stuff goes on.

639
00:41:00,648 --> 00:41:08,782
And again, I think only getting the individual awake and aware and not under his control is the way to beat it.

640
00:41:08,796 --> 00:41:12,442
And you can't just cover a bunch of news and get somebody to understand that.

641
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,702
You can't be told about the matrix.

642
00:41:14,786 --> 00:41:15,994
You got to see it.

643
00:41:16,152 --> 00:41:17,794
He's on the stand.

644
00:41:17,952 --> 00:41:18,742
Yeah.

645
00:41:18,936 --> 00:41:20,470
This is Rambling.

646
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:27,950
Look, on the one hand, I guess he's just saying what you kind of could tell if you watch his show.

647
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,142
Sure.

648
00:41:28,156 --> 00:41:35,190
And that is that he's kind of pivoting into something that is less grounded in reality.

649
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:36,354
Televangeli.

650
00:41:36,522 --> 00:41:39,338
Yeah, stuff like that.

651
00:41:39,364 --> 00:41:44,130
You don't have to pretend you have proof for things.

652
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,826
You can lie about the Bible all day and people really don't care.

653
00:41:47,888 --> 00:41:49,050
Yeah, sure.

654
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:53,794
I think that getting into philosophy in the big picture is a generous way to say yelling about the devil.

655
00:41:53,842 --> 00:41:57,534
There's one way, but yeah, I think this is true.

656
00:41:57,572 --> 00:42:04,410
Alex is giving up the pretense of being about news and documents and all this because it never was real to begin with.

657
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:04,926
Exactly.

658
00:42:05,048 --> 00:42:21,582
I think what's interesting about that is that this is something that I noticed throughout Alex's testimony, is that Alex was clearly the best coached, because I really don't even know if Dario and we're given instructions on what questions Raynall was going to ask me.

659
00:42:21,656 --> 00:42:22,002
Right.

660
00:42:22,076 --> 00:42:30,078
But Reynold was clearly giving Alex prompts for these answers that they had talked about because they don't look as terrible as the real ones do.

661
00:42:30,104 --> 00:42:30,894
Right? Yeah.

662
00:42:30,992 --> 00:42:33,910
And then Alex just can't not be Alex.

663
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:40,374
So he gives his prepared remarks, and then you can see him kind of scramble and then start rambling off and on.

664
00:42:40,412 --> 00:42:45,546
All of a sudden, he's like and so that's why the Democrats are and you're like, no, you are doing so good.

665
00:42:45,728 --> 00:42:47,730
Yes, but that's like, what Alex wants.

666
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,902
It's what he wants to get out on the stand.

667
00:42:49,976 --> 00:42:51,270
He's just got to do it.

668
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,662
He's just got to do it.

669
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,010
He can't stop himself.

670
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:59,310
So part of the reason that he can't stop himself is because he's just over prepared.

671
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:07,170
How many hours a day are you on the air? I'm on the air about 4 hours a day.

672
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:11,598
And since when have you been on the air? About 4 hours a day.

673
00:43:11,744 --> 00:43:14,360
I've been on the air 4 hours a day.

674
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:27,670
And in order to prepare for those 4 hours that you're going to be on the air every day well, let me ask you this.

675
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:32,674
How many days a week? I'm on the air six days a week.

676
00:43:32,832 --> 00:43:48,610
So in order to prepare for 4 hours a day six days a week, how many hours per day do you spend on prep for your show? I spend about 2 hours at night and about 2 hours in the morning, and then I do some research in the afternoon.

677
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:52,718
This is a far cry from the 16 hours a day you're studying.

678
00:43:52,754 --> 00:44:06,650
The Globalist really did seem like he was overplaying his hand, and now it seems like he's downplaying it, huh? Yeah, it seems like on air, I do literally nothing but read Globalist white papers and documents.

679
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:11,090
All of their dirty laundry breathing that are filthy.

680
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:12,806
Filthy dossiers, not even dirty.

681
00:44:12,878 --> 00:44:14,990
I'm dreaming reading these documents.

682
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:15,454
Exactly.

683
00:44:15,552 --> 00:44:15,922
Yeah.

684
00:44:15,996 --> 00:44:18,718
I do about 2 hours of the morning, maybe 2 hours at night.

685
00:44:18,744 --> 00:44:19,630
It's busy.

686
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:22,750
But also, I think that this is a lie.

687
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:31,274
I really don't even know what this is also being used for, because here's why I can explain it.

688
00:44:31,372 --> 00:44:32,714
Well, go for it.

689
00:44:32,812 --> 00:44:35,946
Like, him saying what he says on his show would be laughable.

690
00:44:36,018 --> 00:44:37,754
The jury would never believe that.

691
00:44:37,852 --> 00:44:40,394
It would be something like yeah, right, sure.

692
00:44:40,432 --> 00:44:44,006
What are you doing for 16 hours? Right? You're high.

693
00:44:44,068 --> 00:44:44,642
That's fair.

694
00:44:44,716 --> 00:44:48,270
But the two to 4 hours is believable.

695
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:48,746
Right.

696
00:44:48,808 --> 00:44:51,050
That is a believable amount of work.

697
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,966
You do 4 hours of a show, you do an eight hour work day.

698
00:44:54,028 --> 00:44:54,674
Call it a day.

699
00:44:54,712 --> 00:44:59,078
It's kind of what you would expect for somebody who's doing a job.

700
00:44:59,164 --> 00:44:59,522
Sure.

701
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:00,146
More or less.

702
00:45:00,208 --> 00:45:00,506
Right.

703
00:45:00,568 --> 00:45:06,078
And you don't want him to look like I just shoot from the hip entirely.

704
00:45:06,174 --> 00:45:06,542
Sure.

705
00:45:06,616 --> 00:45:14,618
Because then there's an approach that is structurally irresponsible to what ended up happening.

706
00:45:14,704 --> 00:45:15,278
Right.

707
00:45:15,424 --> 00:45:18,554
But at the same time, you don't want to make it look like he does nothing but do the show.

708
00:45:18,592 --> 00:45:20,046
Because first of all, it's unbelievable.

709
00:45:20,118 --> 00:45:20,390
Right.

710
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,574
Second of all, if so, then you should have vetted Wolfgang Halbeck.

711
00:45:23,622 --> 00:45:27,146
You would think, if you're working hours a day at the time.

712
00:45:27,208 --> 00:45:41,702
Yeah, I mean, I meant more for like the defenses case, because part of what they're arguing is clearly Alex spent so much time on air, what, he spent like five minutes telling these people all of this stuff, that kind of thing.

713
00:45:41,776 --> 00:45:43,562
There's one 10th of 1%.

714
00:45:43,696 --> 00:45:44,380
Right.

715
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:51,114
But it could also be that, look, he works so hard, these things are going to fall through the cracks.

716
00:45:51,162 --> 00:45:56,030
He says, 95% of my time is I'm not doing anything like this, that kind of thing.

717
00:45:56,140 --> 00:46:01,226
But either way, the problem is he's already been found guilty of doing the thing.

718
00:46:01,288 --> 00:46:01,694
Sure.

719
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:07,730
So it can't really reduce the damages, can it? Or is it just like, see, he's a down home country guy.

720
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,182
I think that's a large part of it.

721
00:46:09,196 --> 00:46:11,714
You think that means more like humanizing him? That kind of thing.

722
00:46:11,752 --> 00:46:11,990
Okay.

723
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,994
And the mom and pop aspect of it.

724
00:46:14,032 --> 00:46:14,620
Sure.

725
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:18,410
Because it's just a small propaganda outlet.

726
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:19,634
That's true.

727
00:46:19,672 --> 00:46:22,718
He just puts his payoff no nightly News at this point.

728
00:46:22,804 --> 00:46:33,554
There's a limited amount of employees that he has and the perception is kind of making it more normal as opposed to the absurdity that is.

729
00:46:33,652 --> 00:46:38,526
And that continues even into this next clip, which actually just made me really sad.

730
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:01,426
2015.

731
00:47:01,608 --> 00:47:03,058
I don't have the exact days.

732
00:47:03,204 --> 00:47:10,114
Alex knows damn well that The Nightly News started in 2011, but that would make his operation look much more professional if he were to be aware of that.

733
00:47:10,152 --> 00:47:13,970
So it's pretty important that it started well after the period of Sandy Hook.

734
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:20,858
Even worse is that Alex has completely forgotten about his original companion show, the Infowarrior, featuring Jason Burmese.

735
00:47:21,014 --> 00:47:28,082
That show was on in like 2009 and really, Burmis did so much for Infowars in those early days, in that era.

736
00:47:28,166 --> 00:47:29,498
This omission is insulting.

737
00:47:29,534 --> 00:47:32,738
In fact, in court I poked you and said he forgot about Burma.

738
00:47:32,774 --> 00:47:33,780
You sure did.

739
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:42,674
Again, though, it's definitely not in Alex's best interest to present the image that he was producing other shows on Infowars at this point in his career.

740
00:47:42,782 --> 00:47:45,566
Like I said, this is a mom and pop propaganda outlet.

741
00:47:45,638 --> 00:47:46,054
Absolutely.

742
00:47:46,152 --> 00:47:51,406
And it can't possibly have been the big bogeyman that led to so much pain.

743
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:58,070
No, he wasn't the CEO of maybe what Owen would have to eventually describe as a mainstream media TV studio.

744
00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:01,990
No, I mean, it goes all directions.

745
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:04,174
We're a small thing.

746
00:48:04,272 --> 00:48:05,374
No other shows.

747
00:48:05,532 --> 00:48:08,554
I put in an honest nine to five day at work.

748
00:48:08,592 --> 00:48:13,402
But then, of course, there was actually another question about the working on admin stuff.

749
00:48:13,476 --> 00:48:13,930
Sure.

750
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,486
And he was like, yeah, I do extra hours on that.

751
00:48:16,548 --> 00:48:16,774
Right.

752
00:48:16,812 --> 00:48:18,634
So of course he does extra hours on that.

753
00:48:18,672 --> 00:48:19,930
He does nine to five.

754
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:24,180
But still, folksy, and also the money.

755
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:29,170
Let's talk a little bit about where you get your funding.

756
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:53,690
I had some corporate sponsors when I was against George W.

757
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:54,746
Bush and the war.

758
00:48:54,808 --> 00:48:59,080
Sorry, what? We lost a lot when we ran to war, but we still had some big ones.

759
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:04,214
We had like, car companies, clothing lines, everything.

760
00:49:04,252 --> 00:49:16,540
We were making a lot of money to expand the operation going back to about 2005, up to when Obama got in.

761
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:20,414
And then being anti war was not allowed anymore for whatever reason.

762
00:49:20,452 --> 00:49:21,366
I wasn't anti Obama.

763
00:49:21,378 --> 00:49:22,386
I was antiwar.

764
00:49:22,518 --> 00:49:24,630
So I continue with being antiwar.

765
00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:26,514
We lost all our sponsors.

766
00:49:26,682 --> 00:49:36,654
I guess Alex is just forgetting about his decades long business relationship with Midas Resources and his couple of attempts to branch out into selling his audience to multilevel marketing scams.

767
00:49:36,702 --> 00:49:37,394
That one was fun.

768
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:40,962
How he took a bunch of money from Mike Lindell and my pillow pretty recently.

769
00:49:41,046 --> 00:49:41,330
Sure.

770
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:43,914
And his affiliate links with my Patriot Supply.

771
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:44,474
Wow.

772
00:49:44,572 --> 00:49:53,970
Sure, these aren't respectable sponsors like a car company, but it's pretty important to pretend that Alex had no institutional support around the time of Sandy Hook.

773
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:54,842
There was nothing.

774
00:49:54,916 --> 00:49:56,430
It was just him in the wilderness.

775
00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:57,606
See this? And he's lies.

776
00:49:57,678 --> 00:49:59,870
So much for having his principles.

777
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:03,182
This is why you have to tell people you took one.

778
00:50:03,316 --> 00:50:09,438
And you go with Diamond Gusset and you say, we took one sponsor and they couldn't even get anybody's.

779
00:50:09,474 --> 00:50:09,798
Jeans.

780
00:50:09,834 --> 00:50:10,214
Right.

781
00:50:10,312 --> 00:50:11,382
Diamond Gusset jeans.

782
00:50:11,406 --> 00:50:14,258
And then we were done self funded from there on out.

783
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:22,326
I think it would be really difficult to pretend that Diamond Gusset decided not to sponsor Alex's show because he was against Obama.

784
00:50:22,458 --> 00:50:23,990
Yeah, that one might be tough.

785
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:26,454
Anti NAFTA commercial.

786
00:50:26,622 --> 00:50:28,646
I do like his bullshit on this one.

787
00:50:28,768 --> 00:50:37,850
I was too anti war like a thing that people would believe him saying, where to hide your gun? We don't want to be involved.

788
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:40,574
Sure.

789
00:50:40,732 --> 00:50:47,754
Anyway, Alex decides that maybe a good idea would be to try and red pill the jury.

790
00:50:47,802 --> 00:50:48,998
Yeah, he did do that.

791
00:50:49,144 --> 00:50:50,438
This is one of a couple of them.

792
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:51,400
Here we go.

793
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:53,358
Well, take that clip earlier.

794
00:50:53,394 --> 00:50:54,340
There they are.

795
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:59,306
At the beginning of the clip, I say, I believe Charlotte Lewis is real.

796
00:50:59,368 --> 00:51:00,738
I believe her son died.

797
00:51:00,774 --> 00:51:01,934
I'm very sorry.

798
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:06,230
And they cut that off the front, and then they cut me saying I'm sorry off the end.

799
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:15,230
And they brought a real clip, but it's synthetic to try to see what and I hope you get to see the real clip and then you'll figure out everything else that's been going on.

800
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,280
You'll see all the bullshit, man? Yeah.

801
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:24,854
That was a moment where I was like, holy shit, this can't be allowed to stand.

802
00:51:24,952 --> 00:51:34,362
There were so many times where it was like he was trying to argue that, listen, you and I both know what this is really about to the jury.

803
00:51:34,446 --> 00:51:41,826
Like he's saying to the jury like, hey, listen, I know you know that all this glitz and court is nonsense.

804
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:43,154
Watch the clips in this.

805
00:51:43,192 --> 00:51:43,646
Absolutely.

806
00:51:43,768 --> 00:51:49,014
You'll see that I'm right to convince them, like, listen, you're going to be one of us at the end of this trial.

807
00:51:49,122 --> 00:51:50,426
He believes that? Yeah.

808
00:51:50,488 --> 00:51:50,930
It's crazy.

809
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:53,270
This is a tough way to become an info warrior.

810
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:57,650
Trial by fire in the crucible you have accidentally enlisted.

811
00:51:58,810 --> 00:51:59,462
Oh boy.

812
00:51:59,536 --> 00:51:59,946
Yup.

813
00:52:00,018 --> 00:52:05,440
So another moment that I found particularly distasteful is when he started talking about his products.

814
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:08,582
Do you sell vitamins? Yes.

815
00:52:08,776 --> 00:52:11,874
Are your vitamins? FDA certified.

816
00:52:11,982 --> 00:52:13,000
No, they're not.

817
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:18,930
Why not? The FDA has no trouble working over any nutraceuticals.

818
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:22,902
Not the ones at Whole Foods, not the ones at GMC, and not ours.

819
00:52:22,986 --> 00:52:28,254
And ours are privately labeled top brands that are sold at Whole Foods GNC.

820
00:52:28,362 --> 00:52:33,446
We have a made by the top lab recognized in the United States.

821
00:52:33,568 --> 00:52:37,946
All we use put our label on it so we know it's triple tested the highest quality.

822
00:52:38,068 --> 00:52:42,818
And that's why people love it because it is the best out there.

823
00:52:42,904 --> 00:52:47,042
And I'll give it to Whole Foods and I'll give it to GMC and others.

824
00:52:47,176 --> 00:52:48,414
They got molly pirates.

825
00:52:48,522 --> 00:52:51,254
There's all sorts of crap you can buy at a gas station out there.

826
00:52:51,352 --> 00:52:52,780
That's not what ours is.

827
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:04,222
under oath.

828
00:53:04,246 --> 00:53:07,040
I'd like to tell you that the 4 July special is still going.

829
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:10,770
I am so mad that I wasn't allowed to laugh at the moment.

830
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:14,370
He was like, we buy our PQQ from the Japanese.

831
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:15,382
Holy.

832
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:25,722
Everybody in the courtroom is going to blow what? The Japanese, everyone, everyone knows that the Japanese do not sell their PQQ to just anybody.

833
00:53:25,796 --> 00:53:35,986
What are you talking about? What is happening right now? And the way you said it, the way he delivered it too, like holy shit, I'm going to blow their minds.

834
00:53:36,058 --> 00:53:36,438
Yeah.

835
00:53:36,524 --> 00:53:39,558
God damn, what an insane person.

836
00:53:39,704 --> 00:53:43,750
Yeah, that really threw me for a loop.

837
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:44,590
Wild.

838
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:50,610
And you know that he had to have given Reynald that question to prompt him to sell.

839
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,482
Well, no, I don't think so.

840
00:53:52,616 --> 00:53:53,730
Maybe in Alex's head.

841
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:54,030
Okay.

842
00:53:54,080 --> 00:54:06,154
I would imagine that Raynall believed that the set up of the question was to facilitate exploring Alex's revenue sources in as much as he sells vitamins.

843
00:54:06,202 --> 00:54:09,654
And people look down on him because of it, but they're actually good.

844
00:54:09,812 --> 00:54:14,046
I bet that is the thrust of the question in the attorneys mind.

845
00:54:14,108 --> 00:54:17,398
Right? Not that Alex is going to talk about getting PQQ from Japanese.

846
00:54:17,434 --> 00:54:17,778
Right.

847
00:54:17,864 --> 00:54:29,862
See, this is where I feel like trying to apply the rules of normal logic to what's going on is because it's clear that Raynall thinks something is true and Alex thinks something is true.

848
00:54:29,936 --> 00:54:33,270
And despite the fact that they're supposed to be on the same team, it is not the same thing.

849
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:39,250
I think that's probably a fair assessment, but then again, we're kind of trajection speculation.

850
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:40,098
We're on the outside.

851
00:54:40,184 --> 00:54:40,938
We're on the outside.

852
00:54:41,024 --> 00:54:41,790
I get it.

853
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:42,514
Sustained.

854
00:54:42,562 --> 00:54:42,882
Yeah.

855
00:54:42,956 --> 00:54:45,190
So here Alex Blies.

856
00:54:45,370 --> 00:54:48,042
Let's discuss, for example, email.

857
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:06,218
I know when we look to comply with the discovery, which we comply with, it was over 10 million that they had a search that was still in the inbox unopened.

858
00:55:06,314 --> 00:55:09,302
So it was 10 million unopened and a few hundred thousand opened.

859
00:55:09,386 --> 00:55:13,066
So Alex has said that he complied with discovery, which is going to be a problem later.

860
00:55:13,128 --> 00:55:15,526
Oh, yeah, I'll do it immediately later.

861
00:55:15,588 --> 00:55:17,206
Because he says something else.

862
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:39,520
going back to.

863
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:43,158
I want to ask you a question.

864
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:04,810
that really depends on you, Mr.

865
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:08,400
Vincent, whether you think I need to hear them now or later.

866
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:10,150
I'm worried.

867
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,422
we're going to take a break.

868
00:56:20,616 --> 00:56:26,390
So Mark has stood up and said that we need to make a contemporaneous motion.

869
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:26,782
Yeah.

870
00:56:26,856 --> 00:56:34,034
It's because Alex cannot say that he or his company are bankrupt in this part of the trial that they're in at this stage.

871
00:56:34,202 --> 00:56:40,670
That's a claim that he could make in the portion about net worth, which is separated from the compensatory damages phase of the proceedings.

872
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:44,650
But it would also probably be inappropriate at that point since it's not true.

873
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:47,882
This is why Mark asked to make these motions.

874
00:56:48,026 --> 00:56:55,654
Alex has now said that he's bankrupt and that he complied with discovery in front of the jury, which are both deeply inappropriate things for him to do.

875
00:56:55,692 --> 00:56:56,290
Can't do it.

876
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:58,210
He raises this concern, mark does.

877
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:02,640
And that leads to Judge Gamble dismissing the jury and then saying this.

878
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:11,150
I remember today watching part of Hesley's testimony when I was coming here and him talking about the bankruptcy.

879
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:12,960
So I thought that was totally fine.

880
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:15,790
Mr.

881
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:21,614
Jones, stop making okay, just stop.

882
00:57:21,712 --> 00:57:25,850
Yes, he is confused.

883
00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:28,382
Oh, yeah.

884
00:57:28,456 --> 00:57:30,782
And then this is the last clip from day one.

885
00:57:30,856 --> 00:57:34,910
And I think that this was something that was pretty cathartic for a lot of folks.

886
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:35,906
Mr.

887
00:57:35,968 --> 00:57:47,980
Jones, you may not say to this jury that you comply with discovery that is not true.

888
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:50,260
You may not say it again.

889
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:55,230
You may not tell this jury that you are bankrupt.

890
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:57,580
That is also not true.

891
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:01,670
You may have filed for bankruptcy.

892
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:03,230
I don't know that.

893
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:09,230
But I've heard that it doesn't make a person or a company bankrupt.

894
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:16,830
You're already under oath to tell the truth.

895
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:21,800
You've already violated that oath twice today.

896
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:24,430
Just those two examples.

897
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:33,010
It seems absurd to instruct you again that you must tell the truth while you testify.

898
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:34,422
Yet here I am.

899
00:58:34,556 --> 00:58:37,678
You must tell the truth while you testify.

900
00:58:37,834 --> 00:58:40,220
This is not your show.

901
00:58:42,570 --> 00:59:02,820
You need to slow down and not take what you see as opportunities to further the message you're wanting to further and instead only answer the specific and exact question you have been asked.

902
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:03,514
No.

903
00:59:03,552 --> 00:59:15,600
Asides the comments about discovery, the comments about the larynx or whatever it was, the comments about bankruptcy, none of those were responsive to questions.

904
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:27,610
They were just you abusing my tolerance and making a side for the to read improperly and in these two cases, untruthfully.

905
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:35,614
Do you understand what I have said? Yes or no? Do you understand what I have said? Yes.

906
00:59:35,712 --> 00:59:37,260
I believe what I said was true.

907
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:41,018
Yes, you believe everything you say is true, but it isn't.

908
00:59:41,114 --> 00:59:43,560
Your beliefs do not make something true.

909
00:59:44,670 --> 00:59:47,040
That is what we're doing here.

910
00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:51,550
Just because you claim to think something is true does not make it true.

911
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:53,098
It does not protect you.

912
00:59:53,184 --> 00:59:54,914
It is not allowed.

913
00:59:55,082 --> 00:59:56,162
You are under oath.

914
00:59:56,246 --> 00:59:59,940
That means things must actually be true when you say them.

915
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:01,260
Don't talk.

916
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:05,338
You understand what I have said? I do understand.

917
01:00:05,484 --> 01:00:08,258
The don't talk there is so intense.

918
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:09,000
Yeah.

919
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:13,714
I believe what I said was true.

920
01:00:13,872 --> 01:00:21,170
And the response to that is at the crux of why debate with someone like Alex is pointless.

921
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:31,858
There is a complete disconnect from any objectivity, any belief in a reality that exists outside of what you want to be true.

922
01:00:31,944 --> 01:00:32,580
Right.

923
01:00:32,910 --> 01:00:36,422
And that is hard in a courtroom setting.

924
01:00:36,506 --> 01:00:36,862
Yeah.

925
01:00:36,936 --> 01:00:44,770
I mean, we've said before that any communication begins with the definition of terms kind of thing, but that cannot be possible.

926
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:50,654
If somebody is speaking bird while you're trying to speak English, you can't be like, oh, okay, cheap.

927
01:00:50,702 --> 01:00:52,954
Cheap means no, it's just not going to happen.

928
01:00:53,052 --> 01:00:54,838
Yeah, you can't do it.

929
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:55,438
I can.

930
01:00:55,464 --> 01:00:56,398
I can talk to birds matter.

931
01:00:56,424 --> 01:01:02,806
I mean, it is satisfying to hear somebody have to be like, listen, objective reality is real.

932
01:01:02,868 --> 01:01:08,558
I don't know how to like she's flabbergasted by the idea that that needs to be introduced into court.

933
01:01:08,594 --> 01:01:14,230
I have to introduce to you bedrock concepts of object permanence.

934
01:01:14,910 --> 01:01:19,474
Is this a desk? Tell me what is and is not for you so we can continue.

935
01:01:19,572 --> 01:01:20,194
Don't speak.

936
01:01:20,292 --> 01:01:20,940
Exactly.

937
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:35,042
I was subject to this as well, the notion of Alex being under oath in the first deposition that came out.

938
01:01:35,176 --> 01:01:40,130
There's a lot of people who are excited about the idea that Alex is finally going to not be able to lie.

939
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:41,198
Right.

940
01:01:41,344 --> 01:01:44,682
And I myself was intrigued by the possibility.

941
01:01:44,766 --> 01:01:45,158
Maybe.

942
01:01:45,244 --> 01:01:46,262
And I think through.

943
01:01:46,336 --> 01:01:55,890
Watching them and engaging with the trial as it proceeded, I was not expecting the same things that a lot of people might have out of this trial.

944
01:01:55,950 --> 01:01:56,282
Right.

945
01:01:56,356 --> 01:02:04,374
And I feel for the judge, for sure, having to preside over this is an impossible task.

946
01:02:04,542 --> 01:02:16,960
And the notion that I think a lot of people are entering this with or the perception is that this trial doesn't exist in the context of the case that preceded it.

947
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:24,280
You see her being kind of annoyed, and it's because Alex has pulled this shit over and over and over and over again.

948
01:02:25,270 --> 01:02:35,930
I think in one interview that I did, I can't remember who it was with, but I made a point that she looks like she's pissed off, but she's being so patient.

949
01:02:36,610 --> 01:02:39,054
The context of this is missing.

950
01:02:39,162 --> 01:02:40,590
If you only watch the trial.

951
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:40,874
Yeah.

952
01:02:40,912 --> 01:03:04,730
And if you only watch the trial, I could understand coming away from it with the perception that she's not giving Alex an inch or whatever, but there's a reason, and that's unfortunate that there's not a previously on before the trial, and it is such a thing where she is doing such a great job because she is giving so much preferential treatment to the defense.

953
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:07,622
And let me try to explain that better.

954
01:03:07,696 --> 01:03:08,738
That sounds like you.

955
01:03:08,824 --> 01:03:09,434
Right.

956
01:03:09,592 --> 01:03:20,046
So if Alex was a normal person, the fourth time you tell them they can't lie on the stand, there has to be some consequences.

957
01:03:20,118 --> 01:03:21,330
That's when you bring out the stocks.

958
01:03:21,390 --> 01:03:21,866
Exactly.

959
01:03:21,988 --> 01:03:24,758
Do you know what I'm saying? But a normal person would never let it get that far.

960
01:03:24,784 --> 01:03:31,646
So we don't even know how to deal with this, because if you do that, that's what he wants.

961
01:03:31,708 --> 01:03:35,442
He wants you to say, oh, I have to go to jail for lying.

962
01:03:35,526 --> 01:03:37,650
They're locking me up for telling the truth.

963
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:38,114
Right.

964
01:03:38,212 --> 01:03:39,482
That's what you're going for.

965
01:03:39,556 --> 01:03:44,020
Like, hey, Alex, why don't you put that bumper sticker on your mouth? For real? Absolutely.

966
01:03:44,410 --> 01:03:45,086
Just talk.

967
01:03:45,148 --> 01:03:54,594
So there's just this constant push and pull between her being like, I have to treat you like a screaming, whiny baby, and at the same time, I have to treat this like we're in an actual courtroom.

968
01:03:54,642 --> 01:03:59,270
Yeah, you have to be treated like a screaming, whiny baby because that's what your behavior is.

969
01:03:59,320 --> 01:03:59,606
Exactly.

970
01:03:59,668 --> 01:04:05,670
And at the same time, you have to be treated like an adult because you're facing adult consequences for your adult actions.

971
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:09,602
And yes, it's a difficult position to be in.

972
01:04:09,796 --> 01:04:10,970
I'm not jealous of that.

973
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:17,754
There's a lot that she wouldn't have ever allowed the plaintiffs to get away with legally simply because she's like, you're adult.

974
01:04:17,802 --> 01:04:29,814
I have to hold you to a standard that I'm not holding these fourth graders to and that she did give them that preferential treatment is both, like, starkly unfair and yet at the same time, the only way to have this trial.

975
01:04:29,862 --> 01:04:42,006
Well, to be totally fair, I don't know if it's appropriate to call it preferential treatment, but gave a lot of patients a lot of wide birth.

976
01:04:42,078 --> 01:04:42,700
Sure.

977
01:04:43,030 --> 01:04:43,802
All right.

978
01:04:43,936 --> 01:04:52,490
I'm not going to hold you in contempt for clearly lying under oath, for doing the thing that we hold people in contempt for.

979
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:53,150
Right.

980
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:58,554
There was a lot of generous approach to punishing Alex.

981
01:04:58,602 --> 01:04:58,850
Right.

982
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:00,794
And he still couldn't operate within that space.

983
01:05:00,832 --> 01:05:01,766
He couldn't do it.

984
01:05:01,888 --> 01:05:07,838
So we go to the second day now, because this is where they took the break for the day.

985
01:05:07,864 --> 01:05:08,910
It was about 05:00.

986
01:05:08,970 --> 01:05:09,338
Right.

987
01:05:09,424 --> 01:05:13,998
And so Alex returns under oath, and there's still the direct questioning.

988
01:05:14,034 --> 01:05:17,042
Raynal is still giving him questions.

989
01:05:17,116 --> 01:05:23,786
And unfortunately, the law and crime video of this is missing the first ten minutes or so.

990
01:05:23,968 --> 01:05:33,206
And so the beginning of this is establishing that Alex kind of, like, had less connection with those weirdos than maybe he actually did.

991
01:05:33,268 --> 01:05:33,674
Right.

992
01:05:33,772 --> 01:05:39,978
This is the part where he's trying to say that he didn't know Steve or Wolfgang, especially not the Kraken.

993
01:05:40,134 --> 01:05:41,894
Steve under the bus pretty hard.

994
01:05:41,992 --> 01:05:42,494
Real quick.

995
01:05:42,532 --> 01:05:45,450
I would not be happy if I was steve reached out for comment.

996
01:05:45,570 --> 01:06:10,638
Steve on the subject, which is funny, because in the first week of the trial, steve patentic was one of the names that Raynall brought up to Becca being like, whenever he was on his array of, do you think this person's a racist? Do you think this person's a racist? Do you think CVP's name come up as, like, a defendable name along with Stefan Molyneux? It was absurd.

997
01:06:10,674 --> 01:06:12,820
Is Stefan Molyneux racist? Yes.

998
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:14,898
He said so real loud.

999
01:06:14,934 --> 01:06:15,282
It's, Steve.

1000
01:06:15,306 --> 01:06:16,550
Pichenic a racist.

1001
01:06:18,730 --> 01:06:21,314
Weird feelings about Jewish people.

1002
01:06:21,472 --> 01:06:22,250
Hate them.

1003
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:37,242
So the beginning portion of this is really trying to downplay the connections and Alex's associations with the major players, and some of them, I think, are kind of like, you could actually get away with this.

1004
01:06:37,316 --> 01:06:41,350
I don't think him and James Tracy had that much connection.

1005
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:41,634
Sure.

1006
01:06:41,672 --> 01:06:42,234
I can see that.

1007
01:06:42,272 --> 01:06:53,374
And I think Alex should be hanging his hat far more on the fact that Paul Joseph Watson's interview with James Tracy, the initial one was a little bit adversarial.

1008
01:06:53,422 --> 01:06:54,102
Yeah.

1009
01:06:54,296 --> 01:06:57,930
Maybe not as much as an actual responsible journalist would.

1010
01:06:57,980 --> 01:06:58,662
Sure.

1011
01:06:58,856 --> 01:07:01,822
Paul did push back on the idea that there were actors.

1012
01:07:01,906 --> 01:07:02,540
Right.

1013
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:09,260
In the same way the court grades on a curve for the fifth graders, paul has proven himself to be in 7th grade strong.

1014
01:07:09,770 --> 01:07:18,006
So Steve does come up here, and Alex has an interesting perception on what he did during that time.

1015
01:07:18,068 --> 01:07:22,338
You interviewed Steve Pachanic about the story.

1016
01:07:22,424 --> 01:07:30,380
Why did you pick him? Did you reach out to him? Did he reach out to you? How did that I reviewed the video, but it was a few weeks ago.

1017
01:07:30,770 --> 01:07:41,610
I believe he was on other subjects, and I believe it came up, and then I think I argued with him about it being totally staged.

1018
01:07:42,590 --> 01:07:43,782
Sound hard to believe.

1019
01:07:43,916 --> 01:07:45,334
This isn't really accurate.

1020
01:07:45,442 --> 01:07:53,338
Alex didn't argue with Steve but it would be a mischaracterization to say that he gave Steve a full backing in his claims.

1021
01:07:53,374 --> 01:07:53,718
Right.

1022
01:07:53,804 --> 01:07:58,354
Alex was interested in the theories and was like, oh, we got a top expert saying it's fake.

1023
01:07:58,462 --> 01:08:01,222
But he didn't really commit to it in that interview.

1024
01:08:01,366 --> 01:08:03,330
And Steve was on for something else.

1025
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:11,250
He was pretending to be Alex's on the scene reporter in the Demilitarized Zone because Alex was trying to drum up panic about how North Korea was going to start a nuclear war.

1026
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:11,718
Oh, God.

1027
01:08:11,744 --> 01:08:12,606
I remember that.

1028
01:08:12,668 --> 01:08:15,090
He said he was in Korea.

1029
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:24,538
He said he was inside hanging out with soldiers from both sides of the country of Korea, from Florida.

1030
01:08:24,574 --> 01:08:25,520
He claimed that.

1031
01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:28,470
I have no evidence.

1032
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:40,086
He might have no, I think that there is a really decent chance that he was on a vacation to South Korea, because I have seen some pictures that he posted of him in various all right.

1033
01:08:40,208 --> 01:08:41,506
Touristy places.

1034
01:08:41,698 --> 01:08:42,390
Well done.

1035
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:43,254
I'll give you that one.

1036
01:08:43,292 --> 01:08:44,130
That's possible.

1037
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:46,546
And then he just pretended he was at the DMZ.

1038
01:08:46,618 --> 01:08:47,300
All right.

1039
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:50,266
I'm not doing DMZ, but I'll give him vacation.

1040
01:08:50,338 --> 01:08:51,210
Yeah, I think that's possible.

1041
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:51,726
Okay.

1042
01:08:51,848 --> 01:09:03,906
So in this course of questioning, I think that Alex the goal that he had was to present this image that his life was really in trouble around the time that Sandy Hook happened.

1043
01:09:03,968 --> 01:09:04,820
Poor me.

1044
01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:05,946
Yeah.

1045
01:09:06,068 --> 01:09:25,080
Can you tell us what led you to have Wolf Bang How Big on in 2014? He was on a lot of shows, and he had a group of bullet points, and my producer set him up all the shows, so I had him on at the time.

1046
01:09:25,590 --> 01:09:32,350
What, if anything, else, was going on in your life? My family was falling apart.

1047
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:36,974
I was so weird.

1048
01:09:37,142 --> 01:09:45,854
Attempt to paint a picture of, like, if you weren't getting divorced, you wouldn't have booked Wolfgang How Big on your show? Yeah, that's weird.

1049
01:09:46,022 --> 01:09:47,930
This got weird.

1050
01:09:48,110 --> 01:09:48,454
Yeah.

1051
01:09:48,492 --> 01:10:07,082
This whole section where his whole Woe is me thing was I know that they wanted it to come off as though he was, like, a person who was also suffering, but it really just came off more like, are you going to do this here? Yeah, it was strange.

1052
01:10:07,166 --> 01:10:07,800
Yeah.

1053
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:12,698
And he also tries to blame Steve more, which, if I were Steve, I would not appreciate.

1054
01:10:12,794 --> 01:10:18,254
And I would probably attack Alex because you're a crazy old man, and you got nothing to lose.

1055
01:10:18,302 --> 01:10:33,430
Why not? We've had a video received in evidence of you stating your belief at that time that no one died at Sandy Hook, that the whole thing was fake.

1056
01:10:34,170 --> 01:10:45,950
Do you understand, as you sit here today, how crazy that is? I have said before that there have been so many lies and so many things in the past, and I was under a lot of pressure.

1057
01:10:46,070 --> 01:11:03,060
And I truly when I said those statements, when I say something, I mean it, except for what my wife totally stays at that point, and I was basing that off of, really, Steve Hochinic, who has been a very prestigious person.

1058
01:11:03,450 --> 01:11:07,846
You understand now that it was absolutely irresponsible to do that.

1059
01:11:07,908 --> 01:11:08,494
It was.

1060
01:11:08,592 --> 01:11:10,190
Especially since I met the parents.

1061
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:13,714
And it's just 100% real.

1062
01:11:13,812 --> 01:11:19,020
As I said on the radio yesterday, and as I said here yesterday, it's 100% real.

1063
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:24,842
And the media still ran with lies that I was saying it wasn't real on air yesterday.

1064
01:11:24,926 --> 01:11:25,874
It's incredible.

1065
01:11:25,982 --> 01:11:28,150
They won't let me take it back.

1066
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:31,622
They just want to keep me in the position of being with Sandy Hookman.

1067
01:11:31,766 --> 01:11:33,530
My son got confronted yesterday.

1068
01:11:33,650 --> 01:11:34,178
Objection.

1069
01:11:34,214 --> 01:11:35,950
Speculation is what the media wants.

1070
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:36,250
Mr.

1071
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:39,466
Jones is just a test being on the show in a game.

1072
01:11:39,648 --> 01:11:42,514
What is me? Alex is the real victim here.

1073
01:11:42,552 --> 01:11:46,862
Although I think Steve needs to get on YouTube and cut a video about Alex.

1074
01:11:46,946 --> 01:11:48,382
Something throwing him under the bus.

1075
01:11:48,456 --> 01:11:53,722
Yeah, he wants to be the one the media claims the Sandy Hook man.

1076
01:11:53,856 --> 01:11:54,334
Yeah.

1077
01:11:54,432 --> 01:11:55,258
Come on.

1078
01:11:55,404 --> 01:11:56,306
Come on, Steve.

1079
01:11:56,378 --> 01:11:56,722
Wow.

1080
01:11:56,796 --> 01:11:58,142
Start a public battle.

1081
01:11:58,226 --> 01:12:00,550
That would be great for both of them.

1082
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,506
Yeah, but mostly for me.

1083
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:09,182
But then who's David Nike going to side with? Boy, I feel like it's all old dudes against Alex.

1084
01:12:09,326 --> 01:12:09,850
Okay.

1085
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:11,738
Old dudes against Alex's.

1086
01:12:11,774 --> 01:12:12,470
Young guards.

1087
01:12:12,530 --> 01:12:13,930
Shirts versus skin.

1088
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:19,150
I would like to see David Knight and Steve Bochanic reach Dayton.

1089
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:22,320
That would be nice.

1090
01:12:23,670 --> 01:12:26,050
Desire to spill the tea on Alex.

1091
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:30,454
A final team up of grumpy old men.

1092
01:12:30,492 --> 01:12:31,558
Three also kind of thing.

1093
01:12:31,584 --> 01:12:37,426
By the way, is this the first time that Daytone and spill the tea have been used at the same time? I don't know.

1094
01:12:37,548 --> 01:12:38,002
I don't know.

1095
01:12:38,016 --> 01:12:47,690
The French had a lot of things to say, correct? What? No, that's going off the rail.

1096
01:12:48,910 --> 01:12:51,426
This is a testimony worthy of this trial.

1097
01:12:51,558 --> 01:13:02,510
So Alex says something about his realization that Sandy Hook was real in this next clip, and I found this deeply troubling at the end or at the middle of 2015.

1098
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:11,626
In July 2015, you stopped info were stopped covering Sandy Hook.

1099
01:13:11,818 --> 01:13:12,560
Yes.

1100
01:13:13,070 --> 01:13:23,586
Why did you stop? Because Halbig was saying that I was involved in Sandy Hook because I wouldn't have him on.

1101
01:13:23,648 --> 01:13:28,100
And I started finding out that some of the things that the anomalies they had put forward weren't true.

1102
01:13:28,610 --> 01:13:45,678
And I had just ended my divorce and just kind of got my head cleaned up and stopped drinking for a while and realized that it probably did happen and there was a good chance I was wrong.

1103
01:13:45,824 --> 01:13:52,714
So I started basically trying to walk it back long before I got sued because I wasn't sure that I was right anymore.

1104
01:13:52,882 --> 01:13:54,238
Not everything's a false flag.

1105
01:13:54,274 --> 01:13:55,510
Not everything is staged.

1106
01:13:55,630 --> 01:14:03,070
So this is disturbing because there does seem to be a pattern of Alex discussing his drinking as it relates to his actions involving Sandy Hook.

1107
01:14:03,190 --> 01:14:09,642
We've seen it in an interview and now under oath, and honestly, it's indicative of a very serious substance abuse problem.

1108
01:14:09,836 --> 01:14:10,930
Drunk or sober.

1109
01:14:10,990 --> 01:14:19,426
Alex is an asshole and deserves the consequences of his actions, but I want to draw sharp focus to the difference in how Alex talks about the issue depending on his surroundings.

1110
01:14:19,618 --> 01:14:27,020
Here in court, Alex is discussing his realization that Sandy Hook actually happened about some time in 2015.

1111
01:14:27,350 --> 01:14:37,626
There's absolutely no prompt for him to bring up that he'd stopped drinking for a while as an explanation for his supposed period of clarity, but he does, which leads me to believe that it means something to him.

1112
01:14:37,748 --> 01:14:44,922
I don't think that it's true, but I do believe that he probably was going through a lot and stopped drinking for a while around the end of 2015.

1113
01:14:45,116 --> 01:14:49,806
This is all being said in service of humanizing Alex and minimizing the things that he did.

1114
01:14:49,988 --> 01:14:56,110
He was going through a lot and was drinking a ton, but once he got sober, he realized that he was wrong and changed his behaviors.

1115
01:14:56,230 --> 01:14:57,958
Except in reality, he didn't.

1116
01:14:58,054 --> 01:15:04,002
He was still doing his show wasted years past this point, and he didn't change his behavior in any meaningful way.

1117
01:15:04,136 --> 01:15:08,914
He still just ran with bullshit stories from bullshit sources and defame people regularly.

1118
01:15:09,022 --> 01:15:17,014
But he wants the perception to be that this was just a bad pocket in his life when all these negative influences led him to drink and his judgment was weakened.

1119
01:15:17,122 --> 01:15:28,110
He doesn't want the jury to know that he got right back to the heavy drinking and bullshitting with Steve Patanick basically the next week, because that kind of cheapens whatever fake display of penitents he's trying to put on here.

1120
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:32,814
But the other time Alex discussed his drinking in relation to Sandy Hook was a lot different.

1121
01:15:32,972 --> 01:15:43,230
In the Glen Greenwald Q and A, alex was joking about how he defamed grieving parents and caused immeasurable pain in their lives by saying that he didn't know what he was doing and drank a bottle of vodka that day.

1122
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:46,110
It wasn't a person expressing this as a negative thing.

1123
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:52,930
It was Alex trying to appear cool because he wanted to impress the cool kids like Greenwald who can give them access to a new audience.

1124
01:15:53,110 --> 01:16:09,066
I find this dynamic deeply upsetting, and the only conclusion I can come to is that Alex was drinking on air a lot during this stretch and that he probably has a way bigger problem than even I think, and I have been chastised for begging people in his life to get him help a bunch in the past.

1125
01:16:09,128 --> 01:16:09,786
That's true.

1126
01:16:09,908 --> 01:16:13,366
Anyway, a lot of this falls on deaf ears to me in a courtroom setting.

1127
01:16:13,498 --> 01:16:21,390
I would take him more seriously if he took the tone that he did in the Q and A while on the stand, but that's not going to happen because there's no cool kids to impress there.

1128
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:25,350
Yeah, but if he was on the stand, he's like, I drank a bottle of vodka.

1129
01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:29,120
I would be like, all right, this is interesting.

1130
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:40,614
Being an asshole consistent how do you say that in a courtroom? How do you do that? Because to me, what you just said is, nah, come on, it wasn't that bad.

1131
01:16:40,652 --> 01:16:42,478
Whenever I hit him, I was drunk driving.

1132
01:16:42,574 --> 01:16:43,122
Right.

1133
01:16:43,256 --> 01:16:56,302
I don't know how you say that in a courtroom in a situation that is ostensibly you also say that you believe it's 100% real, but you are only drunk driving because you're in an ugly divorce.

1134
01:16:56,386 --> 01:16:57,102
Exactly.

1135
01:16:57,296 --> 01:16:59,890
But even then, you're saying it's really his ex wife's fault.

1136
01:16:59,950 --> 01:17:05,550
You're saying that you said that when you were drunk, and now you're saying that it's 100% real.

1137
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:13,890
Are you drunk or are you sober? And does it matter? If that's your reasoning here, then it doesn't matter.

1138
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:16,662
When they reported it was 100% true.

1139
01:17:16,736 --> 01:17:21,318
There's a part of me that's like, well, was he drunk? Because that doesn't mean yeah, right.

1140
01:17:21,464 --> 01:17:24,138
Then what? It means the same amount either way.

1141
01:17:24,284 --> 01:17:24,980
Right.

1142
01:17:25,670 --> 01:17:32,970
It's just a way for him to contextualize his actions by looking at his past self as the drunk self.

1143
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:33,390
Exactly.

1144
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:34,722
And that's not me.

1145
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:38,514
No, that can be definitely true for people who get help.

1146
01:17:38,612 --> 01:17:39,306
Sure.

1147
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:45,918
I'm not saying that who you are when you're in your addiction is necessarily who you have to for the rest of your life.

1148
01:17:45,944 --> 01:17:48,978
Sure, recovery is possible and all that, right.

1149
01:17:49,004 --> 01:17:51,042
But Alex has not done any of that stuff.

1150
01:17:51,176 --> 01:17:58,818
And so him trying to pretend like this past self is somebody that I own up to being but it is not characteristic of me.

1151
01:17:58,964 --> 01:18:00,838
It's a false perception.

1152
01:18:00,874 --> 01:18:05,622
It's an abuse of people's understanding of absolute abuse problems.

1153
01:18:05,696 --> 01:18:06,320
Yes.

1154
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:11,022
Mike Tyson on his fucking show a month ago or whatever.

1155
01:18:11,096 --> 01:18:20,574
No, I mean, part of listen, you do have to own up to consequences for your behavior regardless of whether you are an addict or not.

1156
01:18:20,612 --> 01:18:21,838
That's part of recovery.

1157
01:18:21,934 --> 01:18:23,502
That's part of what it is.

1158
01:18:23,636 --> 01:18:27,826
And he's not even owning up to his behavior in a fucking courtroom.

1159
01:18:27,898 --> 01:18:28,278
Right.

1160
01:18:28,364 --> 01:18:28,758
Yeah.

1161
01:18:28,844 --> 01:18:33,418
Because all this is ingenuine and just an attempt to feel less bad about himself.

1162
01:18:33,454 --> 01:18:34,040
Absolutely.

1163
01:18:34,490 --> 01:18:37,938
This whole situation is not about the parents for him.

1164
01:18:37,964 --> 01:18:41,178
It is entirely about him trying to feel good about him.

1165
01:18:41,204 --> 01:18:41,358
Yeah.

1166
01:18:41,384 --> 01:18:43,674
And trying to make rationalizations for things.

1167
01:18:43,712 --> 01:18:44,202
Yeah.

1168
01:18:44,336 --> 01:18:46,230
So the crack in comes up.

1169
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:47,422
Dan Bodandy.

1170
01:18:47,566 --> 01:18:50,970
Alex definitely does not want to be associated with him, which makes sense.

1171
01:18:51,020 --> 01:18:51,558
Yeah.

1172
01:18:51,704 --> 01:18:58,618
During that time, there was a reporter working there's, a gentleman who at least we've had yeah, you shouldn't have said reporter.

1173
01:18:58,654 --> 01:19:04,038
Remember at some point for info wars named Dan Vedandi? Are you familiar with that name? Yes.

1174
01:19:04,184 --> 01:19:09,270
Can you tell us who he is? He was a part time reporter.

1175
01:19:10,190 --> 01:19:17,300
We're supposed to say that it was a really nice guy, but we were being more comedy based part of the show then.

1176
01:19:17,690 --> 01:19:25,458
And so Rob's, like, this guy is like a Howard Stern character, and so we hired him to do some funny stuff that he wanted to do, serious stuff.

1177
01:19:25,604 --> 01:19:27,380
Oh, man, he's like your whack pack.

1178
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:34,018
So the comedy that Dan Vidanti was doing was things like going to that foyer hearing with Wolfgang Halbig.

1179
01:19:34,054 --> 01:19:34,570
Hilarious.

1180
01:19:34,630 --> 01:19:35,722
Hilarious, hilarious.

1181
01:19:35,746 --> 01:19:46,762
Or like when he interrupted the Boston bombing, the press conference police were giving while the Zarnett brothers were still on the loose and unidentified.

1182
01:19:46,846 --> 01:19:47,022
Right.

1183
01:19:47,036 --> 01:19:50,814
But at least he didn't say that he was specifically harassing people.

1184
01:19:50,912 --> 01:19:53,302
He said he was being a hilarious jokester.

1185
01:19:53,326 --> 01:19:53,802
Right.

1186
01:19:53,936 --> 01:19:58,602
I mean, look, this is such bullshit for every reason.

1187
01:19:58,676 --> 01:20:00,810
Oh, man, so many reasons.

1188
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:04,686
And Alex saying that he didn't approve of this stuff.

1189
01:20:04,748 --> 01:20:15,942
Go back and listen to those Boston bombing episodes where he's like, over the moon and just, like, celebrating Dan Bodandi interrupting this press conference and yelling infowars.com.

1190
01:20:16,016 --> 01:20:19,158
Yes, you approved of all of it.

1191
01:20:19,244 --> 01:20:21,522
You're making a joke of serious things.

1192
01:20:21,656 --> 01:20:26,218
That's what you were doing with him, and you just don't want to own up to the pain it caused.

1193
01:20:26,254 --> 01:20:26,742
Yeah.

1194
01:20:26,876 --> 01:20:32,506
So this whole defense has largely circled around the idea that you have to watch the full clips.

1195
01:20:32,638 --> 01:20:37,606
So at this point, Raynal puts on a very long video of Alex's.

1196
01:20:37,678 --> 01:20:50,874
Now, the things that are a problem here, some of them we're going to get into, but also the video includes Alex repeating the claim that Wolfgang Halbig correct.

1197
01:20:50,972 --> 01:20:51,558
Said so.

1198
01:20:51,584 --> 01:20:53,338
This is supposed to be his big apology.

1199
01:20:53,494 --> 01:20:58,470
At the same time, he's like, why did the school have no traffic online? Yeah, okay.

1200
01:20:58,580 --> 01:21:00,018
You know all this isn't true.

1201
01:21:00,104 --> 01:21:04,474
Yeah, it was wild for them to insist on playing the full clip.

1202
01:21:04,522 --> 01:21:08,266
The full clip of which was more damning than the shorter clip.

1203
01:21:08,338 --> 01:21:21,126
Yeah, I would argue so outside of just the repetition of Wolfgang's points and the conspiracies around Sandy Hook, which I don't think helped their case.

1204
01:21:21,188 --> 01:21:21,702
No.

1205
01:21:21,836 --> 01:21:24,738
There were some other things that I thought would be interesting to point out.

1206
01:21:24,764 --> 01:21:26,022
Here's the first one.

1207
01:21:26,216 --> 01:21:28,086
So let's look at these stories here.

1208
01:21:28,148 --> 01:21:33,438
I do Benjarras and cartoon based, of course, on my original term, dinosaur media.

1209
01:21:33,524 --> 01:21:34,858
You've got ISIS working with Ms.

1210
01:21:34,894 --> 01:21:35,914
Mcnn.

1211
01:21:36,082 --> 01:21:36,994
You've got NBC.

1212
01:21:37,042 --> 01:21:38,754
They got it in the water hole getting their money.

1213
01:21:38,852 --> 01:21:40,402
And here comes Stefan Molyneux.

1214
01:21:40,426 --> 01:21:41,758
Here comes Paul Watson.

1215
01:21:41,914 --> 01:21:43,870
Here comes Cernovich.

1216
01:21:43,930 --> 01:21:45,346
Here comes the infowars.

1217
01:21:45,478 --> 01:21:46,438
Here comes Drudge.

1218
01:21:46,474 --> 01:21:47,502
Here comes my part.

1219
01:21:47,636 --> 01:21:52,460
Yeah, back then, Molyneux was completely, totally fine.

1220
01:21:54,810 --> 01:21:56,590
I am a white nationalist.

1221
01:21:57,270 --> 01:21:58,930
Paul Joseph Watson.

1222
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:03,274
You had a real different climate in the time that Alex made this video.

1223
01:22:03,312 --> 01:22:03,862
So different.

1224
01:22:03,936 --> 01:22:07,438
Yeah, all those players are so different.

1225
01:22:07,524 --> 01:22:12,686
Well, I mean, they didn't have to snub Molyneux because he spoke a little bit too openly.

1226
01:22:12,758 --> 01:22:14,666
Shouldn't have spoken like a Molyneux.

1227
01:22:14,678 --> 01:22:15,446
I'd be pissed.

1228
01:22:15,518 --> 01:22:17,390
I know all you assholes.

1229
01:22:17,450 --> 01:22:19,510
All of you guys are open white nationalists now.

1230
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:35,414
Why don't I get to be coming back? Did you ever see that video of Owen Benjamin after the intellectual dark web started not liking him? There's a video of him drinking beer and complaining about all the intellectual dark web people who don't like him anymore because he got kicked off Twitter.

1231
01:22:35,462 --> 01:22:36,142
Right.

1232
01:22:36,336 --> 01:22:37,882
It's just the same thing.

1233
01:22:38,016 --> 01:22:39,826
I understand that.

1234
01:22:40,008 --> 01:22:40,606
Yes.

1235
01:22:40,728 --> 01:22:46,990
You should be pissed off at your friends who don't like you anymore because you spoke too openly about the things that you all believe.

1236
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:48,326
You all believe the same shit.

1237
01:22:48,398 --> 01:22:49,260
Yes, absolutely.

1238
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:55,246
You just said some slurs, and all of a sudden, you're too toxic to be a part of.

1239
01:22:55,308 --> 01:22:58,114
I feel like Stefan Molyneux should definitely feel that way.

1240
01:22:58,212 --> 01:23:10,018
Like, the content that he was putting out when everybody was buddy buddy with him is just as offensive as the stuff that he puts out later is a little bit clearer later.

1241
01:23:10,164 --> 01:23:16,246
I think the way that I would describe the feeling that they must have is like they're all over the line.

1242
01:23:16,308 --> 01:23:21,194
Like, these are all people who are Wiley Coyote, who have already jumped off the edge of the cliff.

1243
01:23:21,302 --> 01:23:26,270
And if you say the slur, that's like you telling everybody else, oh, look, we're floating.

1244
01:23:26,330 --> 01:23:29,830
And then you fall, and they're like, Good thing we're not floating.

1245
01:23:30,570 --> 01:23:32,846
We're just standing on solid ground.

1246
01:23:32,918 --> 01:23:34,918
Honestly, I was never running with that guy to be yeah.

1247
01:23:34,944 --> 01:23:36,958
I've never even seen look at how far down he is.

1248
01:23:37,044 --> 01:23:38,662
It's crazy how far down he is.

1249
01:23:38,736 --> 01:23:39,262
Yeah.

1250
01:23:39,396 --> 01:23:44,518
So Alex discusses in this clip that they're playing in court this coverage of him.

1251
01:23:44,544 --> 01:23:46,080
That is actually pretty good.

1252
01:23:47,010 --> 01:23:50,110
There's one person who's done a great job.

1253
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:58,694
This is an excellent article from Zero Hedge, alice Jones implores NBC not to air interview with liar Meghan Kelly.

1254
01:23:58,742 --> 01:24:00,394
This article, better than anyone I've seen.

1255
01:24:00,432 --> 01:24:04,318
I want to post on impuls.com exactly how I feel.

1256
01:24:04,464 --> 01:24:08,486
What's actually happened is from Ibankcoin.com originally.

1257
01:24:08,678 --> 01:24:10,858
It's from Zero point now as he posted it.

1258
01:24:10,944 --> 01:24:16,430
This article, I need to get this person to write for Info Wars journalists.

1259
01:24:16,490 --> 01:24:18,034
They actually reported on what I said.

1260
01:24:18,132 --> 01:24:29,038
They showed my quotes going back over years saying, I don't know what happened, but it's got more holes out of Swiss cheese, and I believe kids die, but it needs to be investigated, and there's definitely a cover up.

1261
01:24:29,124 --> 01:24:36,650
Zero Point Now is the person who wrote the article that Owen was relying on when he defamed Tesla.

1262
01:24:36,710 --> 01:24:37,320
Yes.

1263
01:24:38,010 --> 01:24:40,082
Owen is zero point Now's puppet.

1264
01:24:40,226 --> 01:24:40,920
Yeah.

1265
01:24:41,730 --> 01:24:43,066
Literally zero point.

1266
01:24:43,128 --> 01:24:44,978
I bank coin according to under oath.

1267
01:24:45,014 --> 01:24:46,150
Owen under oath.

1268
01:24:46,590 --> 01:24:47,558
He's his puppet.

1269
01:24:47,654 --> 01:24:47,878
Yeah.

1270
01:24:47,904 --> 01:25:00,814
So it's just interesting to see this pop up here, because this is also in a very close time frame with when Owen made that video, because Alex is talking about how he doesn't want the Megyn Kelly interview to air.

1271
01:25:00,912 --> 01:25:01,138
Right.

1272
01:25:01,164 --> 01:25:06,110
So it's after he shot it, but before it airs it's in that pocket.

1273
01:25:06,170 --> 01:25:13,894
And then Owen shoots that video pretty much closely after the Megan Kelly interview errors as a response to it.

1274
01:25:13,932 --> 01:25:22,678
So what you have here is Alex wanting to hire the person who wrote the article that Owen relied on to create defamatory content.

1275
01:25:22,764 --> 01:25:23,482
Yeah.

1276
01:25:23,676 --> 01:25:24,420
Fun.

1277
01:25:25,050 --> 01:25:25,882
Yeah.

1278
01:25:26,076 --> 01:25:42,178
It is amazing to me that, one, the defense only used the plaintiff's evidence, which is usually a bad sign, and two, that in so doing, they have made the plaintiff's case really well.

1279
01:25:42,324 --> 01:25:43,654
I would think so, yeah.

1280
01:25:43,752 --> 01:25:50,138
So Reynold comes back, and he wants to have Alex say that Sandy Hook is real and not a conspiracy.

1281
01:25:50,174 --> 01:25:51,874
He wants that so bad.

1282
01:25:51,972 --> 01:25:53,078
So here's the first attempt.

1283
01:25:53,114 --> 01:25:53,662
Here we go.

1284
01:25:53,736 --> 01:26:11,080
As you sit here today, what are your beliefs around the San Diego School street? I certainly studied it now, and I should have a better job studying it.

1285
01:26:12,190 --> 01:26:25,202
That's an apology, right? There was an initial cover up of what happened, in my view, because I'm sorry, wait, are you questioning Sandy Hook in the stance they're going to Uvaldi? Both children really died, and they had a cover up there.

1286
01:26:25,216 --> 01:26:28,478
It submitted there's now state investigations of the cover up.

1287
01:26:28,504 --> 01:26:37,360
Texas Rangers are on it, and the governor said it's an outrageous cover up and it's incompetence is what it was.

1288
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:43,402
And I thought it was incompetent.

1289
01:26:50,730 --> 01:27:03,046
What's the question? Alex Rambles gets caught off into talking about Uvaldi because he latches onto the idea of a cover up, and he feels the need to defend this cover up idea.

1290
01:27:03,108 --> 01:27:06,290
So he jumps to Uvaldi, gets an objection.

1291
01:27:06,350 --> 01:27:07,838
So now here's the second attempt.

1292
01:27:07,874 --> 01:27:09,034
Let's go for it again.

1293
01:27:09,192 --> 01:27:35,318
My question was, as you sit here today, what is your position, your view on what happened, the murders at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, a young man on psychotropic drugs, and the inserts on those sessions can make you do mass shootings, mass murders, as he says on the insert.

1294
01:27:35,414 --> 01:27:37,570
I think we're coming really close to Kentucky.

1295
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:39,420
Okay.

1296
01:27:39,810 --> 01:27:46,620
So Alex now says his pharmaceuticals talking point and feels the need to defend the pharmaceuticals talking.

1297
01:27:47,550 --> 01:27:52,690
And so he goes down that road, hits another objection, and so at this point, Raymond just gives up.

1298
01:27:52,740 --> 01:27:55,138
Yeah, he said, I'm going to move on.

1299
01:27:55,224 --> 01:28:00,994
And then Alex, of his own volition, decides to try a third time, and he whips it.

1300
01:28:01,032 --> 01:28:01,920
Here we go.

1301
01:28:03,510 --> 01:28:05,100
I think Sandy Hook happened.

1302
01:28:05,610 --> 01:28:11,710
I think it's a terrible event, and I think we need to protect our children from mentally ill psychopaths.

1303
01:28:12,150 --> 01:28:14,642
And I think there was a cover up because they had warnings.

1304
01:28:14,666 --> 01:28:15,898
The FBI knew about it.

1305
01:28:15,984 --> 01:28:20,602
They knew he was planning to attack the school that's been in even The New York Times.

1306
01:28:20,796 --> 01:28:27,480
And I think, well, right now there's actually no question.

1307
01:28:29,410 --> 01:28:30,506
And it's not a show.

1308
01:28:30,568 --> 01:28:34,898
It's a question answer to the question after you got it.

1309
01:28:34,984 --> 01:28:36,654
So that objection is sustained.

1310
01:28:36,702 --> 01:28:38,306
And we need another question.

1311
01:28:38,428 --> 01:28:38,678
Yeah.

1312
01:28:38,704 --> 01:28:42,866
So Alex had three tries there to say something very simple.

1313
01:28:42,928 --> 01:28:48,710
So simple, and could not help himself in creating conspiracy yarns.

1314
01:28:49,570 --> 01:28:51,510
So we have one last question from Raynall.

1315
01:28:51,570 --> 01:28:59,418
I just hope in my entire life that I never hear Mark say something with the amount of smile in his voice.

1316
01:28:59,574 --> 01:29:00,818
I don't ever want to hear that.

1317
01:29:00,844 --> 01:29:01,886
That's a bad sound.

1318
01:29:01,948 --> 01:29:03,054
Getting close to contempt.

1319
01:29:03,102 --> 01:29:04,106
That's a bad sound.

1320
01:29:04,168 --> 01:29:06,906
That makes me feel like some danger is around the corner.

1321
01:29:06,978 --> 01:29:08,882
Yeah, and it should, because it was.

1322
01:29:09,016 --> 01:29:14,750
So, like I said, Renault is one last question yes, that we're going to look at, and it's a doozy.

1323
01:29:15,310 --> 01:29:33,570
When you look back on your 20 plus years in the media, what are you most proud of? I'm most proud of 911 early on exposing that the WMDs weren't in Iraq and it was a fraud and it was a lie.

1324
01:29:33,630 --> 01:29:34,250
Close.

1325
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:43,566
And I'm very proud of being the first to expose Jeffrey Epstein and his child trafficking ranks.

1326
01:29:43,758 --> 01:29:51,342
We're on record be the first to expose that a decade before anybody else, by name even exposing the island and the rest of it from our sources.

1327
01:29:51,486 --> 01:30:00,794
So Alex definitely wasn't the first to report on WMDs in Iraq and the questionable intelligence surrounding the story, even though he was correct to be skeptical of that story.

1328
01:30:00,892 --> 01:30:04,458
His skepticism was childish and it was just a knee jerk response.

1329
01:30:04,554 --> 01:30:14,466
It wasn't based on anything other than his own Whim, so I guess he can brag that he got that one right, but he can't really take any credit for doing any work on the subject or even covering it competently.

1330
01:30:14,658 --> 01:30:18,974
As we've seen, his Iraq war coverage in 2003 is embarrassing stuff.

1331
01:30:19,072 --> 01:30:34,998
From the insistence that the Bath Party were being reinstalled to rule the country while debacification was taking place, to his unsupported weeks long assertion that Saddam's kids weren't killed and were in Belarus with their father they still are to his really shitty coverage of David Kelly's suicide.

1332
01:30:35,094 --> 01:30:39,990
The larger picture that you get from that time is of a person who's not really worth accepting as a source.

1333
01:30:40,050 --> 01:30:41,162
It's not worth it.

1334
01:30:41,296 --> 01:30:51,830
He wasn't the only person saying that WMD intelligence was sketchy, and the other people who were expressing that opinion didn't overwhelm that accurate opinion with an avalanche of embarrassing bullshit.

1335
01:30:52,510 --> 01:30:56,510
As for Epstein, I really want to challenge this because I don't believe this at all.

1336
01:30:56,620 --> 01:31:03,626
I've listened to Alex from a lot of periods of his career and I've never heard him bring up Epstein except after larger media covered the story.

1337
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:09,950
I don't believe at all that Alex was covering Epstein, let alone covering him by name ten years before the mainstream.

1338
01:31:10,930 --> 01:31:13,986
I believe that Alex has convinced himself of his own bullshit.

1339
01:31:14,058 --> 01:31:21,482
Like we talked about earlier, from as far back as I can find, alex basically believes the Satanic panic type stuff was real.

1340
01:31:21,616 --> 01:31:29,786
Things like the McMarton school case were actually real, and he based a lot of that off that insane shit that Ted Gunderson apparently had told him.

1341
01:31:29,908 --> 01:31:40,886
I do accept that Alex has talked about his fantasies of satanic groups kidnapping and abusing children for a long time, and I think what he's done is retroactively connect Epstein to that coverage so he can claim he was on the.

1342
01:31:40,888 --> 01:31:44,598
Story all along, like how his first documentary was about the great recess.

1343
01:31:44,694 --> 01:31:45,134
Right.

1344
01:31:45,232 --> 01:31:53,054
I'm open to anyone providing me with evidence that Alex was talking about Epstein by name, about his island and the sex crimes ten years before everyone else.

1345
01:31:53,092 --> 01:31:56,018
And if they do, I will reevaluate my position.

1346
01:31:56,164 --> 01:32:00,950
But I've looked, and I can find no evidence that this claim that Alex is making is true at all.

1347
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:09,626
I've even looked through the Alex Jones predictions section on his website where he posts all the videos of him ostensibly being right about all these things way back in the past.

1348
01:32:09,748 --> 01:32:13,374
I can't find any video of him being way ahead of the curve on Epstein.

1349
01:32:13,542 --> 01:32:17,550
And thus, this answer Alex is giving feels accurate.

1350
01:32:17,670 --> 01:32:26,798
He's asked to say what he's most proud of in his career, and what he comes up with is one story that half the country got right and the other is something that is almost certainly not true.

1351
01:32:26,944 --> 01:32:29,354
There's nothing in his career to be proud of.

1352
01:32:29,452 --> 01:32:35,210
He spouted meaningless bullshit for two decades, and I'll definitely applaud him for dragging it out that long.

1353
01:32:35,260 --> 01:32:40,574
But beyond that, his career has meant nothing but other people's pain and in profiting from it.

1354
01:32:40,672 --> 01:32:45,002
Yeah, if that was me, I would have said nothing.

1355
01:32:45,076 --> 01:32:48,160
I would've been like, you know what? I don't really want to answer this question.

1356
01:32:48,910 --> 01:32:53,538
We've launched so many media stars, like Reset Wars.

1357
01:32:53,694 --> 01:32:55,420
Oh, no, that's not good.

1358
01:32:56,110 --> 01:32:59,906
What else do we got? I've made a lot of money.

1359
01:33:00,088 --> 01:33:02,654
Jakari Jackson published a children's book.

1360
01:33:02,692 --> 01:33:03,866
I think that was pretty cool.

1361
01:33:03,928 --> 01:33:05,946
That was after evil wars.

1362
01:33:06,078 --> 01:33:08,094
Anyway, cross examination starts.

1363
01:33:08,142 --> 01:33:09,578
Oh, boy, this is fun.

1364
01:33:09,724 --> 01:33:12,170
Fireworks happens a little bit down the road.

1365
01:33:12,220 --> 01:33:12,434
Yeah.

1366
01:33:12,472 --> 01:33:18,570
But first, Mark's initial strategy in the beginning of this is to impeach Alex as a credible witness.

1367
01:33:18,690 --> 01:33:21,170
And so to do that, he sets a couple of traps.

1368
01:33:21,490 --> 01:33:30,114
Before I talk to you about the details of the history of this case, I want to know you're taking this job seriously.

1369
01:33:30,162 --> 01:33:33,206
You're approaching it in good faith? Absolutely.

1370
01:33:33,388 --> 01:33:34,120
Okay.

1371
01:33:34,510 --> 01:33:52,002
The truth is, you and your company wants the world to believe that this judge is reading this court proceeding to make sure that a script, a literal script, is being followed.

1372
01:33:52,086 --> 01:33:59,694
That's what you want the world to believe, right? Aren't I barred from talking about this? I'm asking you a question, Mr.

1373
01:33:59,732 --> 01:34:00,166
Jones.

1374
01:34:00,238 --> 01:34:06,354
The way court works as you answer a question until there's an objection, again, Mr.

1375
01:34:06,392 --> 01:34:08,430
Jones, make sure you understand it very clearly.

1376
01:34:09,170 --> 01:34:22,690
You and your company want the world to believe that this judge is rigging this court proceeding so that a script, and I mean a literal script, is being followed.

1377
01:34:22,750 --> 01:34:24,560
That's what you want the world to live.

1378
01:34:25,010 --> 01:34:26,106
That's what Info was.

1379
01:34:26,168 --> 01:34:29,842
I believe when you're given a court order that you cannot say you're innocent, that that's not America.

1380
01:34:29,866 --> 01:34:31,530
And the court orders right at their own table.

1381
01:34:32,030 --> 01:34:33,874
I've been told I can't say I'm innocent.

1382
01:34:33,982 --> 01:34:37,674
So you need to answer the question that is asked.

1383
01:34:37,772 --> 01:34:38,970
I asked you this question.

1384
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:47,146
Yes or no? That's what you want the world to believe? No, I believe the jury's real, and I believe that I'm innocent till proven guilty.

1385
01:34:47,158 --> 01:34:49,366
And I believe the jury should decide my guilt.

1386
01:34:49,498 --> 01:34:55,880
Your Honor, at this time we'd like to offer a clip from Infowars on Friday for the purposes of peacement in which those exact words were said.

1387
01:34:57,170 --> 01:35:03,106
So that happens, and then it immediately leads into another trap.

1388
01:35:03,298 --> 01:35:25,734
One of the things you've been talking about a lot recently on your show, even within the past couple of months, is your allegation that government officials are aiding in pedophilia, child trafficking, and the grooming of children, right? Well, you mean like what Jeffrey Epstein did with the Clintons? Sure, if that's a yes.

1389
01:35:25,772 --> 01:35:26,994
Is that a yes? Yes.

1390
01:35:27,092 --> 01:35:27,740
Okay.

1391
01:35:28,070 --> 01:35:35,874
And on Thursday, you and Infowars started connecting those allegations to our judge, didn't you? No.

1392
01:35:36,032 --> 01:35:37,290
In fact, Mr.

1393
01:35:37,340 --> 01:35:55,722
Jones, you're telling the world not to believe what happens in this courtroom because the judge worked with Child Protective Services, who you say is involved with pedophilia and child trafficking, correct? Not all of it, but the Texas Youth Commission got caught doing it.

1394
01:35:55,796 --> 01:35:56,730
There's a lot of that here.

1395
01:35:56,780 --> 01:35:57,990
I'm not asking you that, Mr.

1396
01:35:58,040 --> 01:35:58,402
Johnson.

1397
01:35:58,426 --> 01:36:12,966
I'm asking you you're telling the world not to believe what's happened in this trial because this judge is involved with CPS who is working with child traffickers in Mediterranean, correct? No, that's not what I'm saying.

1398
01:36:13,028 --> 01:36:13,362
Okay.

1399
01:36:13,436 --> 01:36:15,630
Your Honor, at this time, we would like to show a clip for Mr.

1400
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:22,822
Duncan on Thursday where those words are said and there's, of course, a third rate.

1401
01:36:22,896 --> 01:36:26,890
Why wouldn't they tell the jury? You're taking the show seriously.

1402
01:36:27,990 --> 01:36:54,580
You're telling the world that someone inside Travis County government rigged the jury summits and picked these jurors specifically who don't know what planet they are on, correct? That's what you're telling the world I'm saying that could potentially be a danger if they don't know what's going on.

1403
01:36:55,270 --> 01:36:57,160
Potentially is what you're saying.

1404
01:36:57,550 --> 01:37:01,600
Potentially? You didn't go on your phone and say those words is what you're going to tell me.

1405
01:37:02,050 --> 01:37:05,286
Can you show me? I would be happy to forgive.

1406
01:37:05,478 --> 01:37:07,602
We would like to now offer a video for Mrs.

1407
01:37:07,626 --> 01:37:09,820
Jones show on Friday saying those words.

1408
01:37:10,570 --> 01:37:18,374
This reminds me so much of the deposition where it's like, okay, we're on.

1409
01:37:18,412 --> 01:37:19,406
Try number three.

1410
01:37:19,468 --> 01:37:32,918
How do you not realize that when he says, did you say those words, he's going to play the clip? Right, but answering yes is a chaotic option.

1411
01:37:33,004 --> 01:37:33,842
That is true.

1412
01:37:33,916 --> 01:37:34,550
That is true.

1413
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:38,440
But you have to answer yes.

1414
01:37:38,830 --> 01:37:46,650
It's a show like you have to answer with and then something you can't say no because he's just going to go, yeah, that is let's go to the clip.

1415
01:37:46,710 --> 01:37:47,426
That is an option.

1416
01:37:47,488 --> 01:37:54,700
Yeah, but no matter what, what you end up with is like, okay, we've demonstrated that Alex is an untrustworthy person.

1417
01:37:55,630 --> 01:37:56,958
This is all bullshit.

1418
01:37:57,054 --> 01:37:58,986
It's not a witness that you should take seriously.

1419
01:37:59,058 --> 01:38:00,194
Trust, right? No.

1420
01:38:00,232 --> 01:38:01,790
He's got no winning position.

1421
01:38:01,900 --> 01:38:02,654
No, that's true.

1422
01:38:02,692 --> 01:38:03,280
No.

1423
01:38:03,610 --> 01:38:16,094
So Mark tries to bring up the video that Raynall played and the whole thing about how you just repeated all the claims about the school not it being real.

1424
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:21,258
And you realize that if you do that, then you are once again denying Sandy Hook.

1425
01:38:21,354 --> 01:38:21,722
Yeah.

1426
01:38:21,796 --> 01:38:34,434
And I think this is about two minutes and it is a really good encapsulation of why it is useless to try to get Alex to recognize points that he doesn't want to recognize.

1427
01:38:34,482 --> 01:38:35,018
Yes.

1428
01:38:35,164 --> 01:38:42,614
Do you remember them talking about the FBI crime stats saying no one killed in Sandy Hook that you read in that 2017? That was the headlines, yes.

1429
01:38:42,772 --> 01:38:47,900
What headline? But that's what it said.

1430
01:38:49,130 --> 01:38:49,762
No, it didn't.

1431
01:38:49,786 --> 01:38:49,974
Mr.

1432
01:38:50,012 --> 01:38:55,866
John, did you admit that now the FBI did not have a crime status? I mean, I met we later learned that in the full report.

1433
01:38:55,928 --> 01:38:57,366
They don't report those in that state.

1434
01:38:57,428 --> 01:38:58,940
They do, I think, everywhere else.

1435
01:39:00,230 --> 01:39:00,594
Mr.

1436
01:39:00,632 --> 01:39:05,094
Jones, we've heard a lot of testimony about the FBI crime stat and how that got wrong.

1437
01:39:05,132 --> 01:39:05,850
We heard that Mr.

1438
01:39:05,900 --> 01:39:12,730
Salazar, were you in the report room for that? I think I was in different part of it.

1439
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:15,214
Okay, so you probably heard Mr.

1440
01:39:15,252 --> 01:39:20,530
Salazar how he messed that up, right? I think we admit we messed that up.

1441
01:39:20,580 --> 01:39:28,750
Right, but you were still saying it in 2017 at a time where you want this jury to believe you were saying it really happened.

1442
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:32,074
You, in 2017, were saying the FBI says nobody there.

1443
01:39:32,172 --> 01:39:33,190
I said it on the video.

1444
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:34,570
I thought it happened like five times.

1445
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:37,118
Yeah, just like Meghan Kelly said in your interview.

1446
01:39:37,214 --> 01:39:39,370
You want to have all way extension, Mr.

1447
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:40,118
Pennsylvania.

1448
01:39:40,214 --> 01:39:41,578
No, I think Sandy Hook happened.

1449
01:39:41,664 --> 01:39:46,046
Yeah, but if Sandy Hook happened and that means there's not an FBI crime stat where nobody died.

1450
01:39:46,118 --> 01:39:48,194
It means that there was web site traffic.

1451
01:39:48,302 --> 01:39:50,254
It means that nobody ate their food inside the school.

1452
01:39:50,292 --> 01:39:56,494
All these things you're saying are false, right? I'd have to review all of it again.

1453
01:39:56,652 --> 01:40:00,994
Ten minutes ago, we saw a video of you saying no EMTs entered the building.

1454
01:40:01,092 --> 01:40:08,040
Do you remember that? You remember saying that? I never see the timeline of what you're speaking about.

1455
01:40:08,790 --> 01:40:24,710
I'm asking you, when we broke from your break, when your attorney put up a video that he really wanted this jury to see how far you were being about Sandy voter, you said no paramedics interfered, right, at a certain time frame.

1456
01:40:24,890 --> 01:40:28,714
What do you mean by that? I'd have to see the time frame you're talking about.

1457
01:40:28,752 --> 01:40:31,150
What do you mean timeframe? You said they never entered the building.

1458
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:31,954
Never entered it.

1459
01:40:31,992 --> 01:40:34,380
That's what you said, and you said that for years.

1460
01:40:35,850 --> 01:40:44,282
I think you're taking out the contest, right? Because they had to keep them out of the building because otherwise you have to pay off all the MPs because they get in the building and they'd see there's no bodies.

1461
01:40:44,366 --> 01:40:45,794
That's what you told your audience.

1462
01:40:45,902 --> 01:40:47,400
You've told them that many times.

1463
01:40:48,690 --> 01:40:50,662
I don't remember what you're talking about.

1464
01:40:50,856 --> 01:40:55,430
See, this is the next stage of the you have to watch the full clip.

1465
01:40:55,490 --> 01:40:58,382
Never going to win because they watched the full clip.

1466
01:40:58,466 --> 01:41:04,440
And now it had some stuff that Alex probably didn't realize or forgotten was in it, didn't want that.

1467
01:41:04,830 --> 01:41:06,874
Now these are questions that are coming up.

1468
01:41:06,912 --> 01:41:08,486
We have watched the full clip.

1469
01:41:08,618 --> 01:41:09,974
It's out of context.

1470
01:41:10,142 --> 01:41:12,586
I need to see the timeline or whatever.

1471
01:41:12,648 --> 01:41:22,150
There's always going to be an excuse for why there isn't complete information in front of you that is exculpatory in some way for Alex and it's bullshit.

1472
01:41:22,650 --> 01:41:30,182
It's fascinating to me to listen to this and to realize, like, this is also confirmation bias.

1473
01:41:30,326 --> 01:41:38,138
They watched the clip and saw what they wanted to see, and then we're like, well, obviously this is a great clip.

1474
01:41:38,294 --> 01:41:43,790
It didn't even occur to them that the other stuff inside the clip could also be used to question Alex.

1475
01:41:43,850 --> 01:42:00,398
Well, I think maybe they approach it from maybe a perspective that I had when we were going over the Sandy Hook immediate aftermath, and that is that I had a singular focus on trying to figure out, like, the actual literal claim of actors.

1476
01:42:00,494 --> 01:42:00,970
Sure.

1477
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:10,594
And so when I was going over the time frame in 2012 and 2013, there was a like, Alex isn't quite there yet, or whatever.

1478
01:42:10,692 --> 01:42:31,906
Yeah, we did have that conversation and through the case and understanding a little bit more about what was going on and all that, my perspective has changed in terms of like, oh yeah, you said it was a false flag immediately, basically, and had different incarnations of what his theories were and stuff.

1479
01:42:32,028 --> 01:42:49,538
But when I was approaching it with the most generous possible approach and reading of things, I might have heard him say something like, why didn't the paramedics arrive? Or whatever and not be like, okay, this is him denying Hook.

1480
01:42:49,634 --> 01:42:53,762
And I think that probably when looking at the clip, there's, like, he didn't say actors anymore.

1481
01:42:53,786 --> 01:42:54,406
Right.

1482
01:42:54,588 --> 01:43:01,402
And I think that might be just part of how they are oblivious of what is being said to them.

1483
01:43:01,596 --> 01:43:17,350
I also feel like you just brought up a really good point in the way that you view that is, like, when we talk about denying Sandy Hook or Alex denying Sandy Hook, I think a lot of people are talking about him saying this didn't happen.

1484
01:43:17,460 --> 01:43:17,914
Right.

1485
01:43:18,012 --> 01:43:21,758
What it is, is an amorphous blob.

1486
01:43:21,914 --> 01:43:35,930
All of what he has to say is denying that Sandy Hook didn't happen in a sense like, okay, so he's saying, I 100% believe it's real, but I question the official narrative that is just part of the amorphous blob of denying Sandy Hook.

1487
01:43:35,990 --> 01:43:43,810
So when he says that what he's really doing is signaling that he's still denying Sandy Hook on whatever level he can cling to.

1488
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:49,174
So there will not be a resolution where he says it's 100% real.

1489
01:43:49,272 --> 01:43:52,846
If he also says, But I question the official story.

1490
01:43:52,908 --> 01:43:53,170
Right.

1491
01:43:53,220 --> 01:44:01,426
You know what I'm saying? You can't say it's 100% real and then rattle off all of Wolfgang how? Big's reasons why.

1492
01:44:01,608 --> 01:44:02,170
Exactly.

1493
01:44:02,280 --> 01:44:02,662
Yeah.

1494
01:44:02,736 --> 01:44:13,298
And if you're even saying that there are things to question, then you're saying that you were right to question them, and you are saying that there are questions, which there weren't, about Sandy Hook.

1495
01:44:13,334 --> 01:44:18,590
I actually have to take issue with that because I think that, first of all, what Alex was doing wasn't questioning.

1496
01:44:18,650 --> 01:44:20,830
And so you're falling into the framing there.

1497
01:44:20,940 --> 01:44:21,746
Totally.

1498
01:44:21,938 --> 01:44:22,522
Fair enough.

1499
01:44:22,596 --> 01:44:38,114
Because I think that it is okay to question things like, what is a journalist doing other than asking the who, what, where, why, when, how? I meant when he was in court that day when he said, but I questioned the official narrative in court.

1500
01:44:38,162 --> 01:44:43,150
I mean, that outside of that official narrative is okay until you get an answer.

1501
01:44:43,200 --> 01:44:44,470
And he had answers.

1502
01:44:45,030 --> 01:44:46,894
Yes, that is what I'm saying.

1503
01:44:46,992 --> 01:44:48,142
In 2022.

1504
01:44:48,216 --> 01:44:50,854
If he's saying, I had questions.

1505
01:44:50,952 --> 01:44:55,198
If he still says, I have questions about the official narrative in 2022.

1506
01:44:55,344 --> 01:44:55,978
Exactly.

1507
01:44:56,124 --> 01:44:59,138
But I think that was in December.

1508
01:44:59,174 --> 01:44:59,830
That was last year.

1509
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:00,480
Yeah.

1510
01:45:02,670 --> 01:45:04,694
I'm so unspecific.

1511
01:45:04,742 --> 01:45:05,770
That's my problem.

1512
01:45:05,940 --> 01:45:12,902
So, Mark, the big moment in the cross examination, of course, is the revelation of these text messages.

1513
01:45:12,926 --> 01:45:13,570
Beautiful moment.

1514
01:45:13,620 --> 01:45:14,760
We all loved it.

1515
01:45:15,390 --> 01:45:21,758
But I think a lot of the coverage surrounding this is missing the point of these text messages.

1516
01:45:21,854 --> 01:45:25,594
Obviously, there is the juicy idea of what could be in there.

1517
01:45:25,632 --> 01:45:29,470
Of course, I think a lot of people are setting themselves up for real disappointment.

1518
01:45:29,850 --> 01:45:32,630
No, Geraldo found everything in that safe.

1519
01:45:32,690 --> 01:45:40,414
This isn't based on any kind of, like, inside information that I have or anything, so don't take this as me being like, I know X, Y, or Z.

1520
01:45:40,452 --> 01:45:40,906
Sure.

1521
01:45:41,028 --> 01:45:50,998
But I see stories about the notion that Trump's raid was about Alex's text or January 6 is going to be blown wide open.

1522
01:45:51,144 --> 01:46:01,894
And I think that there is a desire to expand things and, like, take the what ifs and give more credence to them.

1523
01:46:01,932 --> 01:46:02,134
Yeah.

1524
01:46:02,172 --> 01:46:05,966
And I think people are falling into that, whether it's through headline writing or tweets.

1525
01:46:06,098 --> 01:46:09,658
And I would advise caution just to like, hey, we'll see what happens.

1526
01:46:09,744 --> 01:46:10,786
We'll see what's there.

1527
01:46:10,848 --> 01:46:11,110
Sure.

1528
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:12,878
But let's not write a story in advance.

1529
01:46:12,974 --> 01:46:13,342
Right.

1530
01:46:13,416 --> 01:46:14,986
I mean, you get that, though.

1531
01:46:15,048 --> 01:46:21,310
You hear we have this how can we not say it? Tranche of text messages.

1532
01:46:21,930 --> 01:46:38,530
And your mind immediately goes to, like, oh, what could be? And you can't not think to yourself, it is entirely possible because we live in the weird world we live in that Alex, Roger Trump and Mike Pompeo might have had a group text where they're like, let's overthrow the country.

1533
01:46:38,580 --> 01:46:39,286
On the 6th.

1534
01:46:39,348 --> 01:46:41,354
Like, you can't not think in your brain.

1535
01:46:41,402 --> 01:46:43,882
Like, that kind of ridiculous thing is possible.

1536
01:46:43,956 --> 01:46:45,686
The world has gone cuckoo.

1537
01:46:45,758 --> 01:46:45,994
Right.

1538
01:46:46,032 --> 01:46:48,730
But then you also have to remember, no, that is not how it works.

1539
01:46:48,780 --> 01:46:50,918
And these are Alex's text messages.

1540
01:46:51,014 --> 01:46:53,686
This is not a big player in the game.

1541
01:46:53,868 --> 01:46:54,600
Yeah.

1542
01:46:55,050 --> 01:47:01,366
There may be pieces of information that are relevant to things, and we'll know when we know.

1543
01:47:01,428 --> 01:47:01,690
Exactly.

1544
01:47:01,740 --> 01:47:13,898
But for now, don't get ahead of yourself, because if you do, you end up backing yourself into a position where you've basically created a storyline.

1545
01:47:13,994 --> 01:47:16,622
And if reality doesn't live up to that, it's disappointing.

1546
01:47:16,706 --> 01:47:17,386
Yeah.

1547
01:47:17,568 --> 01:47:29,926
I think that if we've learned anything in the past couple of attempts at impeachment, we maybe should be a little careful about setting expectations in a reasonable place.

1548
01:47:29,988 --> 01:47:34,450
But the reason why I started with this sure.

1549
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:41,686
I think that the media is absolutely missing the concrete reality of the text messages use in this case.

1550
01:47:41,748 --> 01:47:42,118
Right.

1551
01:47:42,204 --> 01:47:46,066
And why they came up in the cross examination in the way that they did.

1552
01:47:46,188 --> 01:47:52,860
And so Mark begins to get into this, and this is really where the Paul text is most important.

1553
01:47:54,330 --> 01:47:55,234
Were you here for, Mr.

1554
01:47:55,272 --> 01:47:57,574
Short? Yes.

1555
01:47:57,672 --> 01:47:58,042
Okay.

1556
01:47:58,116 --> 01:48:02,978
You remember what Owen said? The company has learned from its mistakes about San Jose.

1557
01:48:03,074 --> 01:48:05,530
You remember that? I didn't hear you say that.

1558
01:48:05,580 --> 01:48:06,600
You agreed that.

1559
01:48:07,110 --> 01:48:09,900
Yeah, we've certainly learned from our mistakes a lot better.

1560
01:48:14,650 --> 01:48:15,014
Mr.

1561
01:48:15,052 --> 01:48:17,330
Jones, I'd like to show you what's been marked as planes.

1562
01:48:21,290 --> 01:48:31,486
You've got it upside down, isn't it? And they mentioned Sandy hooks, don't they? Yes.

1563
01:48:31,608 --> 01:48:33,314
Plants move 130 into evidence.

1564
01:48:33,422 --> 01:48:40,200
So the lead into this question is about Owens testimony that they had learned from Sandy Hook and their behavior had become better.

1565
01:48:40,830 --> 01:48:45,218
And so that's why it's important how this is revealed.

1566
01:48:45,254 --> 01:48:45,742
Right.

1567
01:48:45,876 --> 01:48:46,210
Mr.

1568
01:48:46,260 --> 01:48:52,198
Watson has sent you a screenshot from Infowars.com, correct? Appears to be, yeah.

1569
01:48:52,224 --> 01:48:54,610
And it has an article here, right? Yeah.

1570
01:48:54,720 --> 01:49:02,830
And it says, stays video, shows hospital using Dummies in Er for coronavirus footage.

1571
01:49:06,970 --> 01:49:08,080
I believe so.

1572
01:49:17,970 --> 01:49:19,054
Read along with me, Mr.

1573
01:49:19,092 --> 01:49:19,598
Jones.

1574
01:49:19,694 --> 01:49:22,080
He says this is a video.

1575
01:49:22,890 --> 01:49:23,470
No problem.

1576
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:24,480
Take your time.

1577
01:49:34,010 --> 01:49:35,060
Give me a second.

1578
01:49:36,770 --> 01:49:38,240
All right, go ahead.

1579
01:49:40,430 --> 01:49:40,830
Mr.

1580
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:45,090
Watson says this is a video of a medical student training to intubate.

1581
01:49:45,410 --> 01:49:53,480
Makes us look ridiculous, suggesting this means Covet is fake Sandy Hook all over again.

1582
01:49:54,410 --> 01:49:56,178
I read that correctly, yes.

1583
01:49:56,324 --> 01:49:57,560
Go to the next message.

1584
01:50:07,410 --> 01:50:08,520
I get it.

1585
01:50:10,230 --> 01:50:10,594
Mr.

1586
01:50:10,632 --> 01:50:17,878
Jones, it's true that this article is right now live on Info.com.

1587
01:50:17,904 --> 01:50:18,718
I can pull it up.

1588
01:50:18,804 --> 01:50:21,660
Right? I've never seen this text message.

1589
01:50:22,530 --> 01:50:24,170
I guess you guys got calls.

1590
01:50:24,290 --> 01:50:25,800
My phone didn't save them.

1591
01:50:26,130 --> 01:50:33,910
So that's a sad response because Alex has already said that this is his phone, and these are text between him and Paul.

1592
01:50:34,350 --> 01:50:40,742
And so the notion here is the set up of the question is you learn from Sandy Hook.

1593
01:50:40,766 --> 01:50:42,826
You agree with that? That's what Owen said.

1594
01:50:42,948 --> 01:50:43,630
Yes.

1595
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:57,170
Here's a text during Covet that Paul was telling you, this is Sandy Hook all over again with you doing this bullshit about fake patients in hospitals to pretend that there's covet patients in the hospitals.

1596
01:50:57,290 --> 01:50:59,170
And you said, I get it.

1597
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:02,614
I understand that this is Sandy Hook all over again.

1598
01:51:02,772 --> 01:51:07,802
And the article is still live today as we are in this courtroom.

1599
01:51:07,946 --> 01:51:14,342
This is a damning picture that is basically no, you have not learned from Sandy Hook.

1600
01:51:14,426 --> 01:51:19,822
Not only have you not learned from it, when reminded this is Sandy Hook all over again.

1601
01:51:19,896 --> 01:51:26,040
When you're in the middle of a lawsuit about this sort of behavior as it relates to Sandy Hook, you say, I understand.

1602
01:51:26,370 --> 01:51:28,342
I get it, and I don't care.

1603
01:51:28,416 --> 01:51:28,762
Right.

1604
01:51:28,836 --> 01:51:37,930
And not just that it is not a message from your son or just some stranger email.

1605
01:51:38,040 --> 01:51:44,078
It's a message from your literal head editor for most of your career.

1606
01:51:44,234 --> 01:51:44,698
Yeah.

1607
01:51:44,784 --> 01:51:45,902
You should pay attention.

1608
01:51:45,986 --> 01:51:46,714
Right? Yeah.

1609
01:51:46,752 --> 01:51:59,686
And the person who, like, throughout the course of this case has had maybe the only moment of someone having clarity in his deposition, there's a reason that Paul's not getting right? Absolutely.

1610
01:51:59,808 --> 01:52:03,850
There is documented evidence of him back then saying, cut this out.

1611
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:04,874
This is bullshit.

1612
01:52:04,922 --> 01:52:10,762
No, he's literally the guy who is like he's the person if you had listened to him, you wouldn't be in this situation.

1613
01:52:10,896 --> 01:52:21,814
If we were in a movie that's different from the one that this trial turned into, which was astonishing, but Paul would be the guy who gets roped back in for one last job.

1614
01:52:21,912 --> 01:52:26,038
But in this movie, Paul's like, no, this is a terrible one last job.

1615
01:52:26,124 --> 01:52:27,622
I'm not going to do this one last job.

1616
01:52:27,696 --> 01:52:29,050
You guys go do the one last job.

1617
01:52:29,100 --> 01:52:30,734
And then he's watching them all die.

1618
01:52:30,842 --> 01:52:31,920
That's what's happening.

1619
01:52:33,270 --> 01:52:44,294
He sucks, obviously, but in the lowest of low bars, he has cleared it in terms of he has not stolen $100 million from a bank.

1620
01:52:44,402 --> 01:52:45,386
Congratulations.

1621
01:52:45,518 --> 01:52:49,610
You are not being prosecuted for stealing $100 million from a bank.

1622
01:52:49,670 --> 01:52:56,054
It's wild that you have this situation where Paul is if you listen to him, you wouldn't be getting sued.

1623
01:52:56,102 --> 01:52:57,286
You wouldn't be in the situation.

1624
01:52:57,408 --> 01:52:57,838
Crazy.

1625
01:52:57,924 --> 01:53:10,546
And then you have this text from fairly recently of you should have listened to him, and you should not have had this text exchange because it illustrates how little you give a shit, and that doesn't play well.

1626
01:53:10,608 --> 01:53:13,234
No, I love that.

1627
01:53:13,392 --> 01:53:16,174
Here's the movie, because this is the Perry Mason moment.

1628
01:53:16,212 --> 01:53:17,170
The Perry Mason moment.

1629
01:53:17,220 --> 01:53:26,820
Well, the Perry Mason moment is coming up, right? But Mark dramatically revealing we have all your texts, right? The parody is whenever he goes, you're reading it upside down.

1630
01:53:27,570 --> 01:53:39,094
That's the encapsulation to me of this moment in testimony is that combination of high drama, like, I have revealed fucking Tom Cruise's text messages to you right now.

1631
01:53:39,192 --> 01:53:42,742
And then the fucking hilarity of, like, it's upside down.

1632
01:53:42,816 --> 01:53:43,370
Alex.

1633
01:53:43,490 --> 01:53:49,078
So anyway, Alex tries to spin this, and he's trying really hard to figure out.

1634
01:53:49,104 --> 01:53:52,846
Like, what the fuck can I do here? I've never seen this text message.

1635
01:53:52,908 --> 01:53:53,822
He can choke.

1636
01:53:53,966 --> 01:53:55,574
I guess you guys got Paul's.

1637
01:53:55,682 --> 01:53:57,180
My phone didn't save them.

1638
01:53:57,750 --> 01:53:58,618
That's fine.

1639
01:53:58,704 --> 01:54:00,010
Your phone didn't save the second.

1640
01:54:00,120 --> 01:54:01,020
Here we go.

1641
01:54:01,710 --> 01:54:04,054
I gave it to the lawyers, said they drained the phone.

1642
01:54:04,092 --> 01:54:07,810
They found that stuff, gave it to lawyers.

1643
01:54:08,250 --> 01:54:11,940
They were supposed to find that Tesla is no, I searched as well.

1644
01:54:13,230 --> 01:54:15,840
You guys have all this stuff that you say, we didn't give anything.

1645
01:54:16,290 --> 01:54:20,818
You know how an iPhone works, right? You've had iPhone text messaging for several years now.

1646
01:54:20,964 --> 01:54:21,660
Yeah.

1647
01:54:34,690 --> 01:54:37,094
I turn the phone over, take stuff off.

1648
01:54:37,132 --> 01:54:44,980
Can I have you look in the very bottom below the very bottom left corner? Is that your phone number? Yes.

1649
01:54:47,570 --> 01:54:51,006
So you did get my text messages, and it said, you did.

1650
01:54:51,128 --> 01:54:52,030
Nice trick.

1651
01:54:52,150 --> 01:54:54,906
So this is the beginning of the Perry Mason moment.

1652
01:54:54,968 --> 01:55:03,366
And this is what all of the John Oliver Show and all the clip shows, they run this moment.

1653
01:55:03,428 --> 01:55:07,366
And I understand why, because it is I mean, it's made for TV.

1654
01:55:07,438 --> 01:55:08,842
I mean, it's literally made for TV.

1655
01:55:08,866 --> 01:55:13,902
It's evocative like Bill said in our interview, it's like the biggest legal moment.

1656
01:55:14,036 --> 01:55:14,454
It is.

1657
01:55:14,492 --> 01:55:14,694
Yeah.

1658
01:55:14,732 --> 01:55:18,198
I mean, it doesn't get bigger, does it? And I understand that.

1659
01:55:18,224 --> 01:55:24,918
But because of the way our show works and stuff, I'm so much more interested in the reasoning and the context to it.

1660
01:55:24,944 --> 01:55:32,862
So you have that Paul reveal, and then the reveal of the text messages and the nature of them comes.

1661
01:55:32,996 --> 01:55:34,254
And so that's here.

1662
01:55:34,292 --> 01:55:35,178
Let's all enjoy that.

1663
01:55:35,204 --> 01:55:39,366
Okay, so you did get my text messages and it said you did.

1664
01:55:39,488 --> 01:55:40,530
Nice trick.

1665
01:55:42,470 --> 01:55:43,170
Yes, Mr.

1666
01:55:43,220 --> 01:55:43,882
Johnson.

1667
01:55:44,026 --> 01:55:44,850
Indeed.

1668
01:55:45,830 --> 01:55:47,682
You didn't get the text message to me.

1669
01:55:47,756 --> 01:55:50,840
You don't know where this came from? Do you know where I got this? No.

1670
01:55:52,070 --> 01:55:52,506
Mr.

1671
01:55:52,568 --> 01:56:15,018
Jones, did you know that twelve days ago twelve days ago, your attorneys messed up and sent me an entire digital copy of your entire cell phone with every text message you've sent for the past two years, and when informed, did not take any steps to identify it as privileged or protected in any way.

1672
01:56:15,164 --> 01:56:18,490
And as of two days ago, it fell free and clear into my possession.

1673
01:56:18,610 --> 01:56:23,590
And that is how I know you lied to me when you said you didn't have text message about Samuel.

1674
01:56:23,650 --> 01:56:26,494
Did you know that? I told you the truth.

1675
01:56:26,542 --> 01:56:27,906
This is your Perry Mason moment.

1676
01:56:27,968 --> 01:56:29,960
I gave them my phone.

1677
01:56:30,590 --> 01:56:30,990
Mr.

1678
01:56:31,040 --> 01:56:32,780
Jones, you need to answer the question.

1679
01:56:34,130 --> 01:56:37,520
No, I don't know what happened, but, I mean, I told you I gave him the phone over.

1680
01:56:39,530 --> 01:56:43,650
You said in your deposition you searched your phone.

1681
01:56:43,820 --> 01:56:45,918
You said you pulled down the text.

1682
01:56:46,004 --> 01:56:49,974
Did the search function for Sandy Hook? That's what you said, Mr.

1683
01:56:50,012 --> 01:56:50,362
Jones.

1684
01:56:50,386 --> 01:56:50,960
Correct.

1685
01:56:51,410 --> 01:56:54,714
And I had several different phones with this number, but I did.

1686
01:56:54,752 --> 01:56:57,798
Yeah, I mean, that's why you got it.

1687
01:56:57,944 --> 01:56:58,470
No, Mr.

1688
01:56:58,520 --> 01:57:02,250
Jones, that's not why my lawyer sent it to you.

1689
01:57:02,360 --> 01:57:03,294
But I'm hiding it.

1690
01:57:03,332 --> 01:57:03,894
Okay.

1691
01:57:04,052 --> 01:57:04,482
Mr.

1692
01:57:04,556 --> 01:57:05,338
Jones.

1693
01:57:05,494 --> 01:57:07,026
That's mr.

1694
01:57:07,088 --> 01:57:07,642
Jones.

1695
01:57:07,726 --> 01:57:08,454
Oh, I love it.

1696
01:57:08,492 --> 01:57:17,482
Yeah, I mean, like, all of these attempts to wiggle out of this, I just feel like have backfired for him and made it worse.

1697
01:57:17,566 --> 01:57:30,466
Do you know what the craziest thing, the craziest moment? Because whenever I went back through all of the stuff that I've written, there were so many moments that you do just lose because it's absolute, nonstop insanity.

1698
01:57:30,598 --> 01:57:40,518
But the craziest one was on Tuesday or day one of the trial proper, the day after jury selection, the opening statement day.

1699
01:57:40,544 --> 01:57:40,914
Yeah.

1700
01:57:41,012 --> 01:57:50,490
In the middle of one of the breaks, alex is talking to the HBO documentarian on stream, and at one point, he does say, they don't have my texts.

1701
01:57:51,590 --> 01:57:58,282
How crazy is that? How fucking wild is that? That was the wildest thing, like, going back to irony.

1702
01:57:58,366 --> 01:57:59,886
I was like, that can't be real.

1703
01:57:59,948 --> 01:58:02,406
And I checked, and it's crazy.

1704
01:58:02,528 --> 01:58:07,182
Well, again, we have to make the point that could have been talking about other text.

1705
01:58:07,256 --> 01:58:07,880
No.

1706
01:58:08,450 --> 01:58:10,810
Your tweets may or may not depict reality.

1707
01:58:10,870 --> 01:58:12,366
They absolutely do not.

1708
01:58:12,488 --> 01:58:16,100
Yeah, who knows if that conversation even happened or you imagined it.

1709
01:58:16,910 --> 01:58:17,670
Fair enough.

1710
01:58:17,780 --> 01:58:23,406
So Alex has now said that he searched his phones, of course, and didn't find these things.

1711
01:58:23,468 --> 01:58:23,766
Right.

1712
01:58:23,828 --> 01:58:29,494
And so Mark has to inform him that, hey, buddy, you may have just committed perjury.

1713
01:58:29,602 --> 01:58:30,270
That's not good.

1714
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:30,570
Mr.

1715
01:58:30,620 --> 01:58:37,854
Jones, in discovery, you were asked, do you have Sandy Hook text messages on your phone? And you said no.

1716
01:58:37,952 --> 01:58:38,600
Correct.

1717
01:58:42,630 --> 01:58:46,922
You said that under oath, if I was mistaken.

1718
01:58:46,946 --> 01:58:48,778
But you got the messages right there.

1719
01:58:48,864 --> 01:58:52,718
You know, I just want to make sure, you know, before we go any further.

1720
01:58:52,754 --> 01:58:53,760
You know what it is.

1721
01:58:54,330 --> 01:58:55,270
Yes, I do.

1722
01:58:55,380 --> 01:58:56,350
I'm not a tech guy.

1723
01:58:56,400 --> 01:59:01,198
I told you, I gave in my testimony the phone to the lawyers before, whatever.

1724
01:59:01,284 --> 01:59:03,694
And so you got my phone, but we didn't give it to you.

1725
01:59:03,732 --> 01:59:03,898
No.

1726
01:59:03,924 --> 01:59:04,114
Mr.

1727
01:59:04,152 --> 01:59:10,834
Jones, one more time, please remember, if you need to assert them in, you can I need to know that you can do that.

1728
01:59:10,992 --> 01:59:22,322
When you testified under oath previously that you personally searched your phone for the phrase Sandy boat and there were no messages, you said that under oath.

1729
01:59:22,406 --> 01:59:23,040
Yes.

1730
01:59:24,090 --> 01:59:25,510
No, I did not lie.

1731
01:59:27,270 --> 01:59:28,030
Ouch.

1732
01:59:28,770 --> 01:59:41,462
When you say something that is then later found out to be not true, and you knew that it was not true, right? Because it was you who said you did it and you didn't.

1733
01:59:41,606 --> 01:59:43,860
What is that called? Not good.

1734
01:59:44,190 --> 01:59:44,806
Yeah.

1735
01:59:44,928 --> 01:59:47,650
And it turns out also applies to his emails.

1736
01:59:49,170 --> 01:59:54,002
I quit opening email and using it for sanity.

1737
01:59:54,026 --> 01:59:54,358
Go.

1738
01:59:54,444 --> 01:59:55,080
Okay.

1739
01:59:55,530 --> 01:59:58,834
In other words, if somebody was to tell me, oh, I have emails from Mr.

1740
01:59:58,872 --> 02:00:03,326
Jones that he wrote about this case in the past couple of years, that person be lying.

1741
02:00:03,398 --> 02:00:04,570
You're telling the truth.

1742
02:00:05,130 --> 02:00:10,190
Somebody else has got my Info works email because I haven't been using it's not qualified.

1743
02:00:10,250 --> 02:00:10,474
Mr.

1744
02:00:10,512 --> 02:00:16,382
James, you know, in this case you were asked to produce your emails, any emails you had about San Jose.

1745
02:00:16,406 --> 02:00:18,850
You knew you were asked to do that, right? Yeah.

1746
02:00:18,900 --> 02:00:20,482
And you said he didn't have it.

1747
02:00:20,676 --> 02:00:21,706
I told my It.

1748
02:00:21,768 --> 02:00:23,950
People go, you got all that stuff now, mr.

1749
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:33,094
Johnson, I'm saying in deposition, under oath, sworn to God, you said you don't have any emails for saying hook because you don't use email.

1750
02:00:33,192 --> 02:00:42,710
Right? I have been using Infowars email and it's got to be a decade or longer in my memory.

1751
02:00:43,930 --> 02:00:55,782
We're with infowars.com email, he keeps trying to bring it back to Infowars email as opposed to another email thing.

1752
02:00:55,856 --> 02:01:02,540
And what Mark is doing is very clearly trying to establish like, you lied again because I have an email.

1753
02:01:05,130 --> 02:01:12,898
But the attempt to wiggle out of it is just the constantly bringing up Infowars emails and it's just not going to help.

1754
02:01:12,984 --> 02:01:24,310
Earlier in the trial, Raynall had been talking to Daria as the corporate representative that he objected to and then talked to her as the corporate representative.

1755
02:01:24,750 --> 02:01:27,778
He had said like, Alex doesn't have an email address, right.

1756
02:01:27,804 --> 02:01:32,542
And she's like, oh, when he did, he'd get 100 million emails a day.

1757
02:01:32,676 --> 02:01:38,602
So he got rid of it as though that would be later the excuse for what now happens.

1758
02:01:38,796 --> 02:01:39,442
Yeah.

1759
02:01:39,576 --> 02:01:40,810
How did it go? Not well.

1760
02:01:40,860 --> 02:01:42,082
Not the best.

1761
02:01:42,276 --> 02:01:44,378
So we go back to the text messages.

1762
02:01:44,414 --> 02:01:53,280
Now, we have already illustrated that Paul had texted with Alex and told him, this is Sandy Hook all over again.

1763
02:01:53,910 --> 02:01:56,738
I get it is the response.

1764
02:01:56,894 --> 02:02:02,786
And now there's some other texts here from Tim Fruge, who's the business manager of Infowars.

1765
02:02:02,858 --> 02:02:04,560
And so here's how this goes.

1766
02:02:05,010 --> 02:02:07,834
This has been marked as planned, exhibit 132.

1767
02:02:07,932 --> 02:02:11,086
Do you see that? Yes.

1768
02:02:11,148 --> 02:02:16,234
Those are text messages of Tim Fruge, the operations manager of Infowars, right? Yes.

1769
02:02:16,332 --> 02:02:20,050
And we requested information about your revenues in this case, you remember that? Yes.

1770
02:02:20,100 --> 02:02:23,818
You didn't give us this, did you? There's a lot of stuff yeah.

1771
02:02:23,844 --> 02:02:25,150
You didn't even look through your text message.

1772
02:02:25,200 --> 02:02:29,314
And this is going to hit them, right? Correct? No.

1773
02:02:29,412 --> 02:02:29,782
Okay.

1774
02:02:29,856 --> 02:02:30,974
I gave it to the lawyers.

1775
02:02:31,022 --> 02:02:32,280
That's why you have it.

1776
02:02:33,150 --> 02:02:34,510
This is ridiculous.

1777
02:02:38,710 --> 02:02:39,074
Yes.

1778
02:02:51,590 --> 02:02:53,122
132 is submitted.

1779
02:02:53,206 --> 02:02:54,354
Before we put that up, Mr.

1780
02:02:54,392 --> 02:02:57,538
Jones, I just want to make sure you understand something about these emails.

1781
02:02:57,694 --> 02:03:04,054
You understand that when your attorney sent me your hold on, he didn't mean to do that injection.

1782
02:03:04,102 --> 02:03:06,810
Your honor, I just want to make sure this is not discovery.

1783
02:03:07,250 --> 02:03:25,210
Well, I do think it's important that since we're discussing all of this, that the jury understands discovery is a process that occurs and concludes well before trial what the lawyers say is of evidence.

1784
02:03:25,710 --> 02:03:28,658
So we don't.

1785
02:03:28,694 --> 02:03:31,090
Know whether it was on accident or on purpose.

1786
02:03:31,950 --> 02:03:41,220
Yeah, we don't have evidence about that, but what we do know is that it wasn't properly turned over when it should have been.

1787
02:03:42,810 --> 02:03:43,702
There's no question.

1788
02:03:43,776 --> 02:03:44,050
Mr.

1789
02:03:44,100 --> 02:03:44,870
Downstairs.

1790
02:03:44,990 --> 02:03:49,102
Okay, so there is a fair objection there.

1791
02:03:49,176 --> 02:03:49,450
Yes.

1792
02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:52,454
Because you're asserting that he did this accidentally.

1793
02:03:52,502 --> 02:03:52,858
True.

1794
02:03:52,944 --> 02:03:53,794
You can't prove that.

1795
02:03:53,832 --> 02:03:54,502
Can't do that.

1796
02:03:54,576 --> 02:03:55,702
Well, I mean, kind of.

1797
02:03:55,776 --> 02:04:07,654
But what you have is text about finances that are like, here's the numbers for this day, and then Alex just didn't turn those over.

1798
02:04:07,752 --> 02:04:08,400
Right.

1799
02:04:08,850 --> 02:04:09,694
That's real bad.

1800
02:04:09,732 --> 02:04:24,862
It does appear that I do think there's an argument to be made that you can say that he didn't mean to do it because the Reynold did email back, like, please disregard, which isn't legally it doesn't mean anything.

1801
02:04:24,936 --> 02:04:26,410
But Mark hasn't introduced that.

1802
02:04:26,460 --> 02:04:26,950
That's true.

1803
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,640
Sorry, he can't do that now.

1804
02:04:30,150 --> 02:04:30,900
Right.

1805
02:04:32,070 --> 02:04:34,490
Then Reynald would object to privilege.

1806
02:04:34,550 --> 02:04:35,410
Yeah, it would be a mess.

1807
02:04:35,460 --> 02:04:38,078
The court is unaware of that email response.

1808
02:04:38,114 --> 02:04:38,700
Right.

1809
02:04:39,090 --> 02:04:48,850
So one of the things that's critical about the revelation of these texts is that they illustrate financial information that was demanded and ordered from Alex right.

1810
02:04:48,900 --> 02:04:52,550
That was not turned over, but more for my purposes.

1811
02:04:52,730 --> 02:04:56,330
They also reveal that Alex is full of shit.

1812
02:04:56,510 --> 02:04:56,890
Mr.

1813
02:04:56,940 --> 02:04:57,850
Fruge.

1814
02:04:58,230 --> 02:04:59,170
Fruge.

1815
02:04:59,490 --> 02:05:00,634
How do I say his name? Mr.

1816
02:05:00,672 --> 02:05:01,298
Jones.

1817
02:05:01,454 --> 02:05:02,206
All right, so Mr.

1818
02:05:02,268 --> 02:05:11,386
Fruge, you would agree with me that pretty much every day he sends you an update on how much the store has sold and sometimes he lets you know how much profit you make.

1819
02:05:11,448 --> 02:05:12,298
Right? Yes.

1820
02:05:12,384 --> 02:05:12,742
Okay.

1821
02:05:12,816 --> 02:05:23,354
And in this message, he says 110 gross sales in food equates to almost 70K pure profit.

1822
02:05:23,462 --> 02:05:27,682
That's what he told you? That's what that says.

1823
02:05:27,816 --> 02:05:29,340
That's not what it does.

1824
02:05:35,950 --> 02:05:39,160
So, look, this makes total sense.

1825
02:05:39,910 --> 02:05:48,326
Alex has said that there's a 20% to 40% profit margin on the food, and you just let that go and you're like, oh, yeah, okay, I guess that makes sense.

1826
02:05:48,508 --> 02:05:50,906
He's not paying anything for the food.

1827
02:05:51,028 --> 02:05:55,766
It's not like he buys it from My Patriot Supply and then sends it to people.

1828
02:05:55,828 --> 02:05:56,922
Yeah, he's not a resale.

1829
02:05:57,006 --> 02:06:01,850
No, he's essentially getting a cut of what the business that they do.

1830
02:06:01,960 --> 02:06:03,642
There is no overhead.

1831
02:06:03,726 --> 02:06:04,010
No.

1832
02:06:04,060 --> 02:06:05,750
It is all pure profit.

1833
02:06:06,430 --> 02:06:14,142
So that also illustrates that the thing that Alex testified to earlier, which is that the 20% to 40% profit margin is a load of shit.

1834
02:06:14,226 --> 02:06:14,726
Yeah.

1835
02:06:14,848 --> 02:06:15,458
100%.

1836
02:06:15,484 --> 02:06:19,300
It has no risk, no exposure on the food.

1837
02:06:19,810 --> 02:06:22,410
Maybe things are different with the private labeling.

1838
02:06:22,530 --> 02:06:24,242
Maybe with his supplements and stuff.

1839
02:06:24,316 --> 02:06:24,554
Sure.

1840
02:06:24,592 --> 02:06:26,598
He has to buy a bunch and then resell.

1841
02:06:26,634 --> 02:06:30,818
It possible, but yeah, for the food, that's not the case at all.

1842
02:06:30,904 --> 02:06:36,450
I mean, they even did, like, drop shipping from the My Patriot supply facilities.

1843
02:06:36,570 --> 02:06:37,360
Got you.

1844
02:06:38,830 --> 02:06:43,026
So only 110 units is 70,000 in pure profit.

1845
02:06:43,098 --> 02:06:43,370
Right.

1846
02:06:43,420 --> 02:06:44,150
I think that's crazy.

1847
02:06:44,200 --> 02:06:48,486
I think that probably is an unreliable statistic to, like, universalize.

1848
02:06:48,618 --> 02:06:49,578
Oh, no, I wouldn't.

1849
02:06:49,674 --> 02:06:54,686
They have different sized buckets and things that they sell.

1850
02:06:54,808 --> 02:07:02,930
So it's not a uniform commission, I'm sure, but yeah, even percentage of the total.

1851
02:07:03,040 --> 02:07:04,806
That still is pretty sweet.

1852
02:07:04,878 --> 02:07:05,790
Not a bad gig.

1853
02:07:05,850 --> 02:07:06,642
Pretty sweet.

1854
02:07:06,726 --> 02:07:09,590
All you have to do is say stuff and then they give you money.

1855
02:07:09,760 --> 02:07:13,010
All you have to do is convince everyone that they won't get food tomorrow.

1856
02:07:13,810 --> 02:07:15,460
You're going to die anyway.

1857
02:07:16,930 --> 02:07:19,190
So here is Mark's Dismount.

1858
02:07:19,510 --> 02:07:25,010
And then I think we saw your revenues from 20.

1859
02:07:25,180 --> 02:07:27,918
So we saw a few months of 2015 on the beginning of that document.

1860
02:07:27,954 --> 02:07:28,540
Right.

1861
02:07:29,230 --> 02:07:35,414
Do you remember that document you relied on and testified about planning to exist? I saw it, yes.

1862
02:07:35,512 --> 02:07:35,918
Okay.

1863
02:07:36,004 --> 02:07:38,126
I had a couple of months from 2015 on it.

1864
02:07:38,128 --> 02:07:42,410
But not a whole lot of sales on that, right? I believe so.

1865
02:07:42,460 --> 02:07:44,682
Okay, so we're mainly just talking about 20 16.

1866
02:07:44,766 --> 02:07:46,310
20 18, right.

1867
02:07:46,360 --> 02:07:50,474
You remember that? 165,000,000.

1868
02:07:50,632 --> 02:07:52,238
You remember testifying? Yes.

1869
02:07:52,384 --> 02:07:52,910
Okay.

1870
02:07:53,020 --> 02:07:56,594
And I know you testified about your profit margins, but I think we've seen that now.

1871
02:07:56,692 --> 02:08:05,420
You were saying that that's gross, so that maybe doesn't we have to calculate what your profit is, right? I need a yes or no.

1872
02:08:25,270 --> 02:08:35,260
this is what you should pay for the damages that your company admits under oath through your corporate representative costs? Were you aware of that? One dollars.

1873
02:08:35,950 --> 02:08:37,214
Were you aware? Yes.

1874
02:08:37,252 --> 02:08:40,418
Not that we were do you agree? Do.

1875
02:08:40,444 --> 02:08:41,150
I agree with it.

1876
02:08:41,200 --> 02:08:41,980
One dollars.

1877
02:08:45,050 --> 02:08:46,038
I'll pay it for you.

1878
02:08:46,064 --> 02:08:52,746
Are we done? What does the New York Times do for why? About WMDs? I don't think there's any point in asking you any more questions.

1879
02:08:52,928 --> 02:08:53,660
Okay.

1880
02:08:54,230 --> 02:08:55,342
Slamming the door.

1881
02:08:55,426 --> 02:08:55,962
Yes.

1882
02:08:56,096 --> 02:08:59,238
I don't think there's any reason to ask you any more questions.

1883
02:08:59,324 --> 02:09:03,620
What a great way to just call it so good.

1884
02:09:06,510 --> 02:09:10,810
Again, a little theatrical in as much as you pull out a dollar and be like, this is it.

1885
02:09:10,920 --> 02:09:14,086
Is this what we're doing? Come on, give the man his moment.

1886
02:09:14,208 --> 02:09:20,170
No, I'm fine with it in this context, but yes, Alex can't answer that question.

1887
02:09:20,220 --> 02:09:21,370
Absolutely not.

1888
02:09:21,540 --> 02:09:24,998
And then Rayna all one question on redirect.

1889
02:09:25,094 --> 02:09:26,834
Yeah, very funny.

1890
02:09:26,882 --> 02:09:28,090
Is so funny.

1891
02:09:31,690 --> 02:09:36,510
You've trusted your lawyers to produce the relevant documents.

1892
02:09:36,690 --> 02:09:37,358
Yes.

1893
02:09:37,504 --> 02:09:39,962
You've cooperated with us in every way.

1894
02:09:40,096 --> 02:09:40,574
Yes.

1895
02:09:40,672 --> 02:09:44,294
And you trusted us to do a good job and turn over what we need to turn over.

1896
02:09:44,392 --> 02:09:44,798
Yes.

1897
02:09:44,884 --> 02:09:46,274
When we're supposed to turn it over.

1898
02:09:46,372 --> 02:09:47,020
Yes.

1899
02:09:52,670 --> 02:09:53,814
No further questions.

1900
02:09:53,972 --> 02:09:54,546
Yes.

1901
02:09:54,668 --> 02:09:56,240
And this is the end.

1902
02:09:56,870 --> 02:10:02,202
That is one situation where Alex did not realize that his lawyer was no longer working for him.

1903
02:10:02,336 --> 02:10:04,702
His lawyer was working for Reynald.

1904
02:10:04,846 --> 02:10:05,514
Yeah.

1905
02:10:05,672 --> 02:10:06,558
Cover your ass.

1906
02:10:06,644 --> 02:10:07,182
Yeah.

1907
02:10:07,316 --> 02:10:10,782
Maybe Alex should have said no to all of those questions.

1908
02:10:10,976 --> 02:10:11,442
Yeah.

1909
02:10:11,516 --> 02:10:17,406
So this testimony took place over the course of Tuesday and Wednesday? Yeah.

1910
02:10:17,468 --> 02:10:19,650
Tuesday afternoon, Wednesday morning.

1911
02:10:19,820 --> 02:10:31,062
And there's closing statements and then we get the revelation on Thursday that Alex is hit with the compensatory damages of 4.1 million.

1912
02:10:31,256 --> 02:10:36,260
And as this news breaks, it is past the point that Alex is on air.

1913
02:10:36,650 --> 02:10:44,770
And so Owen is hosting the War Room at this point, complaining about, I don't know, the Chinese.

1914
02:10:44,890 --> 02:10:46,700
Sure, probably that sounds right.

1915
02:10:47,090 --> 02:10:49,926
And so here's him discussing that.

1916
02:10:49,988 --> 02:10:51,560
The judgment has come in.

1917
02:10:51,950 --> 02:11:00,560
A lot of people are tuned in right now because the news is broke about the first verdict in the Sandy Hook case.

1918
02:11:01,010 --> 02:11:03,610
And they got a $4 million judgment.

1919
02:11:03,790 --> 02:11:05,098
Never had a trial by jury.

1920
02:11:05,134 --> 02:11:07,230
Judge just decided guilt.

1921
02:11:08,150 --> 02:11:19,220
And now they got a $4 million verdict, which is they were shooting for 150,000,000 because they got to line their pockets, I guess.

1922
02:11:20,210 --> 02:11:23,300
Whoever is getting that money, I don't know where that money goes.

1923
02:11:24,170 --> 02:11:33,066
That would absolve any emotional distress, but okay, so there might be a statement from Alex Jones soon.

1924
02:11:33,248 --> 02:11:34,374
He might go live.

1925
02:11:34,472 --> 02:11:35,430
He might pop in.

1926
02:11:35,480 --> 02:11:36,380
I don't know.

1927
02:11:37,310 --> 02:11:39,658
We're on a Titanic right now playing the violin.

1928
02:11:39,694 --> 02:11:41,670
Okay, well, that's good news.

1929
02:11:41,720 --> 02:11:42,870
I've got all the news to cover.

1930
02:11:42,920 --> 02:11:46,446
And that's what's so sad about it, is nobody else is going to cover this news.

1931
02:11:46,568 --> 02:11:48,078
It's only info where it's going to cover it.

1932
02:11:48,104 --> 02:11:50,060
And now we won't even be able to cover it.

1933
02:11:51,530 --> 02:11:53,854
So just stay tuned.

1934
02:11:53,902 --> 02:11:56,074
There will be a statement from Alex shortly.

1935
02:11:56,182 --> 02:11:56,994
Can't cover the news.

1936
02:11:57,032 --> 02:11:58,210
Too busy playing violence.

1937
02:11:58,270 --> 02:12:04,134
That is such a funny Whiny way of, oh, look, now I can't even cover the news.

1938
02:12:04,232 --> 02:12:08,298
See, now who's the victim? Look what the Sandy Hook parents have done.

1939
02:12:08,324 --> 02:12:09,678
They may be unable to cover the news.

1940
02:12:09,704 --> 02:12:18,102
Is that what he's saying? In his many words, look at what these people have done to me.

1941
02:12:18,176 --> 02:12:20,598
And who knows where that money is going? What an hour.

1942
02:12:20,624 --> 02:12:25,170
Really trying to make suspicious the idea of a lawsuit.

1943
02:12:25,790 --> 02:12:27,426
And so he's right.

1944
02:12:27,608 --> 02:12:29,190
Alex does pop in later.

1945
02:12:29,300 --> 02:12:31,062
So that's one thing Owens right about.

1946
02:12:31,196 --> 02:12:34,126
He's second winning in the talk show predictions.

1947
02:12:34,318 --> 02:12:39,714
Second thing he's right about, alex was filming a statement before he came on.

1948
02:12:39,812 --> 02:12:43,842
And so here is that we're going to go to that right away.

1949
02:12:43,976 --> 02:12:51,646
The Democratic Party, the entire corporate media lined up against Infowars and the American people's free speech.

1950
02:12:51,778 --> 02:13:04,650
The judge, more than 20 times in the last week and a half in Austin, Texas, told the jury while I was there in the courtroom and it was on national TV that Alex Jones is guilty.

1951
02:13:06,350 --> 02:13:14,060
The lawyers for the plaintiffs asked for between 150,000,000 and $3 billion.

1952
02:13:14,390 --> 02:13:22,350
When the jury came in this evening with $4.2 million, I admitted I was wrong.

1953
02:13:22,460 --> 02:13:23,890
I admitted I made a mistake.

1954
02:13:24,010 --> 02:13:27,658
I admitted that I followed this information, but not on purpose.

1955
02:13:27,754 --> 02:13:35,286
I apologize to families, and the jury understood that what I did to those families was wrong.

1956
02:13:35,408 --> 02:13:37,378
But I didn't do it on purpose.

1957
02:13:37,534 --> 02:13:40,198
I didn't lie about WMDs in Iraq.

1958
02:13:40,234 --> 02:13:52,950
My God, is the people on purpose? I questioned the public event because I saw anomalies and others saw anomalies, and the jury understood that and awarded $4.2 million.

1959
02:13:53,000 --> 02:14:00,186
Now, that's more money than my company and I personally have, but we are going to work on trying to make restitution there.

1960
02:14:00,248 --> 02:14:01,242
Oh, what a great guy.

1961
02:14:01,316 --> 02:14:01,662
Wow.

1962
02:14:01,736 --> 02:14:06,730
So I think the 3 billion number is meant to make the judgment look even smaller.

1963
02:14:06,790 --> 02:14:07,050
Sure.

1964
02:14:07,100 --> 02:14:18,222
I was trying to figure out where that came from, and I think it's the sales figures that Mark showed from the text messages that Fruge was sending over okay.

1965
02:14:18,296 --> 02:14:23,286
During CPAC, it was like, what, $800,000 a day? Yeah.

1966
02:14:23,348 --> 02:14:28,170
And so this extrapolated out to, like, 300 million in a year over 20 years.

1967
02:14:28,280 --> 02:14:28,842
Over ten years.

1968
02:14:28,856 --> 02:14:29,550
Over ten years.

1969
02:14:29,600 --> 02:14:30,214
Sandy Hook.

1970
02:14:30,262 --> 02:14:30,798
Sure.

1971
02:14:30,944 --> 02:14:36,538
I think that that's what I don't even remember if Mark made any statement of 3 billion.

1972
02:14:36,634 --> 02:14:36,894
Right.

1973
02:14:36,932 --> 02:14:39,642
But it's like, okay, you made $300 million a year.

1974
02:14:39,716 --> 02:14:45,210
Ten years since you've made, in theory, $3 billion since then.

1975
02:14:45,320 --> 02:14:52,390
I think that's where Alex may be taking that number from, but I never heard that as, like, what, he should be penalized.

1976
02:14:52,450 --> 02:14:52,674
Yeah.

1977
02:14:52,712 --> 02:15:03,690
I really wish that the way that amount of money was reported was based on why it was chosen.

1978
02:15:04,070 --> 02:15:13,098
I understand that the 24% of Americans is 75 million Americans, so the idea is one dollars for each American.

1979
02:15:13,184 --> 02:15:13,362
Right.

1980
02:15:13,376 --> 02:15:14,254
There's a symbolism.

1981
02:15:14,302 --> 02:15:14,550
Yeah.

1982
02:15:14,600 --> 02:15:20,874
But it kept going back to, like, oh, they want money, or they want money, or it was about how huge the sum was.

1983
02:15:20,972 --> 02:15:32,790
If they really just like, listen, the Sandy Hook families believe that because of Alex, alex owes them $1 for person that believes that they're a liar.

1984
02:15:33,590 --> 02:15:35,394
That makes sense to me.

1985
02:15:35,492 --> 02:15:45,546
And it also makes it feel like the judgment isn't that high, because if you had said that they owe $10 per person, I wouldn't think that that's a huge judgment, and that's $1.5 billion.

1986
02:15:45,668 --> 02:15:46,206
True.

1987
02:15:46,328 --> 02:15:47,118
So there's that.

1988
02:15:47,204 --> 02:15:52,842
And the other aspect of it, too, is, like, you don't start a negotiation low.

1989
02:15:52,916 --> 02:15:53,610
Oh, of course.

1990
02:15:53,720 --> 02:15:54,920
Absolutely not.

1991
02:15:55,790 --> 02:15:59,382
It's a number that you don't necessarily expect you're going to get.

1992
02:15:59,516 --> 02:16:02,658
And then the misunderstanding of the symbolism I agree with you.

1993
02:16:02,684 --> 02:16:07,518
That could have been the symbolism was what was really important about the money and not the money.

1994
02:16:07,604 --> 02:16:07,818
Yeah.

1995
02:16:07,844 --> 02:16:09,406
And that's what was so frustrating.

1996
02:16:09,478 --> 02:16:10,100
Yes.

1997
02:16:10,850 --> 02:16:12,846
Alex's statement goes on.

1998
02:16:13,028 --> 02:16:15,320
Now, here's the next phase of this.

1999
02:16:15,710 --> 02:16:22,926
When the judge realized that when I was on the stand, I woke that jury up and laid out the facts, she ruled today.

2000
02:16:23,048 --> 02:16:24,030
Of course you did.

2001
02:16:24,140 --> 02:16:27,270
Putative damage phase that starts tomorrow.

2002
02:16:27,590 --> 02:16:33,334
I cannot testify, and my lawyer cannot put on evidence.

2003
02:16:33,502 --> 02:16:38,190
So she already found me guilty and told the jury I was guilty.

2004
02:16:39,890 --> 02:16:45,246
And now she's saying we can't defend ourselves in the punitive damages face.

2005
02:16:45,428 --> 02:16:46,686
I trust in God.

2006
02:16:46,808 --> 02:16:48,474
I trust in the truth coming out.

2007
02:16:48,572 --> 02:16:49,866
So this just isn't true.

2008
02:16:49,988 --> 02:16:52,834
Raynal gave a defense in the punitive phase of the trial.

2009
02:16:52,882 --> 02:16:55,290
Just as west did for the plaintiffs.

2010
02:16:55,790 --> 02:17:03,382
The defense wasn't able to call any witnesses because the purpose of that phase of the trial was to determine net worth of both Alex and free speech systems.

2011
02:17:03,466 --> 02:17:15,514
And after repeatedly failing to provide ordered documents and repeatedly sending in incompetent corporate representatives, the judge sanctioned Alex's defense by disallowing him from being able to participate in the net worth discussion.

2012
02:17:15,562 --> 02:17:21,282
At this point, essentially, this is not a silencing or an instance of Alex being jammed up.

2013
02:17:21,356 --> 02:17:30,946
It's just another case of him not doing the bare minimum he was required to do in the discovery phase of the case, and now it's too late for him to pretend he wants to be involved.

2014
02:17:31,138 --> 02:17:37,630
Plus, Alex violated the rules on multiple occasions the prior day, including lying to the jury by saying he was bankrupt.

2015
02:17:37,690 --> 02:17:44,746
So on that count alone, he should not be able to be a witness in this part of the case he lied on under oath.

2016
02:17:44,878 --> 02:17:47,314
Nothing that he said can really be accepted as credible.

2017
02:17:47,362 --> 02:17:52,734
So his evidentiary value is zero unless he were to have produced the documents backing up what he says.

2018
02:17:52,892 --> 02:17:54,714
Which brings us to the next problem.

2019
02:17:54,872 --> 02:18:03,414
One of the primary things that was brought up as it relates to his text being disclosed was the messages from Tim Fruge, which discussed detailed breakdowns of sales numbers.

2020
02:18:03,572 --> 02:18:06,778
These numbers did not match the revenue numbers that Alex has claimed.

2021
02:18:06,814 --> 02:18:17,682
And even more importantly, the existence of these texts, which were not turned over in discovery, reveal an attempt to hide information relevant to the determination of net worth and the company's value.

2022
02:18:17,876 --> 02:18:26,394
There are three major reasons that Alex is not being allowed to be a part of this phase of the trial, and it has nothing to do with the Democratic Party or conspiracy against him.

2023
02:18:26,492 --> 02:18:29,790
It's the simple consequences of his stupid actions.

2024
02:18:30,170 --> 02:18:33,474
You can probably get the basic tone of this announcement already.

2025
02:18:33,632 --> 02:18:39,982
It's Alex taking this $4 million judgment quite in stride because it's much lower than he was probably fearing.

2026
02:18:40,126 --> 02:18:53,698
His tone is essentially no different than when he's gotten other bad news in the past, where he's using it as an opportunity to fundraise off of it, more or less trying to get the audience to flip the bill for him so he can remain insulated from the consequences of his actions.

2027
02:18:53,854 --> 02:19:14,854
It's pathetic, but it's what you'd expect because he's always been able to do this before, whether it's his dad paying for the medical bills that Kitty almost killed, or his dad buying advertising on his show so a radio station would air him early on, or the audience donating to his suspiciously timed money bombs, or his suspiciously timed $8 million bitcoin donation.

2028
02:19:15,022 --> 02:19:19,402
Alex has always had people to bail him out of the trouble of his stupid actions.

2029
02:19:19,546 --> 02:19:24,270
And he probably thinks, based on his $4 million figure, this is just going to be another in that series.

2030
02:19:24,590 --> 02:19:27,930
Yeah, and there's very little reason for him not to think that.

2031
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:28,314
Yeah.

2032
02:19:28,352 --> 02:19:37,230
I mean, if it were me in Alex's shoes, I would have received that judgment as a massive victory.

2033
02:19:37,850 --> 02:19:45,260
But that's only because if it's me and Alex's shoes, i, much like Alex, have forgotten that there are more trials coming.

2034
02:19:45,950 --> 02:19:48,162
I have completely forgotten that.

2035
02:19:48,236 --> 02:19:50,982
That means more judgments are coming as well.

2036
02:19:51,056 --> 02:19:51,366
True.

2037
02:19:51,428 --> 02:19:53,254
So I'm overjoyed.

2038
02:19:53,302 --> 02:19:56,482
I am announcing my victory over the Democratic Party.

2039
02:19:56,566 --> 02:19:58,378
It's a thrill up until the midterm.

2040
02:19:58,414 --> 02:19:59,050
Could have been worse.

2041
02:19:59,110 --> 02:20:00,058
Yeah, it could have been worse.

2042
02:20:00,094 --> 02:20:00,680
Yes.

2043
02:20:02,150 --> 02:20:05,886
The plaintiff lawyers, though, they were not happy about this.

2044
02:20:06,008 --> 02:20:07,902
They don't like that Alex won.

2045
02:20:08,096 --> 02:20:12,766
At the end of the day, I don't have all these millions of dollars they claim I have, so I'm at peace.

2046
02:20:12,958 --> 02:20:16,486
But this is still a major victory for truth.

2047
02:20:16,618 --> 02:20:31,998
And the plaintiff's lawyers got upset in the courtroom and according to multiple witnesses, were screaming and yelling at my lawyers, Joe, andandino when they were in the hall, they thought they would get hundreds of millions of dollars we don't have.

2048
02:20:32,144 --> 02:20:34,460
They thought they would shut us down.

2049
02:20:34,790 --> 02:20:40,774
But that jury understood the truth and resisted the propaganda.

2050
02:20:40,882 --> 02:20:45,598
This does not at all match my experience with the Plant displayers.

2051
02:20:45,694 --> 02:20:52,040
I mean, I don't know who these two sources Alex has, but I think they're Lieutenant Colonels, probably.

2052
02:20:52,550 --> 02:21:04,462
It is this exact video that should be played further in the other trials just because this was after the judgment.

2053
02:21:04,606 --> 02:21:11,634
If you think that damages are going to make him stop and he can still be in business, that is not how this works.

2054
02:21:11,732 --> 02:21:15,258
He's in there and he is doing his shit or he's out.

2055
02:21:15,344 --> 02:21:17,710
There is no getting him to moderate.

2056
02:21:17,830 --> 02:21:30,598
Yeah, but I think that's difficult to I think you and I can say that saying that in a legal setting, I think is well, presupposes that, you know, 100% the future, which you can't do in a courtroom, I assume.

2057
02:21:30,694 --> 02:21:30,990
Right.

2058
02:21:31,040 --> 02:21:38,098
But it also presupposes that it is appropriate to be like, I want to bankrupt him as a punishment.

2059
02:21:38,194 --> 02:21:42,750
And I don't know if that is necessarily healthy.

2060
02:21:45,090 --> 02:21:47,014
I feel like this is so important.

2061
02:21:47,112 --> 02:21:51,878
It is not that well, I understand bankruptcy.

2062
02:21:52,034 --> 02:22:03,418
I mean, this way, if the point of the trial, if the point of the damages is to punish someone to get them to stop their behavior right.

2063
02:22:03,564 --> 02:22:08,974
And this is what they do after that judgment, then it's not about money at that point.

2064
02:22:09,012 --> 02:22:19,786
It has to be, how do we make this behavior stop? So I don't care if the judgment is ten jillion dollars or it's literally just a guy going like, hey, listen, you got to turn the lights off.

2065
02:22:19,908 --> 02:22:21,262
That's just what's got to happen.

2066
02:22:21,336 --> 02:22:23,062
It's not about the money kind of thing.

2067
02:22:23,076 --> 02:22:27,298
You know what, I just think it's difficult to translate that from what I think you're saying.

2068
02:22:27,324 --> 02:22:30,494
That makes total sense in this conversation to a courtroom.

2069
02:22:30,542 --> 02:22:44,278
I think that's a challenge impossible and it's also incredibly difficult, because when you have something like this happens, it's just an opportunity for Alex to trick his audience into being more money.

2070
02:22:44,364 --> 02:22:46,426
Listen, we're in bankruptcy right now.

2071
02:22:46,488 --> 02:22:47,734
Listen, we're maxed out.

2072
02:22:47,772 --> 02:22:56,350
Listen, we are fighting hard for your First Amendment, your Second Amendment, your 10th Amendment, your sovereignty, not your choice if you want to keep us in the fight.

2073
02:22:56,400 --> 02:22:59,342
We have a plan to stay on air through this bankruptcy.

2074
02:22:59,366 --> 02:23:06,490
We have a reorganization plan, but if you don't fund us, if you don't buy products at Info Worthstore.com, we will shut down.

2075
02:23:06,660 --> 02:23:07,778
It's your decision.

2076
02:23:07,874 --> 02:23:14,220
Just like that jury had a decision right now on whether Infowars is going to stay on the air.

2077
02:23:14,730 --> 02:23:21,694
We are so broke that I'm not even worried about that $4.2 million.

2078
02:23:21,852 --> 02:23:30,226
I'm worried about our bankruptcy to emergency stabilized Info or we have a plan, but to do that, we need support.

2079
02:23:30,288 --> 02:23:36,180
So get a T shirt, get a book, get a film, or get some of my supplements that under oath have been proven to be great.

2080
02:23:36,930 --> 02:23:37,682
Wild.

2081
02:23:37,826 --> 02:23:39,230
Just wild shape.

2082
02:23:39,410 --> 02:23:41,602
What do you expect? It's exactly what you'd expect.

2083
02:23:41,676 --> 02:23:42,058
Yes.

2084
02:23:42,144 --> 02:23:52,318
Now, what I didn't expect with that is for this announcement that Alex makes to go the direction it does, because when there's a direction to go from there yes.

2085
02:23:52,404 --> 02:23:53,038
Oh, God.

2086
02:23:53,124 --> 02:23:55,298
He starts talking about Neil and Scarlett.

2087
02:23:55,394 --> 02:23:55,762
No.

2088
02:23:55,836 --> 02:23:57,000
What? No.

2089
02:23:58,350 --> 02:23:59,280
Mike down.

2090
02:24:00,030 --> 02:24:04,114
Get them all at Info werestore.com and keep us on the air.

2091
02:24:04,272 --> 02:24:07,690
That is so critical because they use these families as ponds.

2092
02:24:08,250 --> 02:24:17,450
The families come over and shook my hand and hug me and really woke up the fact that they'd been manipulated and their own lawyers went like they were dogs.

2093
02:24:17,510 --> 02:24:20,280
Get over here and stop talking to him on video.

2094
02:24:21,870 --> 02:24:23,100
I was wrong.

2095
02:24:24,090 --> 02:24:25,234
Sandy Hook happened.

2096
02:24:25,332 --> 02:24:26,590
I admit it happened.

2097
02:24:26,640 --> 02:24:29,374
I'm proud to admit it happened, because when I'm wrong, I admit it.

2098
02:24:29,412 --> 02:24:31,466
I don't make mistakes on purpose.

2099
02:24:31,538 --> 02:24:32,722
We're tomorrow's news today.

2100
02:24:32,796 --> 02:24:34,574
We're 95% accurate.

2101
02:24:34,742 --> 02:24:38,606
But these people tried to misrepresent what I said to these families.

2102
02:24:38,678 --> 02:24:40,246
They showed them edited videos.

2103
02:24:40,368 --> 02:24:45,010
They showed the jury edited videos, and it backfired in their face big time.

2104
02:24:45,120 --> 02:24:45,394
Yeah.

2105
02:24:45,432 --> 02:24:52,010
So he's creating this perception that Neil and Scarlett are Info warriors.

2106
02:24:52,070 --> 02:24:52,680
Now.

2107
02:24:53,430 --> 02:24:58,642
They woke up to the fact that their lawyers were manipulating this case.

2108
02:24:58,716 --> 02:24:58,990
Yeah.

2109
02:24:59,040 --> 02:25:06,262
I realized that my comments about the previous clips have come too soon, and I would like to reiterate them about that clip, but, like, twice as much.

2110
02:25:06,456 --> 02:25:07,306
Yeah, it's bad.

2111
02:25:07,368 --> 02:25:08,554
Yeah, that's fucked up.

2112
02:25:08,592 --> 02:25:09,540
Yeah, it's bad.

2113
02:25:11,310 --> 02:25:12,398
No, it can't get worse.

2114
02:25:12,434 --> 02:25:12,946
It does.

2115
02:25:13,008 --> 02:25:13,558
Oh, God.

2116
02:25:13,644 --> 02:25:19,474
I told and my lawyer told that jury, I said, listen, we want to pay for their psychological stuff.

2117
02:25:19,572 --> 02:25:20,854
We want to take care of problems.

2118
02:25:20,952 --> 02:25:24,838
We didn't cause all of it, but we want to step up and prove that and do that.

2119
02:25:24,924 --> 02:25:31,826
And Scarlett Lewis has a beautiful organization called Choose Love that isn't about gun control, isn't about liberal conservative.

2120
02:25:31,898 --> 02:25:37,642
It's about teaching children love and compassion so they're not hateful, so they're not satanic, so they don't kill people.

2121
02:25:37,716 --> 02:25:40,582
And I have invited Scarlett Lewis on my show.

2122
02:25:40,776 --> 02:25:42,326
We're going to email organization.

2123
02:25:42,458 --> 02:25:51,658
If I see her tomorrow during the punitive face, I'm going to shake her hand and give her my number, and I am going to gladly have her on my show next week.

2124
02:25:51,684 --> 02:26:00,038
And I'm going to raise money for her organization on top of the big judgment because she's a real lady.

2125
02:26:00,134 --> 02:26:01,234
She lost her child.

2126
02:26:01,332 --> 02:26:08,086
And I'm not going to let these people misrepresent what I said and did anymore and claim that I'm a Sandy hook man.

2127
02:26:08,208 --> 02:26:09,826
This is a beautiful time.

2128
02:26:09,948 --> 02:26:11,314
It's a great time.

2129
02:26:11,472 --> 02:26:17,760
And the trial lawyers, the ambulance chasers lost America, and the first amendment won.

2130
02:26:18,090 --> 02:26:24,334
And the poor parents that went through so much, neil hesley and Scarlett Lewis, they have won as well.

2131
02:26:24,492 --> 02:26:25,838
So this is a big victory.

2132
02:26:25,874 --> 02:26:26,858
An answer to prayer.

2133
02:26:26,954 --> 02:26:30,802
Thank you so much to viewers and listeners who are continuing on as long as you support us.

2134
02:26:30,816 --> 02:26:36,694
We were so close to being shut down, so please support us so we can have Scarlett Lewis and Ilhaslin on.

2135
02:26:36,732 --> 02:26:38,174
I'm going to take them out to dinner.

2136
02:26:38,282 --> 02:26:39,862
Their lawyers are going to try to stop them.

2137
02:26:39,876 --> 02:26:41,518
I mean, I literally yesterday saw them.

2138
02:26:41,604 --> 02:26:43,138
Neil tried to follow me out and shook my hand.

2139
02:26:43,164 --> 02:26:44,614
He goes, hey, buddy, I want to talk to you.

2140
02:26:44,652 --> 02:26:45,982
I said, yes, sir, please come out.

2141
02:26:46,056 --> 02:26:49,426
Their lawyer said, get over here to him.

2142
02:26:49,548 --> 02:26:52,440
I'll never talk to them like a dog.

2143
02:26:53,550 --> 02:26:56,100
I'll see you tomorrow on the Friday show.

2144
02:26:56,670 --> 02:27:08,186
So it's strange to hear Alex say that he and his lawyers said they wanted to pay Neil and Scarlett's medical expenses and such because I was in the courtroom during raynall's opening statement where he asked the jury to return a judgment of $1 in damages.

2145
02:27:08,258 --> 02:27:11,220
I do recall he held a dollar up.

2146
02:27:14,350 --> 02:27:15,330
It was a callback.

2147
02:27:15,390 --> 02:27:15,974
Yeah.

2148
02:27:16,132 --> 02:27:18,846
Closing statement in the cross examination of Alex.

2149
02:27:19,038 --> 02:27:26,802
Alex is such a disgusting liar, and this is just an attempt on his part to exploit his audience's obvious lack of awareness of what's actually happening in the trial.

2150
02:27:26,946 --> 02:27:30,606
Scarlett wanted to hug Alex and realize he was being used by the lawyers.

2151
02:27:30,678 --> 02:27:32,934
He told the jury he wanted to pay their expenses.

2152
02:27:33,042 --> 02:27:34,722
All this is complete shit.

2153
02:27:34,866 --> 02:27:40,178
And more importantly, Alex knows fully well that he's just lying to his audience, so they keep giving him money.

2154
02:27:40,324 --> 02:27:43,370
And then also, like the scarlett has a great organization.

2155
02:27:43,990 --> 02:27:49,322
His corporate representative, daria, under oath, testified that she suspects that it's a front.

2156
02:27:49,456 --> 02:27:50,186
Yes.

2157
02:27:50,368 --> 02:27:55,842
Also, this is Alex's attempt to portray himself as the good guy, which is all based in bullshit.

2158
02:27:55,986 --> 02:28:02,898
Further, he's putting Neil and Scarlett into a trap where he's casting them as characters and his personal image rehabilitation.

2159
02:28:03,054 --> 02:28:13,898
As far as the audience is concerned, they either get to play along and act how Alex is setting them up to which they aren't going to do, or they'll be seen suspiciously by the audience all over again.

2160
02:28:14,044 --> 02:28:22,202
Why aren't they speaking out in support of Alex after they realize that they were being used by the lawyers to attack the First Amendment? Maybe the evil lawyers won't let them.

2161
02:28:22,276 --> 02:28:29,690
Or maybe they just said that to Alex to pacify him during the trial and they actually are in league with the deep state Democrat lawyers after all.

2162
02:28:29,800 --> 02:28:35,210
Come to think of it, that would mean that they would have to put on a pretty good performance to trick Alex, of all people.

2163
02:28:35,320 --> 02:28:39,758
What if these people are actors after all? Maybe that's not the direction it would necessarily go.

2164
02:28:39,784 --> 02:28:50,550
But Alex is forcing Neil and Scarlett to exist in terms of his bullshit show into the future, because creating these fictitious pictures of them is helpful in terms of making Alex feel better about himself.

2165
02:28:50,730 --> 02:28:55,660
What he really should be doing is leaving them the fuck alone, which they've wanted all along.

2166
02:28:56,050 --> 02:29:02,126
But Alex is kind of like a child who's broken something and then is trying to clean it up, but he doesn't know how to clean.

2167
02:29:02,188 --> 02:29:04,598
So in the process, he ends up breaking more stuff.

2168
02:29:04,744 --> 02:29:08,946
You just want them to stop trying to help because they're not helping and they're just making things worse.

2169
02:29:09,018 --> 02:29:11,030
But they're a dumb kid and they don't get that.

2170
02:29:11,140 --> 02:29:14,814
He's kind of like that kid, except he broke that original thing on purpose.

2171
02:29:14,922 --> 02:29:19,670
He claims that he didn't, and then he's breaking other stuff to distract from the mess he initially made.

2172
02:29:19,780 --> 02:29:23,414
It's like a sociopathic version of that kid who broke something.

2173
02:29:23,512 --> 02:29:25,374
Yeah, he's a fucking asshole.

2174
02:29:25,422 --> 02:29:27,642
Yeah, that's so fucked.

2175
02:29:27,786 --> 02:29:31,806
But that's another part of the amorphous blob of denying Sandy Hook.

2176
02:29:31,938 --> 02:29:33,830
Now I get it.

2177
02:29:33,940 --> 02:29:41,726
I say Sandy Hook is 100% real because I've changed the goalpost to now the lawyers are manipulating these people.

2178
02:29:41,848 --> 02:29:44,018
That is just the same thing.

2179
02:29:44,104 --> 02:29:46,598
It's all one big thing.

2180
02:29:46,684 --> 02:29:49,154
It's not that he denied Sandy Hook happened.

2181
02:29:49,252 --> 02:29:52,670
It's that Sandy Hook is part of whatever it is he wants.

2182
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:55,540
You understand that that is exactly the model.

2183
02:29:56,530 --> 02:29:57,918
You have to play the full clip.

2184
02:29:57,954 --> 02:29:58,334
Absolutely.

2185
02:29:58,432 --> 02:29:59,226
The full clip.

2186
02:29:59,298 --> 02:30:00,882
Oh, I need a timeline.

2187
02:30:00,966 --> 02:30:01,794
Give him a timeline.

2188
02:30:01,842 --> 02:30:03,294
There's going to be another excuse.

2189
02:30:03,402 --> 02:30:05,958
And even think about it in terms of world events.

2190
02:30:05,994 --> 02:30:08,442
Like you have this lead up to the 2016 election.

2191
02:30:08,466 --> 02:30:10,634
It's like we need to get Trump in.

2192
02:30:10,672 --> 02:30:14,054
Because if you have a Democrat in it's so bad, Trump gets in.

2193
02:30:14,092 --> 02:30:16,406
Oh, no, there's enemies within the deep state.

2194
02:30:16,468 --> 02:30:22,250
Is that's why everything sucks? Yeah, it's always something else.

2195
02:30:22,360 --> 02:30:26,882
The conspiracy in the narrative has to shift because that is where the money is.

2196
02:30:27,016 --> 02:30:31,226
That is where the ability to keep his audience interested is.

2197
02:30:31,288 --> 02:30:38,642
Without that, like, oh, we won, or, oh, I was actually wrong, let's move on, doesn't play.

2198
02:30:38,716 --> 02:30:39,966
There isn't an angle.

2199
02:30:40,038 --> 02:30:41,334
He's just a coward.

2200
02:30:41,502 --> 02:30:42,830
Well, yeah, that too.

2201
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:48,026
So he does have the balls to show up on the War Room.

2202
02:30:48,208 --> 02:30:48,974
Oh, boy.

2203
02:30:49,072 --> 02:30:52,358
Hard hitting interview with time.

2204
02:30:52,384 --> 02:30:55,274
He had an adversarial conversation with the press.

2205
02:30:55,432 --> 02:31:03,438
He might have an adversarial conversation with Owen once the paychecks stopped clearing, but it would be a good time to for now, it's friendly.

2206
02:31:03,534 --> 02:31:15,050
So Alex has recorded this announcement and statement and he comes on with Owen, and a lot of it is kind of rehashing some of the same stuff, but he has some other things that he says that I think are really shitty.

2207
02:31:15,670 --> 02:31:21,414
Well, I might be going down with a Titanic, but I get the first exclusive interview with Alex Jones.

2208
02:31:21,462 --> 02:31:22,614
Play that violin, baby.

2209
02:31:22,662 --> 02:31:23,894
Person on earth right now.

2210
02:31:23,992 --> 02:31:26,966
No, not very good news about Kobi being made in the lab.

2211
02:31:27,028 --> 02:31:30,134
No, not because he covered Jeffrey Epstein while everyone else was covering it up.

2212
02:31:30,172 --> 02:31:39,426
No, not because he told you about the globalist corporate world government with carbon taxes, but no, because they think they've destroyed him now and the lies get to permeate on Twitter.

2213
02:31:39,498 --> 02:31:42,400
But Alex, you're not allowed on there to defend yourself.

2214
02:31:42,970 --> 02:31:43,646
That's right.

2215
02:31:43,708 --> 02:31:44,402
Here we are.

2216
02:31:44,476 --> 02:31:47,178
The jury came in on the big verdict.

2217
02:31:47,214 --> 02:31:50,070
Tens of millions spent by the Democratic Party law firms.

2218
02:31:50,250 --> 02:31:56,510
And the jury came in at 4.2 million when they asked for 150,000,002 days ago.

2219
02:31:56,620 --> 02:31:58,242
3 billion yesterday.

2220
02:31:58,386 --> 02:32:03,186
I don't have $2 million in the bank or anywhere.

2221
02:32:03,318 --> 02:32:06,580
Seems like a bland version of triumph for him.

2222
02:32:06,910 --> 02:32:09,342
There's a victory to it, but it's also blah.

2223
02:32:09,426 --> 02:32:10,060
Right.

2224
02:32:10,750 --> 02:32:13,960
They didn't spend tens of millions on that case.

2225
02:32:16,090 --> 02:32:18,926
But you need to think that, cause then you win.

2226
02:32:19,048 --> 02:32:20,990
They're down ten, I'm down 4 million.

2227
02:32:21,040 --> 02:32:21,218
Sure.

2228
02:32:21,244 --> 02:32:24,302
But they're down so much more trying to get me right.

2229
02:32:24,376 --> 02:32:29,490
And yeah, that's the perception that Alex wants and I don't think that has any bearing on reality.

2230
02:32:29,550 --> 02:32:39,738
Yes, Alex can't be like, listen, the law firm that they're specifically went through, the lead plaintiff's attorney said that he only eats what he kills.

2231
02:32:39,834 --> 02:32:41,382
So obviously they spent.

2232
02:32:41,466 --> 02:32:42,100
Yeah.

2233
02:32:42,490 --> 02:32:45,998
So it's a low verdict according to Alex on War Room.

2234
02:32:46,144 --> 02:32:49,154
The good news is it's a very low verdict for what they're asking for.

2235
02:32:49,252 --> 02:32:52,082
The bad news is we don't have the money to pay for it.

2236
02:32:52,096 --> 02:32:53,666
We can get a bond and appeal it.

2237
02:32:53,728 --> 02:32:54,434
We're going to move forward.

2238
02:32:54,472 --> 02:33:03,674
That's why I explained to listeners, you want to see the War Room or you want to see Alex Jones or you want to see Harry Smith or you want to see did everybody else.

2239
02:33:03,712 --> 02:33:08,222
If you want to see what we're doing here, we need your support@infoworkartstore.com.

2240
02:33:08,356 --> 02:33:12,270
And I was going to testify tomorrow, which under Texas law impede damages.

2241
02:33:12,330 --> 02:33:14,370
You're supposed to have the person under attack testify.

2242
02:33:14,490 --> 02:33:18,954
The judge ruled after the ruling today when they got that low ruling.

2243
02:33:19,002 --> 02:33:20,306
Sounds like a lot for the average person.

2244
02:33:20,368 --> 02:33:22,994
It is a lot, but for what they were asking for, it's small.

2245
02:33:23,092 --> 02:33:26,918
That I cannot speak tomorrow and my lawyer cannot put on.

2246
02:33:26,944 --> 02:33:29,082
Evidence because we're defaulted.

2247
02:33:29,166 --> 02:33:32,942
So she gets more and more desperate as she rigged this whole thing.

2248
02:33:33,076 --> 02:33:38,178
So it's rigged, but no matter what the judgment was, he would not be allowed to participate.

2249
02:33:38,274 --> 02:33:39,998
There's no bearing on any of that.

2250
02:33:40,084 --> 02:33:44,534
I mean, you just can't commit perjury one day and then still come back the next day.

2251
02:33:44,572 --> 02:33:46,562
Particularly about financial stuff.

2252
02:33:46,696 --> 02:33:59,150
But even so, the sanctions in terms of the default judgment, a big part of it is not cooperating with this stuff.

2253
02:33:59,260 --> 02:34:08,534
There was a time to provide that evidence and he very much didn't and was given multiple opportunities to clear that up and fix that.

2254
02:34:08,632 --> 02:34:09,138
He didn't.

2255
02:34:09,174 --> 02:34:15,640
You don't just get to swoop in and be like, AHA, now I will reveal everything.

2256
02:34:16,270 --> 02:34:17,486
It's not others works.

2257
02:34:17,548 --> 02:34:18,160
Yeah.

2258
02:34:19,030 --> 02:34:24,330
It's that example of you're never going to win with Alex.

2259
02:34:24,390 --> 02:34:24,686
Yeah.

2260
02:34:24,748 --> 02:34:27,438
He lives in a reality where he always wins.

2261
02:34:27,534 --> 02:34:34,754
So you're never going to get him to be like, oh, you're right, I fucked up in a way that means anything.

2262
02:34:34,792 --> 02:34:35,742
That's too threatening.

2263
02:34:35,826 --> 02:34:36,290
Exactly.

2264
02:34:36,400 --> 02:34:38,594
So he just switches into a different world.

2265
02:34:38,632 --> 02:34:41,930
And if he's guilty in this world, he's going to switch into a different one.

2266
02:34:41,980 --> 02:34:42,230
Yeah.

2267
02:34:42,280 --> 02:34:43,060
It's crazy.

2268
02:34:43,990 --> 02:34:44,946
The MCU.

2269
02:34:45,018 --> 02:34:50,570
But it's obviously this is all just trying to get money.

2270
02:34:50,680 --> 02:34:54,918
And Alex thought he'd be making more money, honestly, and he's a little disappointed.

2271
02:34:55,014 --> 02:34:58,266
But I'll tell you, I don't say this mainly to the crew.

2272
02:34:58,458 --> 02:35:00,626
We're in bankruptcy right now.

2273
02:35:00,808 --> 02:35:04,850
And I thought in bankruptcy, we could bring in the money we needed.

2274
02:35:04,900 --> 02:35:05,978
Right now we're not.

2275
02:35:06,124 --> 02:35:18,930
So it's a pirate victory if you don't fund info or worstore.com, order a book, order a film, get Bodies Ultimate Tumor formula, get vitamin fusion, get all the great products and infowars.

2276
02:35:18,990 --> 02:35:21,050
You've invested so much in us.

2277
02:35:21,160 --> 02:35:25,070
We've invested in you are in this together over the last 28 years on air.

2278
02:35:25,180 --> 02:35:27,746
Now is the critical juncture in the fight.

2279
02:35:27,868 --> 02:35:35,382
Now is the last few minutes of the basketball game or the football game where everybody is in a tie in a dead heat.

2280
02:35:35,466 --> 02:35:38,366
Now is the big boy pants time.

2281
02:35:38,488 --> 02:35:40,658
Now is the time to decide where you're at.

2282
02:35:40,684 --> 02:35:41,682
You've got my commitment.

2283
02:35:41,766 --> 02:35:42,914
I'll never back down.

2284
02:35:43,012 --> 02:35:44,142
I'll never surrender.

2285
02:35:44,226 --> 02:35:45,446
I'll never go away.

2286
02:35:45,568 --> 02:35:46,742
But I could give out.

2287
02:35:46,816 --> 02:35:49,130
Please support us@inforestore.com.

2288
02:35:49,240 --> 02:35:51,760
It is, once again, Big Boy pants time.

2289
02:35:54,290 --> 02:35:55,866
It's big boy pants time.

2290
02:35:55,988 --> 02:35:58,854
I regret to inform you it is Big Boy Pants time.

2291
02:35:58,892 --> 02:36:00,714
I wish it was Burger Boy pants time.

2292
02:36:00,812 --> 02:36:01,462
Nick Weger.

2293
02:36:01,546 --> 02:36:02,934
Yeah, sure.

2294
02:36:03,032 --> 02:36:03,738
Oh, boy.

2295
02:36:03,824 --> 02:36:04,834
That meme.

2296
02:36:05,002 --> 02:36:09,980
Someone made I struggled with that a little bit.

2297
02:36:11,310 --> 02:36:12,350
It's a little unfair.

2298
02:36:12,410 --> 02:36:13,334
It's a little unfair.

2299
02:36:13,382 --> 02:36:19,310
But then also think about it like you're the Nick in the doughboy's comparison.

2300
02:36:19,430 --> 02:36:21,626
Our picture of us on Bible sources.

2301
02:36:21,698 --> 02:36:22,222
Right.

2302
02:36:22,356 --> 02:36:24,338
You're married, Nick's? Married.

2303
02:36:24,434 --> 02:36:24,946
Okay.

2304
02:36:25,068 --> 02:36:26,606
I am Mitch.

2305
02:36:26,798 --> 02:36:27,742
I have a cat.

2306
02:36:27,816 --> 02:36:28,694
Mitch has cats.

2307
02:36:28,742 --> 02:36:29,340
Okay.

2308
02:36:29,790 --> 02:36:30,706
Squinty eyes.

2309
02:36:30,768 --> 02:36:32,374
Both of us have squinty eyes.

2310
02:36:32,532 --> 02:36:34,738
I grew up in Boston for a while.

2311
02:36:34,824 --> 02:36:36,422
He's from Quincy.

2312
02:36:36,506 --> 02:36:38,618
I did not know there were this many similarities.

2313
02:36:38,654 --> 02:36:40,282
There are more than I'm comfortable with it.

2314
02:36:40,296 --> 02:36:43,378
I didn't realize none of this even occurred to me.

2315
02:36:43,464 --> 02:36:49,390
Do you like hot salad? Honestly, I have no doughboy's references whatsoever.

2316
02:36:50,370 --> 02:36:55,198
Whenever that meat thing came out, I was like, I really don't know who Nick and Mitch are.

2317
02:36:55,284 --> 02:36:58,514
I was like, wait, I love doughboys.

2318
02:36:58,622 --> 02:37:00,922
I would, honestly, if they want me to.

2319
02:37:00,936 --> 02:37:01,582
Come on.

2320
02:37:01,716 --> 02:37:02,578
Hey, you're available.

2321
02:37:02,664 --> 02:37:04,270
But yeah.

2322
02:37:04,320 --> 02:37:11,230
The only thing that obviously there's some nuances here and there, but I do not think that cakes are pies.

2323
02:37:13,290 --> 02:37:14,566
I haven't shaved in a while.

2324
02:37:14,628 --> 02:37:16,310
That was my reaction to that picture.

2325
02:37:16,370 --> 02:37:17,122
I'm sorry.

2326
02:37:17,256 --> 02:37:18,370
Cupcakes.

2327
02:37:18,690 --> 02:37:20,030
Cupcakes are pies.

2328
02:37:20,150 --> 02:37:21,142
That is not a pie.

2329
02:37:21,216 --> 02:37:21,526
No.

2330
02:37:21,588 --> 02:37:23,470
Until the day I die, that is not a pie.

2331
02:37:23,520 --> 02:37:24,120
No.

2332
02:37:24,870 --> 02:37:25,894
That threw me for one.

2333
02:37:25,932 --> 02:37:28,860
Anyway, big boy pants time.

2334
02:37:29,190 --> 02:37:30,410
Big boy pants.

2335
02:37:30,590 --> 02:37:41,100
So in this interview that Alex is doing on the War Room, he frames why people are mad about him, about Sandy Hook in a particular way.

2336
02:37:41,490 --> 02:37:43,994
Let's correct the record on a couple of things here, Alex.

2337
02:37:44,102 --> 02:37:48,418
The media today says Alex Jones concede Sandy Hook happened.

2338
02:37:48,504 --> 02:37:50,280
I believe he did that six years ago.

2339
02:37:51,330 --> 02:37:55,380
We barely covered Sandy Hook less than one 10th to 1% of the time.

2340
02:37:55,830 --> 02:37:58,534
But when Hillary ran against Trump, she dredged up things.

2341
02:37:58,572 --> 02:37:59,494
Take a question.

2342
02:37:59,652 --> 02:38:03,754
And there was some anomalies, but it turned out I believe it happened.

2343
02:38:03,852 --> 02:38:11,806
So the whole thing about why people are mad about Sandy Hook is just because Hillary needed to attack Trump about something and Alex was easy.

2344
02:38:11,928 --> 02:38:21,190
You may remember this as the entire framing device of how Sandy Hook is covered in Alex's War, the shitty documentary made by Alex Lee Moyer.

2345
02:38:21,690 --> 02:38:33,434
And I think that you see how patently absurd this is and how easily tricked she was as a filmmaker.

2346
02:38:33,482 --> 02:38:44,040
Yeah, that's a moment where you either got to go, I'm going to be 100% complicit in this average, or you have to go, I might be shitty at my job.

2347
02:38:44,910 --> 02:38:45,418
Yes.

2348
02:38:45,504 --> 02:38:57,286
So let's not dwell too much on this because we already did that episode and I was blocked and then unblocked by their let's not worry about it without doing anything.

2349
02:38:57,408 --> 02:38:58,690
I didn't respond to him at all.

2350
02:38:58,740 --> 02:39:00,034
I have no idea what happened.

2351
02:39:00,132 --> 02:39:07,874
Anyway, yeah, there's something really terrible about the way Alex proceeds to the end of this episode.

2352
02:39:08,042 --> 02:39:15,782
In that Special Report announcement thing he did, there's a characterization of Scarlett Neil, and it's unfair.

2353
02:39:15,866 --> 02:39:17,486
Yeah, it's inappropriate.

2354
02:39:17,618 --> 02:39:20,950
But what Alex does now is worse.

2355
02:39:21,270 --> 02:39:23,834
I am very thankful to God, very thankful to listeners.

2356
02:39:23,942 --> 02:39:27,550
And I want to invite Scarlett Lewis, who doesn't have a gun control group.

2357
02:39:27,720 --> 02:39:36,310
She has a group about children learning love and empathy and helping children that are beat up and helping people that are being bullied so they don't become this.

2358
02:39:36,360 --> 02:39:38,318
I totally support her grip.

2359
02:39:38,354 --> 02:39:39,142
Choose love.

2360
02:39:39,276 --> 02:39:46,318
She came over, shook my hand, gave me a hug repeatedly, and I told her, regardless of this ruling, I want her on air.

2361
02:39:46,404 --> 02:39:55,980
So tomorrow I'm barred from speaking at the trial, but I'm going to go with a letter I'm going to write tonight, and I'm going to hand it to her and Neil Hesleyn, who are very sweet people.

2362
02:39:56,370 --> 02:39:58,310
I didn't question them on purpose.

2363
02:39:58,370 --> 02:39:59,794
I didn't try to hurt them.

2364
02:39:59,892 --> 02:40:02,820
Once I met them, I saw, God, these are totally real people.

2365
02:40:03,210 --> 02:40:04,690
I was brought in to stuff.

2366
02:40:04,800 --> 02:40:05,974
It's good to question things.

2367
02:40:06,012 --> 02:40:07,798
But you never even said their name.

2368
02:40:07,884 --> 02:40:11,386
I said, Hesley's name one time covering the Meghan Kelly interview, but that was it.

2369
02:40:11,508 --> 02:40:14,618
But still, I do believe that they have some pains.

2370
02:40:14,714 --> 02:40:16,046
This is harassment.

2371
02:40:16,178 --> 02:40:18,780
Like that Alex is planning out on air.

2372
02:40:20,190 --> 02:40:20,940
Yes.

2373
02:40:22,890 --> 02:40:23,954
Like Dan Pedandi.

2374
02:40:24,002 --> 02:40:31,906
Their lawyers don't want me to talk to them, so I'm going to write a letter and slip it to them so I can invade their space.

2375
02:40:32,028 --> 02:40:37,550
I'm going to go to their house when their lawyers aren't there, and I'm going to slide this letter underneath their doorstep.

2376
02:40:37,610 --> 02:40:42,322
You know, like a sane person who's not harassing people would do, right? Wow.

2377
02:40:42,456 --> 02:40:44,482
So, anyway scarlett jesus Christ.

2378
02:40:44,556 --> 02:40:49,320
In particular, alex seems to be wanting to paint as his new best friend.

2379
02:40:49,710 --> 02:40:51,710
And this is just awful.

2380
02:40:51,890 --> 02:40:56,434
Tuesday, I did the morning show for an hour.

2381
02:40:56,472 --> 02:41:01,066
You came in and took over, and I said, I believe she's a real person.

2382
02:41:01,128 --> 02:41:02,110
I believe he's real.

2383
02:41:02,160 --> 02:41:03,658
I believe they're manipulating them.

2384
02:41:03,744 --> 02:41:05,750
And I'm sorry, it was a ten minute rant.

2385
02:41:05,930 --> 02:41:09,660
They cut it down to a minute with me saying it didn't happen.

2386
02:41:10,950 --> 02:41:12,830
That's why the video was so blurry.

2387
02:41:13,010 --> 02:41:14,090
It was all blurry.

2388
02:41:14,150 --> 02:41:15,238
You couldn't even see me, really.

2389
02:41:15,264 --> 02:41:16,046
It was this audio.

2390
02:41:16,118 --> 02:41:16,786
Oh, my God.

2391
02:41:16,848 --> 02:41:22,450
And I got on the stand and I said, Scarlett, go to the fourth segment.

2392
02:41:23,070 --> 02:41:26,206
Go to 33 after in my show today on stand.

2393
02:41:26,388 --> 02:41:27,454
I said, watch it.

2394
02:41:27,492 --> 02:41:28,498
I said, you're real.

2395
02:41:28,584 --> 02:41:29,818
I said, your son's real.

2396
02:41:29,904 --> 02:41:31,682
Whoever gave that to use a liar.

2397
02:41:31,766 --> 02:41:35,206
She got up and left, came back an hour later crying, and was like, oh.

2398
02:41:35,268 --> 02:41:36,480
And she said, well, you're right.

2399
02:41:37,590 --> 02:41:39,298
So we broke through that.

2400
02:41:39,324 --> 02:41:41,006
They're being handled and manipulated.

2401
02:41:41,138 --> 02:41:47,750
Is that the lawyers then giving them edited video? She said, on stand, I was given it by my supporters.

2402
02:41:47,930 --> 02:41:50,460
So the point is, they gave her a minute edited video.

2403
02:41:50,970 --> 02:41:52,094
Imagine the sickos.

2404
02:41:52,142 --> 02:41:52,726
I'm on everything.

2405
02:41:52,788 --> 02:41:53,698
I believe you're real.

2406
02:41:53,784 --> 02:41:54,842
I believe your son died.

2407
02:41:54,866 --> 02:41:55,786
I'm so sorry.

2408
02:41:55,908 --> 02:41:57,310
I want to work with you.

2409
02:41:57,420 --> 02:42:00,350
And I believe that your ex husband's son died.

2410
02:42:00,410 --> 02:42:01,654
And he's a great guy.

2411
02:42:01,752 --> 02:42:02,902
I think they manipulated him.

2412
02:42:02,916 --> 02:42:06,550
I think he's kind of simple, not dumb, smart, but very trusting.

2413
02:42:06,930 --> 02:42:08,302
He's a rodeo guy.

2414
02:42:08,436 --> 02:42:10,322
He's a cowboy, which are not dumb.

2415
02:42:10,346 --> 02:42:11,866
They're just really trusting, nice people.

2416
02:42:11,928 --> 02:42:13,090
I have family like that.

2417
02:42:13,200 --> 02:42:20,400
So she apparently went and watched the full video that Alex was referring her to.

2418
02:42:20,730 --> 02:42:27,010
She wept and then told Alex that she gets it and she's being used by these lawyers.

2419
02:42:28,110 --> 02:42:29,042
This is fucked.

2420
02:42:29,066 --> 02:42:29,290
Up.

2421
02:42:29,340 --> 02:42:35,290
I genuinely think she should sue for defamation.

2422
02:42:37,530 --> 02:42:39,600
I don't know what else to say about that.

2423
02:42:41,070 --> 02:42:43,418
I would take that as defaming a character.

2424
02:42:43,574 --> 02:42:44,518
I really would.

2425
02:42:44,604 --> 02:42:54,118
Yeah, I really would take the idea of you claiming that she a person who I fucking don't deserve to be anywhere near her.

2426
02:42:54,144 --> 02:42:56,890
She's so strong and powerful and amazing.

2427
02:42:57,060 --> 02:43:03,458
To claim that she is your friend Alex Jones is so fucked up.

2428
02:43:03,604 --> 02:43:21,758
I think that one of the central things about what makes this the experience so painful is that you're being like as the parents of this child who was killed, you're being deprived of your ability to experience your life on your own terms.

2429
02:43:21,904 --> 02:43:26,358
Someone else is creating a caricature of you, and it's deeply painful.

2430
02:43:26,454 --> 02:43:28,060
And Alex is doing it again.

2431
02:43:29,050 --> 02:43:30,098
Here's what happened.

2432
02:43:30,184 --> 02:43:40,166
Alex created a diorama and then dropped it around them and trapped it in there for years, and they finally fucking got out of it.

2433
02:43:40,228 --> 02:43:44,174
So Alex is just building a different diorama that he's trying to trap them with.

2434
02:43:44,272 --> 02:43:44,642
Yeah.

2435
02:43:44,716 --> 02:43:48,566
And here's our last clip for our episode for today.

2436
02:43:48,688 --> 02:43:56,226
And I don't know, I have no words for this.

2437
02:43:56,288 --> 02:43:58,050
This is so unacceptable.

2438
02:43:58,430 --> 02:44:00,922
I mean, they are desperate.

2439
02:44:01,006 --> 02:44:05,418
And then a later break, hesley said, hey, buddy, I appreciate you.

2440
02:44:05,444 --> 02:44:06,474
Thanks for admitting my son down.

2441
02:44:06,512 --> 02:44:07,338
I said, yes, sir.

2442
02:44:07,424 --> 02:44:11,598
I tried to reach out and his lawyer went, Get over here.

2443
02:44:11,684 --> 02:44:12,714
Here's the clip right here.

2444
02:44:12,752 --> 02:44:14,566
Talk to him like that's one of the clips.

2445
02:44:14,698 --> 02:44:16,580
Talk to him like a dog.

2446
02:44:17,150 --> 02:44:19,290
So we're reaching out to them.

2447
02:44:19,400 --> 02:44:20,542
We're going to Connecticut.

2448
02:44:20,566 --> 02:44:21,378
We're meeting with them.

2449
02:44:21,464 --> 02:44:23,058
We're supporting what they did.

2450
02:44:23,144 --> 02:44:28,990
We're not going to be kept away from these families, and we're not going to be caught in the CIA New World Order propaganda operations.

2451
02:44:29,050 --> 02:44:31,170
Not Sandy Hook, but the media control.

2452
02:44:31,280 --> 02:44:32,226
Oh, and great job.

2453
02:44:32,288 --> 02:44:35,914
And we're going to stop school shootings too, with the Second Amendment.

2454
02:44:35,962 --> 02:44:36,354
That's right.

2455
02:44:36,392 --> 02:44:37,400
God bless you.

2456
02:44:38,150 --> 02:44:42,082
So obviously when he says we're going to Connecticut, that's about his other trial.

2457
02:44:42,166 --> 02:44:42,486
Yeah.

2458
02:44:42,548 --> 02:44:43,614
The Lafferty case.

2459
02:44:43,712 --> 02:44:44,360
Yeah.

2460
02:44:45,110 --> 02:44:58,280
I think that saying we won't be kept from these families is something that is so wrong.

2461
02:45:00,230 --> 02:45:14,010
Obviously, the way he's trying to portray it is like, me and the families are on the same side and these evil lawyers are trying to keep us apart because of the power that we could have together in this unity and love and all this, which is nonsense.

2462
02:45:14,390 --> 02:45:27,598
But the place where the real world intersects with this bullshit is exactly the same kind of harassing behaviors encouraging those from the audience.

2463
02:45:27,754 --> 02:45:37,350
Because let's say that Scarlet or Neil or some of these other families don't behave in the way that you would expect based on Alex's rhetoric.

2464
02:45:37,850 --> 02:45:39,510
Well, you should go talk to them.

2465
02:45:39,560 --> 02:45:48,934
Why aren't they if you're not allowed to, while these lawyers are keeping them from you? It lends itself towards encouraging harassment.

2466
02:45:49,102 --> 02:45:58,280
And beyond anything that we talk about in terms of the lawsuit this response is.

2467
02:45:58,970 --> 02:46:00,270
I mean, I agree with you.

2468
02:46:00,320 --> 02:46:04,906
As someone who has no legal background at all, I think this should be a cause for another action.

2469
02:46:04,978 --> 02:46:05,214
Yeah.

2470
02:46:05,252 --> 02:46:06,320
Honestly, absolutely.

2471
02:46:08,090 --> 02:46:21,090
I think because for God creating a mountain so big he couldn't move it, leave them the fuck alone on it and then dropping it on Alex's head.

2472
02:46:21,140 --> 02:46:21,740
Yeah.

2473
02:46:22,670 --> 02:46:26,418
Look, I don't want to use the kids terms, but you got to take the L on this one.

2474
02:46:26,444 --> 02:46:27,726
Alex, I got you.

2475
02:46:27,848 --> 02:46:29,526
Just walk away.

2476
02:46:29,708 --> 02:46:31,666
Just leave them alone.

2477
02:46:31,798 --> 02:46:32,238
Yes.

2478
02:46:32,324 --> 02:46:33,502
Just leave them alone.

2479
02:46:33,586 --> 02:46:41,290
I don't know what kind of bullshit game he's doing to try and save face or create the enemy is these lawyers and not the families.

2480
02:46:41,350 --> 02:46:52,770
And now I'm best friends with them, but this is exploitative, it's abusive, it's disgusting, and it's the kind of behavior that lends itself towards his audience.

2481
02:46:53,690 --> 02:46:56,540
Not behaving in ways that you'd want.

2482
02:46:58,310 --> 02:47:01,890
I believe exactly that what he did was what he did.

2483
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:03,610
I believe it wholeheartedly.

2484
02:47:03,730 --> 02:47:05,358
You knew it was going to happen.

2485
02:47:05,504 --> 02:47:07,458
That's exactly how it was going to go.

2486
02:47:07,604 --> 02:47:10,134
It wasn't going to be a, hey, listen, I'm sorry.

2487
02:47:10,172 --> 02:47:12,260
We're never going to talk about Sandy Hook again.

2488
02:47:12,590 --> 02:47:16,186
It wouldn't even have been just a quick one like, hey, listen, judgment.

2489
02:47:16,258 --> 02:47:18,774
Turns out it was better than we hoped for.

2490
02:47:18,932 --> 02:47:21,150
Frankly, I was fucking up.

2491
02:47:21,260 --> 02:47:23,720
Let's not talk about Sandy Hook ever again.

2492
02:47:24,290 --> 02:47:24,982
Honestly.

2493
02:47:25,066 --> 02:47:28,470
I'm putting the words on the board verboten now.

2494
02:47:28,580 --> 02:47:40,962
I am going to actually instead that's a great idea, but instead, what I'm going to do what are you going to do? I am going to go for the challenge mode of life, and I'm going to try and pill the family.

2495
02:47:41,036 --> 02:47:42,966
That is for experienced players only.

2496
02:47:43,028 --> 02:47:44,358
I've been doing this 28 years.

2497
02:47:44,444 --> 02:47:44,826
All right.

2498
02:47:44,888 --> 02:47:47,290
I guess if you want to go with the challenging mode.

2499
02:47:47,350 --> 02:47:48,114
I don't know.

2500
02:47:48,212 --> 02:47:48,762
Yeah.

2501
02:47:48,896 --> 02:47:51,920
I haven't played Dark Souls in a long time, but it's pretty hard.

2502
02:47:52,550 --> 02:47:52,950
Yeah.

2503
02:47:53,000 --> 02:48:00,030
I found this deeply upsetting and offensive, and that is why this is where we break for this episode.

2504
02:48:00,410 --> 02:48:10,638
Because I don't know, I don't know how else to really put a button in stress like that is what Alex did after the compensatory damages were right after.

2505
02:48:10,784 --> 02:48:11,758
And it sucks.

2506
02:48:11,854 --> 02:48:13,342
He'll never learn any lessons.

2507
02:48:13,426 --> 02:48:13,746
No.

2508
02:48:13,808 --> 02:48:14,926
He's a piece of shit.

2509
02:48:15,058 --> 02:48:15,786
We'll be back.

2510
02:48:15,848 --> 02:48:20,958
Indeed we will tomorrow with another episode, part two, wrapping this baby up.

2511
02:48:21,044 --> 02:48:23,394
And also tomorrow, you can find us on the majority report.

2512
02:48:23,432 --> 02:48:24,380
Oh, that's true.

2513
02:48:25,130 --> 02:48:26,494
That will be noon central.

2514
02:48:26,542 --> 02:48:27,018
01:00 PM.

2515
02:48:27,044 --> 02:48:27,690
Eastern.

2516
02:48:28,250 --> 02:48:32,134
Yes, I can't do time math.

2517
02:48:32,182 --> 02:48:33,330
Yeah, I can.

2518
02:48:33,380 --> 02:48:35,480
I don't know why I said I couldn't anyway.

2519
02:48:37,070 --> 02:48:39,618
What are you? Doctor who? Come on, man.

2520
02:48:39,704 --> 02:48:40,410
Tired.

2521
02:48:40,850 --> 02:48:43,170
So we're back, but tell them we have a website.

2522
02:48:43,220 --> 02:48:43,542
We do.

2523
02:48:43,556 --> 02:48:44,490
It's Knowledgebite.com.

2524
02:48:44,540 --> 02:48:45,178
And we're on Twitter.

2525
02:48:45,214 --> 02:48:45,826
We are on Twitter.

2526
02:48:45,838 --> 02:48:47,190
It's at knowledge underscore fight.

2527
02:48:47,300 --> 02:48:48,670
We'll be back, Jordan.

2528
02:48:48,730 --> 02:48:51,934
But until then, I'm neo.

2529
02:48:51,982 --> 02:48:52,498
I'm Leo.

2530
02:48:52,534 --> 02:48:54,030
I'm dzx Clark.

2531
02:48:55,790 --> 02:48:57,738
Dreamy, creamy summer is happening, man.

2532
02:48:57,764 --> 02:48:58,714
Eat some ice cream.

2533
02:48:58,822 --> 02:49:00,970
And now here comes the sex robot.

2534
02:49:01,030 --> 02:49:02,418
Andy and Janzis, you're on the air.

2535
02:49:02,444 --> 02:49:05,638
Thanks for holding, Alex.

2536
02:49:05,674 --> 02:49:06,622
I'm a first time caller.

2537
02:49:06,646 --> 02:49:07,354
I'm a huge fan.

2538
02:49:07,402 --> 02:49:08,040
I love your work.
