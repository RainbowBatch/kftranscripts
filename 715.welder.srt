1
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,470
Not knowledge fights.

2
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,194
Damn, Jordan.

3
00:00:17,242 --> 00:00:20,382
I am sweating knowledgebitecom.

4
00:00:20,456 --> 00:00:21,490
It's time to pray.

5
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,790
I have great respect for Knowledge.

6
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,402
I'm sick of them posing as if they're good guys.

7
00:00:27,476 --> 00:00:27,814
Shang.

8
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:29,180
We are the bad guys.

9
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,718
Hey, everybody, welcome back.

10
00:01:00,744 --> 00:01:01,538
Knowledge, right? I'm Dan.

11
00:01:01,574 --> 00:01:02,066
I'm Jordan.

12
00:01:02,078 --> 00:01:06,926
We're a couple of dudes like to sit around worship at the altar of Celine and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

13
00:01:06,998 --> 00:01:08,014
Oh, indeed we are.

14
00:01:08,052 --> 00:01:08,798
Dan Jordan.

15
00:01:08,834 --> 00:01:11,182
Dan Jordan, quick question for you.

16
00:01:11,376 --> 00:01:12,130
Bright Spot today.

17
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:25,606
My bright spot today? Jordan we are recording this late due to some logistics, and so I can say that my bright spot is that we just got done recording the Majority Report.

18
00:01:25,728 --> 00:01:26,698
I guess it was live.

19
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:33,718
Well, yeah, but yeah, I didn't get a chance to say some gushy things that I might have wanted to.

20
00:01:33,744 --> 00:01:34,320
Sure.

21
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,646
But that show was very important.

22
00:01:39,768 --> 00:02:00,262
I think, early on doing the show, a lot of people ask me, like, how do you stay sane listening to all this? Alex and one of the things that was really critical for me was there is a groundedness to reality in a lot of the interviews that Sam and the Cohosts do with people surrounding, like, some political things and policy issues.

23
00:02:00,396 --> 00:02:08,662
And I found that to be very comforting in the same way that I don't know, my parents listening to and watching, like, the McNeil lair hours when I was a kid.

24
00:02:08,736 --> 00:02:09,926
Well, it's granular.

25
00:02:10,058 --> 00:02:10,426
Yes.

26
00:02:10,488 --> 00:02:11,830
That's what you like.

27
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,546
And it's granular and it's real.

28
00:02:13,608 --> 00:02:13,978
Yes.

29
00:02:14,064 --> 00:02:25,498
Talking about real stuff as opposed to so much of what infowars is right, and then the entertainment value of just like, Sam and Andy Kendler breaking down Dennis Miller shit, it doesn't get better.

30
00:02:25,524 --> 00:02:39,298
Isn't that? And so when we started the show, that was something that was really helpful in terms of keeping me on the level and the notion of being able to be on the show just crazy.

31
00:02:39,384 --> 00:02:40,020
Yeah.

32
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,310
I think that this sneak week has been really bizarre.

33
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:52,774
And no disrespect to CNN or Brian Stelter, but that doesn't compare now.

34
00:02:52,932 --> 00:03:01,642
Being on the Sam and the Majority Report was like, yeah, something not bucket list, but it's something that I'm thrilled about.

35
00:03:01,836 --> 00:03:02,482
Absolutely.

36
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:03,370
It's big.

37
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,278
Anyway, what's your bright spot? My bright spot is first off, obviously that, too.

38
00:03:08,364 --> 00:03:12,874
But second, my mother's in law were great also.

39
00:03:12,912 --> 00:03:14,234
Shout out DJ Danucky.

40
00:03:14,342 --> 00:03:14,974
Oh, my God.

41
00:03:15,012 --> 00:03:15,250
Yes.

42
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,218
Shout out to DJ Danarchy by a million.

43
00:03:17,304 --> 00:03:18,322
Jesus Christ.

44
00:03:18,456 --> 00:03:19,774
I just wanted to interrupt you.

45
00:03:19,812 --> 00:03:23,220
I feel like we say nice things about him all the time and never enough.

46
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:29,974
Yeah, no, they invited their daughter to go to Ireland with him, and then I married her, so they have to take me now, too.

47
00:03:30,012 --> 00:03:32,930
So I am going to Ireland tomorrow.

48
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,694
You'll be here.

49
00:03:33,732 --> 00:03:34,078
Nice.

50
00:03:34,164 --> 00:03:36,466
Yeah, I know.

51
00:03:36,528 --> 00:03:38,374
That the Lucky charms there is.

52
00:03:38,472 --> 00:03:41,258
It tastes better like a Guinness.

53
00:03:41,414 --> 00:03:45,170
It's a lot like wine in Paris.

54
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,694
The Lucky Charms in Ireland, you just don't get them anywhere else.

55
00:03:48,852 --> 00:03:57,886
I was trying to think of something that I would like you to bring me back, and I don't know, I just think of, like, racist things.

56
00:03:57,948 --> 00:04:01,918
No, I was thinking about what I would want.

57
00:04:01,944 --> 00:04:05,030
I would want to go someplace that has, like, the Pete moth.

58
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:05,940
Oh, yeah.

59
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,354
And I don't think you can really bring that back, nor would it be worth it.

60
00:04:10,392 --> 00:04:12,070
I think it's illegal for me to bring that back.

61
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,502
It might be.

62
00:04:12,516 --> 00:04:13,594
You have to declare it.

63
00:04:13,632 --> 00:04:14,302
Yeah.

64
00:04:14,496 --> 00:04:16,238
Which would be an odd thing to declare.

65
00:04:16,334 --> 00:04:18,130
I don't drink that much these days.

66
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:23,890
So like Guinness or whiskey would not really I'll come up with something.

67
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,574
I'll text you.

68
00:04:24,612 --> 00:04:25,582
I'll come up with something.

69
00:04:25,656 --> 00:04:25,894
Okay.

70
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,610
And then I'll text you something.

71
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,150
Probably.

72
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,790
Very thoughtful.

73
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,370
I hope you have a great trip.

74
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:36,898
And that leads us to I haven't really fully decided exactly how we're going to play it yet, exactly.

75
00:04:36,984 --> 00:04:39,838
But you're going to be gone for the next week.

76
00:04:39,924 --> 00:04:47,518
And so our ability to record any episodes is going to be gone, basically reduced to nothing.

77
00:04:47,664 --> 00:04:48,370
Right.

78
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,906
And so I guess if there's a giant emergency, we could, like, Skype in the middle of always.

79
00:04:53,088 --> 00:04:54,430
That is a possibility.

80
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:59,170
And I don't like taking time off, so there's a decent chance I'll come up with something to do.

81
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,958
But temper your expectations.

82
00:05:02,054 --> 00:05:05,782
After sneak week, there may be a creeping away.

83
00:05:05,856 --> 00:05:14,580
Well, I mean, the truth is you need at least some break, and the only way to enforce that is to leave the country.

84
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,926
That doesn't work.

85
00:05:17,988 --> 00:05:18,538
Doesn't work.

86
00:05:18,564 --> 00:05:20,280
But maybe you take a day or two.

87
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,178
But, yeah, there may be one episode next week.

88
00:05:24,204 --> 00:05:27,540
There might actually be none, but we're not entirely sure.

89
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,542
We will see what happens.

90
00:05:29,616 --> 00:05:29,890
Yeah.

91
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:40,740
I mean, there's no way that we put out, like, 12 hours of content in the past seven days that people need time to catch up on.

92
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,410
You picked a good time to go.

93
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,610
Like there's nothing happening.

94
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,380
Yes.

95
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,878
So today we're going to be finishing up the trial recap coverage.

96
00:05:51,974 --> 00:06:00,530
And so what that's going to be is talking about Alex's show on Friday, which is the day when later in the day, the punitive damages would be announced.

97
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,210
Right.

98
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:10,586
And then a bit of the afternoon and a special report Alex put out on Saturday discussing the punitive damages.

99
00:06:10,658 --> 00:06:11,266
Got you.

100
00:06:11,388 --> 00:06:20,760
And because you're going to be gone, I mean, it might be might have to wait a week to find out what he said about the rate on Mar Alko, how under attack we are and how the FBI has got to go.

101
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,180
Don't attack the FBI guys.

102
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,218
I didn't say that.

103
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:27,154
It wasn't me.

104
00:06:27,252 --> 00:06:29,770
Anyway, we'll get down to business on this.

105
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,222
But before we do, Jordan, let's say hello to some new wonk.

106
00:06:32,246 --> 00:06:33,046
Oh, that's a great idea.

107
00:06:33,108 --> 00:06:35,062
So first, Steve, thank you so much.

108
00:06:35,076 --> 00:06:36,398
You are now a policy wonk.

109
00:06:36,494 --> 00:06:37,526
I'm a policy wonk.

110
00:06:37,538 --> 00:06:38,230
Thank you very much.

111
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:38,650
Thank you.

112
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:43,574
Next I like my mind with lettuce and tomato, heinz 57 and French fried potatoes.

113
00:06:43,622 --> 00:06:44,494
Thank you so much.

114
00:06:44,592 --> 00:06:45,310
Boo.

115
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,074
You're now a policy walk.

116
00:06:47,172 --> 00:06:49,226
I'm a policy walker, not a buffet fan.

117
00:06:49,298 --> 00:06:50,146
Thank you very much.

118
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,810
Next drink every time Jordan says right, right.

119
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,494
And diamond alcohol poisoning.

120
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:55,018
Thank you so much.

121
00:06:55,044 --> 00:06:56,258
You're now a policy wonk.

122
00:06:56,354 --> 00:06:57,422
I'm a policy wonk.

123
00:06:57,446 --> 00:06:58,210
Thank you very much.

124
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:58,678
Take it.

125
00:06:58,704 --> 00:06:58,966
Next.

126
00:06:59,028 --> 00:07:02,126
Fuck the horse that gave me a little breaky in my arm.

127
00:07:02,258 --> 00:07:02,842
Thank you so much.

128
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:03,994
You're now policy walk.

129
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:05,102
I'm a policy wonk.

130
00:07:05,126 --> 00:07:05,866
Thank you very much.

131
00:07:05,928 --> 00:07:07,670
Check out next the other Patty.

132
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,394
Not the Patty, the other one.

133
00:07:09,432 --> 00:07:09,982
Thank you so much.

134
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,222
You're now a policy wonk.

135
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:12,302
I'm a policy wonk.

136
00:07:12,326 --> 00:07:13,030
Thank you very much.

137
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,150
Pick out next mike.

138
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:19,286
Knowledge Fight is cathartic for depression, but not as much as UT nuclear reactor aren't.

139
00:07:19,358 --> 00:07:19,918
Thank you so much.

140
00:07:19,944 --> 00:07:21,278
You are now a policy wonk.

141
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,442
I'm a policy wonk.

142
00:07:22,466 --> 00:07:23,170
Thank you very much.

143
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:23,626
Thank you.

144
00:07:23,688 --> 00:07:23,986
Next.

145
00:07:24,048 --> 00:07:25,802
Johnny, this is your dad.

146
00:07:25,886 --> 00:07:27,814
You got to start listening to Knowledge Fight now.

147
00:07:27,852 --> 00:07:29,534
Walk the dog and do your schoolwork.

148
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:30,178
Thank you so much.

149
00:07:30,204 --> 00:07:31,258
You're now a policy walk.

150
00:07:31,344 --> 00:07:32,314
I'm a policy walk.

151
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:33,382
Thank you very much.

152
00:07:33,456 --> 00:07:34,006
Thank you.

153
00:07:34,068 --> 00:07:37,814
And we have something very exciting this weekend.

154
00:07:37,862 --> 00:07:45,622
And we wanted to wish a very heartfelt congratulations to a couple who are getting married and Mr.

155
00:07:45,696 --> 00:07:48,550
Impe getting tie in the old knot.

156
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:55,082
And we want to wish you nothing but years and years, as many as you've got left of happiness.

157
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:56,386
I'm not good at these things.

158
00:07:56,448 --> 00:08:00,638
May all your summers be as dreamy and creamy as the dreamy, creamy summer.

159
00:08:00,674 --> 00:08:01,934
You're practicing for Ireland.

160
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,010
That's what I'm doing.

161
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,594
That's what I'm doing, man.

162
00:08:04,752 --> 00:08:05,760
Well done.

163
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:11,750
From what I understand, MP is a mod on one of the discords.

164
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,590
Okay? And there may be some Wonks at the wedding.

165
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,486
So that is very exciting.

166
00:08:17,558 --> 00:08:18,542
That is exciting.

167
00:08:18,686 --> 00:08:23,162
In honor of that, we would like to declare your wedding a raptor princess.

168
00:08:23,306 --> 00:08:24,494
I'm a policy Wonk.

169
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:25,150
Four star.

170
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,294
Go home to your mother.

171
00:08:26,342 --> 00:08:27,386
Tell her you're brilliant.

172
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:28,774
I'll barbecue your ass.

173
00:08:28,872 --> 00:08:30,302
It's over for humanity.

174
00:08:30,386 --> 00:08:31,334
You're a beautiful soul.

175
00:08:31,382 --> 00:08:32,830
They're coming for your balls.

176
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,400
Well, I piss all over your god.

177
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,654
Very few people crap in the pool unless they're babies.

178
00:08:38,762 --> 00:08:40,078
I piss all over the state.

179
00:08:40,164 --> 00:08:43,786
You make it a practice of calling people pieces of garbage when they are.

180
00:08:43,908 --> 00:08:46,320
Comment as you see fit.

181
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,642
Congratulations.

182
00:08:47,726 --> 00:08:48,610
Congratulations.

183
00:08:49,530 --> 00:09:04,954
So, Jordan, like I said, we're going to get into this in part one of the series, which you put out earlier, we looked at Alex's testimony from the Sandy Hook trial and reviewed his response to the announcement of the compensatory damages which ended up being a little over $4 million.

184
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:06,734
That took us to Thursday afternoon.

185
00:09:06,782 --> 00:09:12,206
And the next day, the trial entered the punitive phase which ended before we entered the weekend.

186
00:09:12,338 --> 00:09:21,778
On this episode, we're going to pick up where we left off and tune into Alex's show the morning of that Friday august 5 and track the response as the reality of the punitive damages sets in.

187
00:09:21,864 --> 00:09:35,146
And he has to wrestle with a very large weight that he is now carrying, both in terms of financial consequences as well as the potential fallout from his texts being accidentally turned over to opposing counsel and what that could mean for his future.

188
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,226
Yeah, not good.

189
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:40,826
Well, I mean, his future if you're approaching it from, like a reality.

190
00:09:40,898 --> 00:09:41,386
Yeah.

191
00:09:41,508 --> 00:09:43,574
But if you're approaching it from Alexand.

192
00:09:43,742 --> 00:09:45,502
Here is how we start the show.

193
00:09:45,576 --> 00:09:46,282
No.

194
00:09:46,476 --> 00:09:50,938
It's Friday, August 5, 2022.

195
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:52,970
I'm Alex Jones, live in studio.

196
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,140
Strap yourselves in.

197
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:46,060
your allegation that government officials that's your dunk are aiding in petrol child trafficking grew Upstein did with her.

198
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,020
Wait, we're doing it twice? Same one.

199
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,820
Love the great meme makers out there.

200
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:57,850
Great job.

201
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,618
Love you all.

202
00:10:58,704 --> 00:10:59,278
Love it.

203
00:10:59,364 --> 00:11:04,334
So this clip that Alex is playing has cut to make it seem like Alex is dropping a truth bomb on the court.

204
00:11:04,382 --> 00:11:09,838
But if you listen to the larger clip or really just Mark's response, it doesn't actually feel that way.

205
00:11:09,864 --> 00:11:19,654
In reality is your allegation that government officials are aiding in pedophile records, child trafficking and the grooming of children.

206
00:11:19,752 --> 00:11:20,400
Right.

207
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:26,014
You mean like what Jeffrey Epstein did with the Clintons? Sure, if that's a yes.

208
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:30,294
Is that a yes? Oh, Jeff.

209
00:11:30,402 --> 00:11:32,526
No one cared that Alex brought up Epstein.

210
00:11:32,598 --> 00:11:37,550
It wasn't a mic drop moment, and honestly, it wasn't even meaningful in the context of the question.

211
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,674
Mark just says, yeah, sure.

212
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:54,914
That was a question about Alex making accusations about the judge in this case being involved in pedophilia and child trafficking, which is conveniently not included in the memes that Alex is playing because it wouldn't support the fun truth telling thing that they were hoping to convey with the memes in the real world.

213
00:11:54,952 --> 00:12:01,758
This question was part of a setup for a trap that Alex walked himself into, which helped impeach him as a credible witness in the trial.

214
00:12:01,914 --> 00:12:06,050
Alex is a painfully unserious person, and this should be a great example of that.

215
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,102
What he said isn't threatening to anyone.

216
00:12:08,176 --> 00:12:13,098
It evoked more rolled eyes than anything else in the courtroom and it was part of a line of questioning.

217
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:21,806
It was pretty effective in demonstrating that Alex was not at all a good faith participant in the trial and that his testimony was not something the jury should be taking at face value.

218
00:12:21,988 --> 00:12:25,358
But it has the appearance of being something that owns the libs or something.

219
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:30,926
So people made memes and Alex decides to start his show with it because that's great.

220
00:12:31,048 --> 00:12:34,494
Yeah, that's sad.

221
00:12:34,602 --> 00:12:43,742
I would want at least more than one clip of a different there wasn't much to go for.

222
00:12:43,816 --> 00:12:44,726
Yeah, exactly.

223
00:12:44,908 --> 00:12:55,406
If you've only got the one clip, that's more sad than if you well, how are you going to make memes out of Alex? Like coughing a bunch and like, oh, you got my phone.

224
00:12:55,588 --> 00:12:56,678
That would be more fun.

225
00:12:56,764 --> 00:12:57,494
I would like that.

226
00:12:57,532 --> 00:13:09,794
Oh, you got my text, didn't you? How about that? Well, it's harder to play that boxing commentary after that because then the messages that Alex is the one who got knocked out, you don't want to convey that it is difficult.

227
00:13:09,892 --> 00:13:17,790
Now, one thing I will say is that this episode involved a bit more news than I expected.

228
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:18,460
Interesting.

229
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:28,660
I mean, there's plenty of navel gazing to go around, naturally, but there are some headlines that Alex covers, and some of them are a little bit fun.

230
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:36,700
Okay, we have the official announcements happening everywhere of shutting off the economy and the cannibalism will now be good.

231
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,278
New York Times, Washington Post.

232
00:13:39,364 --> 00:13:40,550
There's Fegel.

233
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,086
All of it.

234
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:44,018
They are officially saying what I told you two years ago.

235
00:13:44,044 --> 00:13:46,886
They would start saying the cannibalism is good.

236
00:13:47,008 --> 00:13:48,182
Cannibalism is good.

237
00:13:48,256 --> 00:13:49,480
All right, it's about time.

238
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,774
I have been waiting for someone to say cannibalism is good.

239
00:13:53,812 --> 00:14:00,950
So this is just Alex playing fun games with headlines to create the perception that we're on the path to eating each other, which doesn't really make sense.

240
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,778
I thought Claus Schwab wanted us to eat bugs, but now we're supposed to eat each other.

241
00:14:04,864 --> 00:14:06,042
This is dumb.

242
00:14:06,186 --> 00:14:12,210
In the past, we've discussed why cannibalism is inefficient as a diet in all but the most extreme circumstances.

243
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:18,760
The calories expended to kill a person and eat them would likely not be worth what you'd get from it.

244
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,670
And so there's a whole other bunch of issues.

245
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:27,566
Even leaving, like, societal taboos aside, it's not a good plan.

246
00:14:27,628 --> 00:14:29,834
I mean, it's not called the most delicious game.

247
00:14:29,872 --> 00:14:31,466
We're called the Most Dangerous Game.

248
00:14:31,528 --> 00:14:33,830
Right? And that means it's chalice.

249
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:42,954
What's going on is that the show Yellow Jackets is really popular, and that's a show that involves a girl's soccer team who are on a plane that crashes into the wilderness in Canada.

250
00:14:43,062 --> 00:14:47,514
They have to survive for a long time, and apparently Cannibalism is involved in the pilot episode.

251
00:14:47,562 --> 00:14:48,398
It's a really good show.

252
00:14:48,424 --> 00:14:48,986
I watched it.

253
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:52,214
It's kind of like a live, but not really like it at all.

254
00:14:52,252 --> 00:14:59,426
Yeah, the crash in the show happens in 1996, and the show includes tracking the girls who survived in their current lives in 2021.

255
00:14:59,428 --> 00:15:06,786
And it's very heavily implied that their resorting to cannibalism wasn't entirely based on a need to eat human flesh to survive.

256
00:15:06,858 --> 00:15:09,074
Oh, no, there's weird stuff going on.

257
00:15:09,172 --> 00:15:18,470
You've watched it? I'll admit that I haven't, but from the reviews and breakdowns I've read, it seems like it has a little bit of supernatural nonsense and the Lord of the Flies kind of vibe in it.

258
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,462
I would try to discuss the plot more, but that would involve spoilers.

259
00:15:21,486 --> 00:15:26,380
And honestly, from reading it explained, I have no idea what's going on with that show, and I bet you don't either.

260
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:46,766
It's one of those shows where it's like, what if we imply everything and then we'll get a second season and we'll fuck it up then, right? I think it seems like one of those shows that if I hadn't gone along for the entire ride of Lost and then also flash forward many other shows, maybe I would jump in.

261
00:15:46,828 --> 00:15:47,250
Totally.

262
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,518
But I'll wait.

263
00:15:48,604 --> 00:15:53,054
See, I didn't see Lost, I didn't see all these things, so I'm fine with it for now.

264
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:54,222
You haven't been burned.

265
00:15:54,366 --> 00:15:59,058
Next season is going to be garbage and they're going to be like, we're going to explain things and there'll be midichlorians involved.

266
00:15:59,094 --> 00:16:00,374
So maybe not.

267
00:16:00,412 --> 00:16:01,190
You never know.

268
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:17,526
Anyway, in the wake of that show's massive success, it was released on DVD in mid July, so there is renewed conversation about it, including discussion of the coming second season and the cannibalism scene in the first episode that apparently wasn't even explained by the season finale.

269
00:16:17,658 --> 00:16:20,418
People are talking about this show that they're enjoying.

270
00:16:20,454 --> 00:16:32,330
So the New York Times published an oped about a couple of pieces of cannibalism related creative works that have come out recently, seemingly building on the premise that cannibalism is a hot topic in fiction these days.

271
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:43,360
Naturally, the right wing went bad shit over this and created an entire news cycle based on the nonsense idea that the Times was trying to tell people that cannibalism is actually really cool and maybe that you should eat people.

272
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:56,594
Alex is a shallow thinker and a shallower reader, so he's not read this op ed, and I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't even read the full text of the breathlessly, outraged response articles that were written about it.

273
00:16:56,692 --> 00:17:00,806
But if he had read the original thing, he would have read this part towards the end.

274
00:17:00,928 --> 00:17:01,326
Quote.

275
00:17:01,398 --> 00:17:04,662
According to Miss Summers, cannibalism is always symbolic.

276
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:09,530
For her novel's protagonist, eating human flesh can be seen as a way of holding onto a relationship.

277
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,958
That ended for Miss Summers herself.

278
00:17:12,054 --> 00:17:27,842
The plot of a certain hunger can't be uncoupled from, quote, my own personal experiences with disordered eating, with the tamping down of feminine appetites, the way the media chews up and spits out writers, bougie consumption and bougie lady consumption, she said.

279
00:17:27,976 --> 00:17:34,242
More generally, Miss Summers thinks that the recent spate of cannibalistic plots could be commentaries on capitalism.

280
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:39,702
Quote Cannibalism is about consumption, and it's about burning up from the inside in order to exist.

281
00:17:39,846 --> 00:17:45,918
Burnout is essentially over consuming yourself, your own energies, your own will to survive your sleep.

282
00:17:45,954 --> 00:17:48,530
Schedule your eating, schedule your body.

283
00:17:48,700 --> 00:18:01,158
The article is a thoughtful examination of some of these social commentaries that are possibly being made by themes of cannibalism that are being expressed in a very limited set of pieces of media, including a very popular recent series.

284
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:06,078
But of course, for people like Alex, it's secretly the Times telling everyone that eating people is trendy.

285
00:18:06,114 --> 00:18:11,560
Now, this is idiotic kid shit, but it's fun.

286
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,140
At least it's something.

287
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:28,874
Here's the thing for me, I'm trying to imagine what the real world would look like if a positive Cannibalism article was released beyond right wing freak out.

288
00:18:29,032 --> 00:18:40,058
We all live in a world where suddenly the New York Times is like, hey, guess what? We talked to this scientist and he's like, actually, we're super nutritious and when we die, you should eat your grandparents in front of them.

289
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:54,020
What would that look like? A conversation surrounding, hey, a lot of the world does eat insects, and that's not something that is weird to everybody.

290
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,662
It's a cultural thing.

291
00:18:55,736 --> 00:18:56,046
Right.

292
00:18:56,108 --> 00:19:00,982
There are a very efficient source of nutrition and protein.

293
00:19:01,066 --> 00:19:03,702
They can be rebred a million times.

294
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:06,238
Right? Yeah, I understand that conversation.

295
00:19:06,394 --> 00:19:11,542
That conversation would never happen as it relates to human flight.

296
00:19:11,566 --> 00:19:16,320
I couldn't you would put a name on it.

297
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:20,042
You would be like, oh, yeah, so yesterday we ate Grandpa Joe.

298
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:24,034
And then everybody would have to stop for a second, think about themselves.

299
00:19:24,132 --> 00:19:34,102
The only way it would exist in any kind of publication would be in some kind of a swifty and satire kind of yeah, it would have to be.

300
00:19:34,296 --> 00:19:36,780
But yeah, it is funny too.

301
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:42,370
I do appreciate that because it does feel more normal for Alex.

302
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,778
Yeah, that does feel natural.

303
00:19:46,814 --> 00:19:47,400
Yeah.

304
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:52,874
Having been on such a long like I'm a victim.

305
00:19:52,982 --> 00:19:53,326
Right.

306
00:19:53,388 --> 00:19:57,998
It is kind of nice to have a little bit of something else, even if it is entirely stupid.

307
00:19:58,034 --> 00:19:59,038
I will accept that.

308
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:00,466
That was a breath of fresh air.

309
00:20:00,528 --> 00:20:06,038
In a certain sense, it's still rancid, but it was fresher than previous.

310
00:20:06,134 --> 00:20:06,610
Yeah.

311
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,806
So there's some other news down in Florida.

312
00:20:09,878 --> 00:20:13,274
Things are going up, but this is before the rate on Marlowe.

313
00:20:13,322 --> 00:20:15,814
Don't get too excited, okay? We're going to hit that rate.

314
00:20:15,852 --> 00:20:30,960
The huge developments with DeSantis leading the charge, firing, and then having the police go to the offices of soros operatives inside the government so they can't destroy any evidence of them criminally taking orders from the big guy.

315
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,662
This is before Mara Lago got rated.

316
00:20:33,686 --> 00:20:36,034
So this kind of idea is pretty good, right? This is a good thing.

317
00:20:36,072 --> 00:20:36,670
Yeah.

318
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,342
So government figures being rated, it's pretty cool.

319
00:20:40,356 --> 00:20:42,550
I want them to do that because they're corrupt.

320
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:54,074
So this is about DeSantis firing the Hillsborough State Attorney, Andrew Warren, because he refused to prosecute cases regarding trans people and reproductive health care cases.

321
00:20:54,122 --> 00:20:54,478
Right.

322
00:20:54,564 --> 00:21:00,694
The reason this is a big deal and a clear abuse of power is that the state attorney is an elected office can't do it.

323
00:21:00,732 --> 00:21:10,000
And there are processes to remove the person from office, but the governor just sort of dismissing a person.

324
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,210
It's a little bit dicey.

325
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:12,650
Yeah.

326
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:22,240
I mean, it's probably bad if a governor is willing to just risk being a fascist and see if it pays off.

327
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:26,798
That's a bad sign, is when the governor is like, you know what, fuck it.

328
00:21:26,824 --> 00:21:28,302
I bet there's a 50 50 shot.

329
00:21:28,326 --> 00:21:33,902
This one works because I think that he really does this person that people voted in.

330
00:21:33,976 --> 00:21:35,922
Yeah, maybe it doesn't.

331
00:21:35,946 --> 00:21:38,030
And if it works, guess what? I'm dictator now.

332
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,054
I own Florida.

333
00:21:39,102 --> 00:21:41,454
If it works, it opens up a lot of doors.

334
00:21:41,502 --> 00:21:42,954
It opens up a lot of doors.

335
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:43,600
Yeah.

336
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:49,130
So Alex is not going to be hosting the show the whole time today.

337
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,962
And then Mike Adams in studio, always amazing.

338
00:21:52,156 --> 00:21:52,874
Wow.

339
00:21:53,032 --> 00:22:01,190
Coming up in the second hour, and he's going to also have some big guests on with him because I've got to go back down to this kangaroo court.

340
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:11,538
The rest of it, I'll be here for about an hour in 15 minutes and I'll be back this evening as I did last night, shooting special reports and going on the War Room with Owen Schroueer.

341
00:22:11,634 --> 00:22:12,554
Three to 06:00 p.m..

342
00:22:12,592 --> 00:22:14,966
I should be in there during the last hour today.

343
00:22:15,088 --> 00:22:15,338
Yeah.

344
00:22:15,364 --> 00:22:20,042
So Mike Adams is going to come fill in and I'll tell you what, I skipped it.

345
00:22:20,116 --> 00:22:20,714
Yeah.

346
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:22,230
Not listen to the health ranger.

347
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,620
No, don't care.

348
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,574
His throat sounds a lot better.

349
00:22:25,612 --> 00:22:26,894
I'm glad he's feeling better.

350
00:22:26,992 --> 00:22:28,490
He's got 18.

351
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:32,920
It does feel like his throat sounds so much better.

352
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,858
He says he has a cough button and all that.

353
00:22:35,884 --> 00:22:39,220
And I know that he does, but still come on.

354
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,218
Actually, we're going to get to it.

355
00:22:43,244 --> 00:22:43,722
Yeah.

356
00:22:43,856 --> 00:22:47,778
We have an excuse for why it was so bad.

357
00:22:47,864 --> 00:22:48,438
Okay.

358
00:22:48,584 --> 00:22:51,742
And it's great because there was some bad acting.

359
00:22:51,826 --> 00:22:52,974
His excuse is pretty awesome.

360
00:22:53,012 --> 00:22:53,286
Okay.

361
00:22:53,348 --> 00:22:54,510
All right, listen.

362
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:58,138
So like I said, there is still some naval gazing.

363
00:22:58,174 --> 00:23:00,214
There's still some talking about his own victimhood.

364
00:23:00,262 --> 00:23:00,654
Sure.

365
00:23:00,752 --> 00:23:05,430
And it involves Alex actually accusing the judge of criminal behavior.

366
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:09,298
And you're not going to believe what the judge is doing publicly.

367
00:23:09,334 --> 00:23:10,758
She's not even hiding it.

368
00:23:10,904 --> 00:23:12,874
And I believe it's criminal.

369
00:23:13,042 --> 00:23:14,890
I believe it's criminal.

370
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:18,202
But again, this county is run by sorrow, so they're allowed to commit crimes.

371
00:23:18,226 --> 00:23:19,446
We can't even be good people.

372
00:23:19,568 --> 00:23:20,238
Will be right back.

373
00:23:20,264 --> 00:23:20,922
Stay with us.

374
00:23:20,996 --> 00:23:21,234
Yeah.

375
00:23:21,272 --> 00:23:25,038
So the judge is committing crimes in a larger sense.

376
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:29,360
He did speak a real truth, which is that we can't even be good people.

377
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:38,778
Can is you got to parse that he is unable to be a good person.

378
00:23:38,864 --> 00:23:47,494
So I said, but what he's arguing is he's not being allowed to be a person, but if you remove the parts where he's lying, then he's telling the truth.

379
00:23:47,542 --> 00:23:48,294
That's a fair point.

380
00:23:48,332 --> 00:23:48,678
Yes.

381
00:23:48,764 --> 00:23:58,842
So Alex really wants to get into this DeSantis, kicking out this state attorney story, so he even needs to bring in a buddy to ride side car with him.

382
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:12,150
The great work that Santa is doing, literally firing these deep state soros operatives that violate their oath of office and having the state police go to their offices, make sure they don't destroy any evidence of what they've been up to.

383
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,830
He's got them under investigation.

384
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:18,762
Santa just gets better and better because he's actually going after the deep state.

385
00:24:18,896 --> 00:24:22,698
Trump never really did that, but the Santa is doing it.

386
00:24:22,724 --> 00:24:23,754
Trump fought the deep state.

387
00:24:23,792 --> 00:24:28,854
Trump did a lot of things executively, but never actually took sorrow sean head on.

388
00:24:29,012 --> 00:24:34,062
So we got a special guest, pastor Rodney Howard Brown, popping in at the bottom of the hour.

389
00:24:34,256 --> 00:24:37,470
This prosecutor is the one that had him arrested.

390
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:40,762
Now he's been fired by the governor.

391
00:24:40,906 --> 00:24:44,190
So Rodney Howard Brown is going to pop in for a segment or so.

392
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:44,610
Yes.

393
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:52,114
In March 2020, Rodney Howard Brown defied public health guidance and held church services when large public gatherings were restricted.

394
00:24:52,222 --> 00:24:58,738
He was charged with some things like unlawful assembly, but ultimately those charges were dropped and he didn't really face any consequences.

395
00:24:58,894 --> 00:25:00,030
Very oppressed, this guy.

396
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,570
Have fun.

397
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:04,426
He's going to come in and talk shit without nightmare, nightmare.

398
00:25:04,618 --> 00:25:15,466
You know, Trump has given them a taste of fascism, and based on Alex's current comments about an elected official, absolutely wrecking any and all power structures.

399
00:25:15,658 --> 00:25:18,090
I think they want more fascism.

400
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,302
Yeah, you could get some of those indications.

401
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:21,418
I think there's clues.

402
00:25:21,514 --> 00:25:25,482
Yeah, I think that's what that's what I'm picking up on here.

403
00:25:25,676 --> 00:25:35,180
So Alex has lost in the cumulative compensatory phase of the trial a little over $4 million.

404
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,394
He touches on that a little bit.

405
00:25:38,552 --> 00:25:51,346
Let me do this now, because a lot of people are tuning in to the show, wanting to get my response to the $4.1 million judgment by an Austin jury yesterday.

406
00:25:51,478 --> 00:25:53,046
I shot a video last night.

407
00:25:53,168 --> 00:26:02,802
It's a band out video where I lay out in about five minutes my stance on it and where I stand, but I'll do that again.

408
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,014
Bribe is tuned in live.

409
00:26:04,052 --> 00:26:13,990
I know a lot of you are tuning in, their new viewers wanting to get my view, but there's last night's announcement breaking exclusive alex Jones response to 4.2 million Sandy Hook verdict.

410
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,622
628,000 views.

411
00:26:15,706 --> 00:26:18,440
You want to go see it? It's a very important video.

412
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:19,770
So important.

413
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:37,914
But let me just briefly chronicle what's been happening in the last week and a half now, almost two weeks as of today in this kangaroo court and how it's the model for the rest of the country and the world, and then how George Soros and the operatives are literally coordinating and running this.

414
00:26:38,012 --> 00:26:41,710
Oh, man, that's quite a scoop.

415
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,854
I would not have said that.

416
00:26:44,012 --> 00:26:45,234
I wouldn't have said that.

417
00:26:45,332 --> 00:26:47,060
Why not? That's just me.

418
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,442
And here's why I wouldn't have said it.

419
00:26:50,456 --> 00:26:51,546
Because you're not fun.

420
00:26:51,668 --> 00:26:52,340
Right.

421
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:56,254
It's not so much the jury now or the judge.

422
00:26:56,362 --> 00:26:59,262
It's more the sanctions that are coming.

423
00:26:59,396 --> 00:27:00,080
Sure.

424
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,510
But also.

425
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:10,594
You're really casting your bet on the other trials aren't going to happen if you're Alex.

426
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:13,330
Because some of this post trial behavior.

427
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:16,518
I could easily see it being introduced as like.

428
00:27:16,604 --> 00:27:17,106
Look.

429
00:27:17,228 --> 00:27:19,054
How do you not in the way that he behaves.

430
00:27:19,102 --> 00:27:20,670
How do you not I mean.

431
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,474
In another punitive hearing.

432
00:27:22,522 --> 00:27:23,370
How do you not go.

433
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:23,886
Okay.

434
00:27:24,008 --> 00:27:25,582
We did one punitive hearing.

435
00:27:25,666 --> 00:27:28,398
And this was supposed to get him to stop doing this.

436
00:27:28,484 --> 00:27:29,814
So here's what he said.

437
00:27:29,972 --> 00:27:37,038
Hours later, he decided that he was going to imply that he will not be kept away from the Sandy Hook family.

438
00:27:37,124 --> 00:27:37,590
Please.

439
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,546
And then accused the judge of criminal behavior.

440
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:44,574
Punitive damages doesn't even begin to describe what needs happening.

441
00:27:44,732 --> 00:27:49,194
So the media in on it? The judge in on it, of course.

442
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,678
Soros operatives unnamed, right.

443
00:27:51,704 --> 00:27:52,842
But definitely in on it.

444
00:27:52,856 --> 00:27:53,370
Of course.

445
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,182
The corporate media that's in the courtroom are all coordinating.

446
00:27:56,326 --> 00:27:58,460
The judge is coordinating with the media.

447
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:05,780
The judge is altering the record of the trial, in my view, and I'll explain that in a moment by recording it.

448
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:13,050
She didn't just say I'm guilty until the jury more than 20 times, I'm guilty, and that they had to find me guilty.

449
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,118
You're not allowed to find him innocent.

450
00:28:15,214 --> 00:28:16,102
I found him guilty.

451
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:28,786
she barred us from being able to respond in the punitive damages phase to our net worth.

452
00:28:28,848 --> 00:28:34,618
Now we turned over to them an accurate net worth at machine defaulted us.

453
00:28:34,704 --> 00:28:36,194
I spent days up here with lawyers.

454
00:28:36,242 --> 00:28:42,922
They got all the numbers, looked at my personal money, everything, gave them a complete list under court order.

455
00:28:42,996 --> 00:28:47,760
Did they? And I knew it was all rigged, but I wanted to show the world this.

456
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:54,374
And then instead, they barred us from argument or calling any witnesses.

457
00:28:54,422 --> 00:29:05,350
We could only cross examine their expert, who literally is some dandruff covered guy that looks like he has a gray wig on, stumbles around.

458
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,654
He has a name, like first and Howell the 7th or something.

459
00:29:07,692 --> 00:29:08,678
I'm not joking.

460
00:29:08,834 --> 00:29:10,510
He has like five names.

461
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:13,514
He was great.

462
00:29:13,552 --> 00:29:14,942
I got to find his name in the news.

463
00:29:15,076 --> 00:29:16,638
Yeah, that is my new alias.

464
00:29:16,674 --> 00:29:19,670
Yeah, Wilford Snipel.

465
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,214
Can't argue with that.

466
00:29:23,252 --> 00:29:23,934
That's a good one.

467
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:25,294
His name is Bernard Pettigil.

468
00:29:25,342 --> 00:29:30,080
Yeah, it's the Pettigiel part that makes you just think of it.

469
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,478
Snapper people.

470
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:36,860
It sounds like that name is missing an Esquire after it, though.

471
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:37,878
Yeah.

472
00:29:37,964 --> 00:29:39,714
You know what I'm saying? You can hear it.

473
00:29:39,812 --> 00:29:40,842
Yeah, you can hear it.

474
00:29:40,916 --> 00:29:42,922
But isn't esquire for lawyers.

475
00:29:43,066 --> 00:29:44,214
Something like that.

476
00:29:44,372 --> 00:29:47,326
Shouldn't be rain all esquire.

477
00:29:47,398 --> 00:29:52,700
Yeah, but he wouldn't be an Esquire of the great Grimm Pivot family.

478
00:29:54,110 --> 00:30:04,966
Oh, do you mean the Brooklyn Grivel pivbles? I am Dead snivel Sample God damn, that's good.

479
00:30:05,028 --> 00:30:05,602
Oh, man.

480
00:30:05,676 --> 00:30:06,480
Good stuff.

481
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,038
It's? No.

482
00:30:08,184 --> 00:30:09,850
Stratford upon Avon.

483
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:19,366
And it also distracts you from the nonsense that he was saying earlier in that clip where he's talking about the judge falsifying the record or whatever.

484
00:30:19,488 --> 00:30:22,610
And so I was kind of interested to hear what that meant.

485
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:24,946
And here's what he was talking about.

486
00:30:25,128 --> 00:30:37,006
I was here yesterday, running around the office trying to watch the verdict, and she was killing the stream every five minutes or so because she said she would live stream it.

487
00:30:37,128 --> 00:30:42,206
But we kicked their butts so bad, even though we had our hands tied behind our backs, that she killed the stream.

488
00:30:42,278 --> 00:30:50,674
During most of my testimony, So that Law and Crime can only put out edited clips of me where I go, oh, that's a Perry Mason moment.

489
00:30:50,772 --> 00:30:52,006
Except it's not.

490
00:30:52,188 --> 00:30:55,138
Those text messages all come from me on my phone.

491
00:30:55,224 --> 00:31:03,238
I gave it to all the lawyers as I testified, and now you have it proving I told you the damn truth and you guys just act like you didn't have it all.

492
00:31:03,264 --> 00:31:04,174
We've got his phone.

493
00:31:04,272 --> 00:31:05,314
We got his phone.

494
00:31:05,412 --> 00:31:06,514
Let's give it to him.

495
00:31:06,612 --> 00:31:21,146
The most generous explanation for this is that Alex is an idiot and doesn't understand that Long Crimes YouTube channel posted the long form videos of the trial and also published shorter snippets of particularly exciting moments, like when his text messages were revealed.

496
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:32,546
Alex doesn't deserve a generous interpretation, and the reality here is that he's just lying to make his audience think that the judge in this case shut down the feed and only allowed these shorter clips to go out, which is nonsense.

497
00:31:32,678 --> 00:31:38,350
It's likely too late for it to matter, but I have to assume that this could constitute some kind of contempt of court type thing.

498
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,946
He's literally accusing the judge of crimes.

499
00:31:41,018 --> 00:31:48,446
Yeah, I mean, they still have to work out the exact sanctions for both Renault and Alex.

500
00:31:48,638 --> 00:31:50,700
That is still in the air.

501
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:58,690
It's not like they wrote down a number and they handed it to Alex and they were like, okay, you can keep being a piece of shit, but you're also going to owe us this.

502
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,382
They're still doing that.

503
00:32:00,576 --> 00:32:17,162
I both watched a fair amount of feed and was there in person, and I can say with quite a bit of confidence that Alex was not kicking their ass so bad, even with his hands tied behind his back, that they would need to shut down the feed.

504
00:32:17,246 --> 00:32:25,022
Also, the Law and Crime feed is not the same thing as the courts feed, which Alex is intentionally confusing.

505
00:32:25,106 --> 00:32:31,210
And that's fine, it's meaningless, but he does stress this quite a bit.

506
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,326
So here's what I believe is illegal.

507
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:36,574
If the judge is going to let something be televised televise, it real.

508
00:32:36,612 --> 00:32:46,090
Courts that they do it have a pool camera or two cameras that aim at whoever's speaking and when the judge speaks.

509
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:48,410
Instead, there's just dozens of cameras.

510
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:53,134
But they're all pet media and they all are on the same script and all put the same clips out, basically.

511
00:32:53,292 --> 00:33:00,360
And the judge sits there while she controls the YouTube stream, turning it on and turning it off and turning it on and turning it off.

512
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,886
She got a little stream.

513
00:33:01,958 --> 00:33:03,098
She just kills the stream.

514
00:33:03,134 --> 00:33:05,398
She's up there like a DJ running it.

515
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:09,398
So either you're going to show people the trial or don't.

516
00:33:09,434 --> 00:33:14,774
But I think it's illegal to claim something is televised and then only let out certain parts of the trial.

517
00:33:14,822 --> 00:33:29,474
But when something you don't like happened, you kill the stream and then turn it back on to the other side speaking and then Bankston, their main lawyer, gets up, the plaintiff's lawyer, the ambulance chaser, and goes, listen, Judge, I want you to not kill the stream during this part because I'm an exposed at law enforcement.

518
00:33:29,522 --> 00:33:35,818
Hat wants Jones's phone, and he's going down, and it's January 6 and all this stuff, and none of that's even true.

519
00:33:35,844 --> 00:33:39,238
She's like, okay, I'll keep it screaming, but when my lawyer talks, she turns it off.

520
00:33:39,324 --> 00:33:40,198
None of this happened.

521
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:41,278
None of it.

522
00:33:41,364 --> 00:33:42,706
Not even a little bit.

523
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:44,110
This is wild.

524
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:49,042
It's just a manufactured narrative of what happened.

525
00:33:49,176 --> 00:33:52,358
It is so convenient.

526
00:33:52,514 --> 00:34:02,674
Shouldn't it be too convenient now for even his listeners that everything that proves he's innocent is unable to be found? But it's not.

527
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:03,478
Of course not.

528
00:34:03,504 --> 00:34:09,706
They're not going to go and look and find the feed, like the full six hour videos on there.

529
00:34:09,828 --> 00:34:11,086
On there.

530
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:25,154
There's no way that you could I mean, even that how do you think I pulled the clips for our lawn? Except also, what judge knows how to competently turn the stream on and off? Like Alex's cough button? Just a little foot pedal.

531
00:34:25,202 --> 00:34:25,486
Yeah.

532
00:34:25,548 --> 00:34:31,142
No, I mean, his lawyer couldn't even figure out how to use a fucking 8th grade projector.

533
00:34:31,226 --> 00:34:35,458
No, I think I have notes about this later to bring up.

534
00:34:35,484 --> 00:34:40,990
But we were there in the courtroom and the law and crime.

535
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:51,960
Their camera person was sitting next to us through a lot of the time during the trial, and they would be fixing things sometimes.

536
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:57,238
So there was, like, problems that they had with their stream and their video.

537
00:34:57,384 --> 00:35:01,990
And there was at least one occasion where I remember that they came in late.

538
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:09,090
That is a separate entire feed from the zoom from the court.

539
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:18,914
Yeah, there was literally a moment where the battery got down to like, 3% because somebody had jostled their cord and it popped out.

540
00:35:18,952 --> 00:35:19,994
Like, you don't know.

541
00:35:20,152 --> 00:35:25,840
This is just a boring defense for Alex, but I think it's what he wants to go full on with it.

542
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:28,814
But it is what you're talking about.

543
00:35:28,912 --> 00:35:31,638
It is that dynamic of appealing to the unknown.

544
00:35:31,734 --> 00:35:37,142
It's like there's this other stuff somewhere that proves that I'm innocent, but you can never find it.

545
00:35:37,156 --> 00:35:38,462
You'll never be able to find it.

546
00:35:38,476 --> 00:35:40,290
And it's not because it doesn't exist.

547
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:43,730
It's because this evil judge, she's so evil.

548
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:51,446
So Alex certainly pissed off about being jammed up in this trial, but he's got to get to the news.

549
00:35:51,628 --> 00:35:55,266
I promise you I'm going to get into world news for the rest of this broadcast.

550
00:35:55,338 --> 00:36:10,458
We got so many special guests in the studio, but I got to finish up because they just gave me transcripts and tweets of what's going on down at the kangaroo courthouse there where I've been railroaded in the second phase of the damages.

551
00:36:10,554 --> 00:36:12,110
I guess we're not getting to the news.

552
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,778
I guess we're going to do this for longer.

553
00:36:13,864 --> 00:36:14,438
Yeah.

554
00:36:14,584 --> 00:36:16,840
Anyway, at least it's kind of fun.

555
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:22,122
I told you the guy had a name like Thurston Howell III, but they didn't say his two middle names.

556
00:36:22,206 --> 00:36:23,262
He set it on the stands.

557
00:36:23,286 --> 00:36:24,266
I was there this morning.

558
00:36:24,388 --> 00:36:25,730
It's Bernard.

559
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:32,410
And he goes like, Banaj Ninju papolis gubertomondius.

560
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:33,630
Petty gillis.

561
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,042
I couldn't believe when he said his name.

562
00:36:36,116 --> 00:36:37,198
Wilford Snipple.

563
00:36:37,234 --> 00:36:38,698
Snapper of the gribber pibro.

564
00:36:38,734 --> 00:36:40,714
Did he say? Gutter to mondia.

565
00:36:40,822 --> 00:36:41,480
No.

566
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:44,214
You could go and find him being sworn in.

567
00:36:44,252 --> 00:36:47,190
He says his name is Bernard Francis Petigill Jr.

568
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,598
I don't remember.

569
00:36:50,684 --> 00:36:54,826
Gucci demoninus the group of people.

570
00:36:54,888 --> 00:36:56,222
I'm not even Ozzy.

571
00:36:56,246 --> 00:36:57,074
Man davis.

572
00:36:57,182 --> 00:36:57,994
No, none of it.

573
00:36:58,032 --> 00:36:59,278
I can't stop saying that.

574
00:36:59,304 --> 00:37:00,166
It's so good.

575
00:37:00,228 --> 00:37:00,986
Gribble pebble.

576
00:37:01,058 --> 00:37:01,680
Yeah.

577
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:06,960
So this is quite a conspiracy that Alex has got cooking here.

578
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,490
It's sprawling.

579
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:13,970
Are there a lot of players in the game now? So many.

580
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:27,342
The judge told all the news cameras, I've authorized all of you to be here, but no one else is allowed to film, and if you do, I'll have you arrested, and stuff like that.

581
00:37:27,416 --> 00:37:33,920
She's on tape, and then whenever we speak, she cuts us off on YouTube and then lets them speak.

582
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:37,734
So they can then have the news crews edit down.

583
00:37:37,832 --> 00:37:42,562
And they're coordinating because they put out different camera shots, but down to the same sections.

584
00:37:42,646 --> 00:37:44,526
So somebody picks the time.

585
00:37:44,648 --> 00:37:48,546
They got these directors back there talking to all the cameras, and then they put out what they want.

586
00:37:48,668 --> 00:37:49,362
Here's an example.

587
00:37:49,436 --> 00:37:51,190
Everybody told me about it on YouTube.

588
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:59,226
You'll have ten to one comments for me, and all of a sudden they all get pushed down and deleted, and a bunch of hateful comments get put to the top.

589
00:37:59,348 --> 00:38:04,434
It'll have like five upvotes one with 10 up votes is removed or pushed to the bottom.

590
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:11,574
Let's take a step back and try to forget that we're listening to a celebrity racist demagogue here and really listen to what they're saying.

591
00:38:11,732 --> 00:38:17,458
If anyone you knew was talking like this about how everyone was out to get them, you'd rightly understand that they aren't.

592
00:38:17,494 --> 00:38:21,034
Well, but for Alex, it's just kind of his shtick.

593
00:38:21,142 --> 00:38:28,446
He sounds like someone raving about black helicopters, because he's literally the same person who was raving about black helicopters 20 years ago.

594
00:38:28,568 --> 00:38:37,018
He's delusional, and he's found enough people to enable and reinforce his delusions that he's been able to make it profitable and insulate himself from any consequences of his actions.

595
00:38:37,174 --> 00:38:39,178
But this just sounds dumb.

596
00:38:39,334 --> 00:38:47,482
Alex is getting on his show to complain about how unfairly he's being treated, which is evidenced by a completely inaccurate description of how the live streams are broadcast.

597
00:38:47,626 --> 00:38:55,738
Then he's heard from other people that there's a conspiracy about silencing supportive YouTube comments, which is just pathetic.

598
00:38:55,894 --> 00:38:57,754
Alex isn't even able to make this claim.

599
00:38:57,802 --> 00:39:01,194
He has to say that other people have told him this is happening.

600
00:39:01,352 --> 00:39:06,514
He has literally no idea if this is real at all, but it feeds into his victimhood status.

601
00:39:06,562 --> 00:39:18,790
So not only is it real, it's also probably way worse than it seems and it's being directed by the judge in coordination with soros on the live streams, commenting was disabled for obvious reasons.

602
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:26,370
As far as the law and crime videos are concerned, you can go to those and still see a ton of pro Alex comments, mostly in the live chat.

603
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:29,502
It's silly to think that YouTube comments mean anything.

604
00:39:29,636 --> 00:39:34,614
A lot of them are bots, many of them are people just trolling and there are plenty that just don't even make sense.

605
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:43,830
It's really sad to see a 48 year old adult whining on his show about how he's heard that there aren't enough positive comments about him on some YouTube video.

606
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,362
So it must be a censorship conspiracy issue.

607
00:39:46,496 --> 00:39:47,398
It's nonsense.

608
00:39:47,434 --> 00:39:48,442
It's just pathetic.

609
00:39:48,526 --> 00:39:52,942
Yeah, I really thought we were done with allowing people to bitch about YouTube comments.

610
00:39:53,086 --> 00:39:54,402
I just thought that was done.

611
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:57,498
I'm done with allowing it to mean anything.

612
00:39:57,584 --> 00:39:58,220
Right.

613
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:03,078
It speaks volumes about you if you're complaining about it.

614
00:40:03,224 --> 00:40:09,862
It's been in movies from 2015 where it's like, hey, don't read the comments on the YouTube.

615
00:40:09,946 --> 00:40:12,162
Everybody just knows that it's a horrible place.

616
00:40:12,236 --> 00:40:12,762
Right.

617
00:40:12,896 --> 00:40:20,542
I think that there is still something of a conversation in terms of like abusive and directed abuse and harassment and stuff totally.

618
00:40:20,566 --> 00:40:23,598
That does still exist with comments and what have you.

619
00:40:23,624 --> 00:40:25,786
Of course, trying to argue.

620
00:40:25,918 --> 00:40:28,230
It just goes back to the shadow banny stuff.

621
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,414
It's like, oh, my tweets aren't getting enough.

622
00:40:30,452 --> 00:40:32,938
Likes I must be hidden by the shadow ban.

623
00:40:32,974 --> 00:40:35,430
It must be too dangerous to the establishment or whatever.

624
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,894
And this is just that.

625
00:40:36,992 --> 00:40:41,574
Yeah, the concept of maybe I'm uninteresting is just a nasty positive people.

626
00:40:41,612 --> 00:40:46,638
Yeah, because he's got wilford against him.

627
00:40:46,664 --> 00:40:51,906
How could he be boring? So anyway, yeah, the judge this is a cover up, man.

628
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:53,046
You got a cover up.

629
00:40:53,108 --> 00:40:54,454
And she's deeply involved.

630
00:40:54,502 --> 00:41:01,830
Okay, so the judge is in live time manipulating what the world can see so they can edit it to make me look bad.

631
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:06,802
So I'm asking all the listeners, they don't want you to look at the last week and a half of the trial.

632
00:41:06,886 --> 00:41:07,578
They don't want you.

633
00:41:07,604 --> 00:41:09,190
But there's copies all over the internet.

634
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:12,618
People are now figuring out, she's doing this without us ever asking.

635
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:24,382
And now everybody's going and finding it and going and finding what they weren't supposed to have because there were several other groups they're streaming that didn't completely coordinate.

636
00:41:24,406 --> 00:41:25,794
So copies are out there.

637
00:41:25,892 --> 00:41:28,594
If anybody else was recording, they were committing a crime.

638
00:41:28,702 --> 00:41:30,990
And I don't think so.

639
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:40,042
Based on my experience of being there in the courtroom, I don't think that was happening for a couple of reasons.

640
00:41:40,126 --> 00:41:59,806
There were only a few actual cameras and you had people like the lawn crime folks, you had the HBO documentary, right? And you also had a fair amount of security, like bailiffs and sheriff's officers or whatever, court officers.

641
00:41:59,938 --> 00:42:04,926
And if someone was recording and they didn't have permission that would have been shut down.

642
00:42:04,988 --> 00:42:05,322
Yeah.

643
00:42:05,396 --> 00:42:06,570
Almost instantly.

644
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:11,302
I couldn't stop myself from laughing a couple of times, and I got a visit.

645
00:42:11,386 --> 00:42:12,020
Yeah.

646
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:17,410
Looking around the courtroom, it wasn't packed.

647
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:19,400
There weren't a bunch of people there.

648
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:24,238
I don't think there were people who were like, bootlegging.

649
00:42:24,274 --> 00:42:31,962
The trial part of it is just it really wouldn't have made sense to fit more cameras in there.

650
00:42:32,036 --> 00:42:33,346
No, it would have been pointless.

651
00:42:33,418 --> 00:42:34,594
It wasn't a big courtroom.

652
00:42:34,642 --> 00:42:37,340
It wasn't that big, and there weren't that many people there.

653
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:39,414
Yeah.

654
00:42:39,452 --> 00:42:43,098
And I think they knew it would be interesting and people would watch it.

655
00:42:43,124 --> 00:42:45,882
I don't think they thought it would be that big of a deal.

656
00:42:45,956 --> 00:42:49,878
Well, the court zoom was airing the entire thing.

657
00:42:50,024 --> 00:43:03,322
The law and crime had a slightly better camera, and they were streaming most of it with some limitations of just their whatever was going on, whatever they were doing, and then the HBO camera.

658
00:43:03,406 --> 00:43:09,034
I think there were maybe two leads to get better shots for the documentary.

659
00:43:09,082 --> 00:43:09,680
Yeah.

660
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:11,310
I don't know.

661
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:15,270
Anyway, I think Alex should have to face the judge and answer for this behavior on air.

662
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:24,682
He's basically creating a large target on her by fabricating a conspiracy that the video in the courtroom was being manipulated, and this is just completely unacceptable behavior.

663
00:43:24,766 --> 00:43:25,014
Yeah.

664
00:43:25,052 --> 00:43:36,810
If I was in the middle of being sued and about to get a huge judgment for defaming somebody, I would not, in the same time period, want to sick people on the judge of that case.

665
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,166
Well, I mean, like, just me.

666
00:43:38,228 --> 00:43:41,790
But that's kind of what he did when Roger Stone was on trial.

667
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:43,218
I don't know.

668
00:43:43,244 --> 00:43:46,062
It seems like just behavior that he can't stop himself from doing it.

669
00:43:46,076 --> 00:43:48,560
I mean, he's already put a million dollar bounty on her.

670
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:50,154
That's right.

671
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:51,754
That was the lawyer in Connecticut.

672
00:43:51,802 --> 00:43:52,400
Right.

673
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:53,838
But yeah.

674
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:55,246
Hey, it's not only the judge.

675
00:43:55,318 --> 00:43:56,638
It's also the lawyers.

676
00:43:56,734 --> 00:44:02,842
Everyone's against Alex, and people are recording it while it's streamed now, but noticing they've gotten desperate.

677
00:44:02,866 --> 00:44:07,040
So now she's cutting it off up to three or four times every ten minutes.

678
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:14,120
What? When? Why? I guess she gets a signal because they're actually signaling each other.

679
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:18,642
Their head lawyer gets up and says, now don't cut the feed for the next ten minutes, okay.

680
00:44:18,776 --> 00:44:23,922
And then he goes up and says, Jones perjured himself, the Justice Department, everything else.

681
00:44:23,996 --> 00:44:26,454
We got his whole phone, which they don't, all this stuff.

682
00:44:26,492 --> 00:44:29,422
And then it's like, okay, her honor.

683
00:44:29,446 --> 00:44:30,990
And she's, like, cuts the feed.

684
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:34,230
This is total coordination.

685
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:38,300
I don't think that this is okay.

686
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:42,382
This is a pretty serious accusation that Alex is making, all things considered.

687
00:44:42,406 --> 00:44:47,842
I mean, I know that ultimately most right thinking people know that he's full of shit.

688
00:44:47,926 --> 00:44:48,654
Doesn't mean anything.

689
00:44:48,692 --> 00:44:49,950
He lives in topsy turvy world.

690
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:50,322
Right.

691
00:44:50,396 --> 00:45:00,380
But there are real dangers that you could be putting people in by making accusations like this, and you just can't do this.

692
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:07,590
You can't accuse people of criminal behavior and criminal coordination between a judge and lawyers.

693
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:09,246
I don't know.

694
00:45:09,308 --> 00:45:16,280
Yeah, at least just monsters come out of topsy turvy world to attack people.

695
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:18,654
Alex lives in topsy turvy world.

696
00:45:18,692 --> 00:45:22,640
So we look at it and we're like, hey, listen, you sound like an absolute nut job.

697
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:28,566
But he's sending people and he's putting targets on people that are being sent.

698
00:45:28,688 --> 00:45:29,502
That's crazy.

699
00:45:29,636 --> 00:45:30,006
Yeah.

700
00:45:30,068 --> 00:45:31,014
It's not okay.

701
00:45:31,112 --> 00:45:31,926
It's not okay.

702
00:45:31,988 --> 00:45:32,178
Wow.

703
00:45:32,204 --> 00:45:35,660
This behavior, there has to be some sort of a check on it.

704
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:46,362
But look, hey, Alex has got to get to the news, and honestly, this case is meant to distract him from this large work that is so important that he needs to do.

705
00:45:46,436 --> 00:45:54,740
Okay? They're trying to distract me from my work, but they're not going to distract me from my work.

706
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,038
And that's why I'm not down there.

707
00:45:59,064 --> 00:46:16,020
At the second phase of the trial today, okay, is because no matter what the globalists do, well, I'm still breathing air, or while I'm not locked up in a prison, I am going to be fighting these people.

708
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:17,806
It's that simple.

709
00:46:17,868 --> 00:46:20,040
But I can't stand the fight without you.

710
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:22,262
So they want me to talk about their attacks.

711
00:46:22,286 --> 00:46:24,778
They want me to get diverted into defending myself.

712
00:46:24,864 --> 00:46:30,214
But you understand, we're going to stay in the attack and we're not going to let them distract us.

713
00:46:30,252 --> 00:46:36,190
So what is it that they're trying to distract us from? Well, there's this stack.

714
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:39,422
It's the stacky.

715
00:46:39,566 --> 00:46:43,440
It all comes back to the stackies that they're trying to distract us with.

716
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:53,200
They're trying to distract us from knowing about what I'm about to cover.

717
00:46:54,790 --> 00:47:08,454
And so I'll be back today in the fourth hour, and I'm going to co host with Robert Barnes back today, co hosting some in the war room, because I'm not going to let them silence.

718
00:47:08,502 --> 00:47:09,330
I said tomorrow.

719
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:14,330
I'm going to be here most of the day, even though my five year old daughter is begging me to take her fishing.

720
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:17,018
She has no future if I don't do this.

721
00:47:17,044 --> 00:47:18,014
So I'll be here.

722
00:47:18,172 --> 00:47:19,122
And I'm not a martyr.

723
00:47:19,146 --> 00:47:19,722
I'm not a victim.

724
00:47:19,746 --> 00:47:25,550
I'm saying that I'm going to work harder because they're trying to silence us, because I know it's our mission.

725
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:35,282
And when I get tired and think it must be somebody else's job to do this, when I see it bearing fruit what we've done together, I realize I've got a fight now hard I ever had.

726
00:47:35,356 --> 00:47:39,198
So I'll cover this more in the fourth hour after Mike atoms takes over with some special guests.

727
00:47:39,294 --> 00:47:40,694
Thinks he's got lined up that are huge.

728
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:41,870
People are really excited.

729
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:45,640
Let me just hit these headlines so you know what's coming up.

730
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:47,642
These all tied together.

731
00:47:47,776 --> 00:47:55,686
I hate that every time the globalists are really acting up and duty calls.

732
00:47:55,878 --> 00:48:00,698
The real thing that ends up happening is that Alex's daughter doesn't get to do something fun.

733
00:48:00,784 --> 00:48:01,406
It is.

734
00:48:01,528 --> 00:48:05,606
How many times has he not taken her fishing? It's so many times.

735
00:48:05,728 --> 00:48:06,302
Yeah.

736
00:48:06,436 --> 00:48:10,938
Don't tell me about how you need to take your daughter fishing when you haven't.

737
00:48:11,034 --> 00:48:12,314
That's sad for me.

738
00:48:12,352 --> 00:48:12,518
Yeah.

739
00:48:12,544 --> 00:48:15,918
There's a theme of like, I got to fight these globalists.

740
00:48:15,954 --> 00:48:17,598
I was going to take my daughter fishing.

741
00:48:17,754 --> 00:48:23,558
Can you imagine her sitting at home with a fishing pole? He said he was going to come today.

742
00:48:23,644 --> 00:48:24,650
Yeah, absolutely.

743
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:32,162
No, this is a wilful recontextualizing your neglectful parenting as here's the good news.

744
00:48:32,236 --> 00:48:34,358
What's the good news? That plan didn't exist to begin with.

745
00:48:34,384 --> 00:48:35,538
There was no fishing trip.

746
00:48:35,634 --> 00:48:36,410
That's true.

747
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:38,694
That is all just dramatization.

748
00:48:38,802 --> 00:48:39,146
Yeah.

749
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:47,654
Anyway, Alex is going to do a fun run of headlines and so I decided he's like, these are all connected and this is what the globalist to try and stop us.

750
00:48:47,692 --> 00:48:48,146
Sure.

751
00:48:48,268 --> 00:48:51,770
So we're going to go on this run with him and see what happens.

752
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:52,274
Let's go.

753
00:48:52,312 --> 00:48:53,706
So here's the first headline.

754
00:48:53,838 --> 00:48:55,120
These all tied together.

755
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:59,378
Swedish scientists advocates eating humans to combat climate change.

756
00:48:59,464 --> 00:49:02,090
It's all over the news how's that was coming.

757
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:03,530
Swede Eat people.

758
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:10,574
So this is a headline from 2019, which Alex doesn't know because his team just Googled cannibalism and printed out everything they could find.

759
00:49:10,612 --> 00:49:11,666
That seems like it could work.

760
00:49:11,728 --> 00:49:12,102
Ouch.

761
00:49:12,186 --> 00:49:16,874
Alex does not prep for this show, so he's cold reading headlines, just making up context for them.

762
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:19,694
And in this case, he's pretending that it's a current story.

763
00:49:19,852 --> 00:49:27,770
This was about Magnus Soderland, who went on Swedish TV and was interviewed about some research he was doing into social taboos about food sources.

764
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:33,410
Basically, human meat was used as an extreme example of something that pretty much everyone considered past the line.

765
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:39,350
But where exactly was the line? Lab grown beef, artificial meat, insects.

766
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,760
Where do people feel like? I don't know.

767
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:45,482
He doesn't want people to eat people.

768
00:49:45,556 --> 00:49:48,086
And that wasn't something he was advocating at all.

769
00:49:48,208 --> 00:49:57,714
Magnus very astutely deduced that his words had, quote, being hijacked by people who don't believe that global warming and other climate issues should be taken seriously.

770
00:49:57,822 --> 00:50:03,326
And one of those people was a writer for the Epoch Times who wrote a headline that Alex is now reading on air.

771
00:50:03,448 --> 00:50:08,426
This is a bullshit story with no connection to reality that was published three years ago.

772
00:50:08,548 --> 00:50:12,002
So this string of headlines is off to a very strong start.

773
00:50:12,076 --> 00:50:16,530
So you're saying that the Swedes have not started eating each other? Not to my knowledge.

774
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:20,634
Okay, all right, look, I don't have anybody on the update.

775
00:50:20,682 --> 00:50:22,250
Where's Sonia? Sonia.

776
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:25,950
So here's the next headline.

777
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:32,382
Video Transcript biden Transport Secretary again touts expensive electric vehicles.

778
00:50:32,406 --> 00:50:34,098
A solution for high gas prices.

779
00:50:34,194 --> 00:50:42,138
So, yeah, Pete, but a judge said that maybe electric cars, maybe we could get some subsidies for people to be able to afford electric cars.

780
00:50:42,174 --> 00:50:52,120
And that is related to eating people how? Well, because he said that the Swedish person said that you should eat people to help with climate change, which isn't really true.

781
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:55,874
Okay, so maybe the climate change aspect of it is.

782
00:50:55,912 --> 00:50:56,500
Right.

783
00:50:56,950 --> 00:50:58,938
I appreciate you trying to track the connection.

784
00:50:58,974 --> 00:51:05,754
I'm doing my best because he said that they're specifically all connected and all I have right now is sweetie people and drive electric cars.

785
00:51:05,802 --> 00:51:08,334
Well, let's see if we can find some more connective tissues.

786
00:51:08,382 --> 00:51:08,954
Okay.

787
00:51:09,112 --> 00:51:09,738
Hypocrite.

788
00:51:09,774 --> 00:51:15,100
Trudeau caught magic or flying on a private jet, but he says you shouldn't be able to have air conditioning or a car.

789
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:22,418
I thought it was Obama who didn't want people to have air conditioner or a car, which isn't true to begin with, but it's something that Alex repeats a lot.

790
00:51:22,504 --> 00:51:24,890
But I guess it's now just toss it on there.

791
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:30,278
I'm starting to suspect that maybe Alex really is just cold reading headlines and hasn't seen any of these things at all.

792
00:51:30,304 --> 00:51:38,294
But he's just pretending they're connected because we have a three year old article about cannibalism, comments that Pete Buttigieg made about electric cars, right.

793
00:51:38,332 --> 00:51:41,238
And a picture of Trudeau not wearing a mask.

794
00:51:41,394 --> 00:51:46,914
This can't be the super important work the globalists want to distract Alex from, because this is ridiculous.

795
00:51:47,022 --> 00:51:54,542
I wrote down earlier whenever he was saying, like, this is all a distraction from my work and I won't allow it.

796
00:51:54,556 --> 00:52:07,590
And it's like, if that is true, just on its face, shouldn't the news currently be gargantuate during the trial? Now, maybe you could even consider Trump's raid being gargantuan.

797
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:19,334
But that was after the trial, right? So during the trial, shouldn't there have been a nonstop barrage of like, holy shit, there are fires going up inside of your home right now? Because then Alex would be able to cover it.

798
00:52:19,372 --> 00:52:20,270
Exactly, right.

799
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:23,178
That would justify the distraction era.

800
00:52:23,274 --> 00:52:28,794
But I feel like the news was mainly like, we're going to try and lower gas taxes.

801
00:52:28,842 --> 00:52:29,450
No.

802
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:36,700
Sweden has given the green light before on eating people, but Alex doesn't know that and he's presenting it as current.

803
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:43,910
I guess we had to sue Alex Jones to make sure that Swedes could eat people.

804
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,700
And let me say this real quick.

805
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:52,310
I know what the Swedes do with meatballs, and if that's the precedent of how they're going to serve people, I'm out.

806
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,320
I'm out too.

807
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:54,710
Thank you.

808
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:59,618
I'm just saying that Scandinavian food is not bad food, but there are way better food.

809
00:52:59,644 --> 00:53:04,058
You're not going to trick me to eat people with Lincoln berries, I can tell you that right now.

810
00:53:04,144 --> 00:53:06,914
I won't even eat their fish, let alone their people.

811
00:53:07,012 --> 00:53:07,730
Boo.

812
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:10,070
So here's the next headline.

813
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:24,486
The climate cult is eager to take advantage of Europe's energy crisis, and they're now announcing in Spain and Germany they're going to control remotely, as we told you, decades they would with the smart meters, what temperature you can set your house to no lower than 80.

814
00:53:24,558 --> 00:53:32,442
So this is just an oped on zero hedge that's completely meaningless as proof of anything and doesn't even include any bits about remotely controlling people's.

815
00:53:32,466 --> 00:53:45,750
Thermostats that stuff that Alex is writing his own story about, but it's very real issues surrounding energy rationing proposals in countries that could be more directly affected by Russia's ability to control the flow of oil and natural gas.

816
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:46,178
Right.

817
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:58,026
It's less a question of remotely controlling smart meter thermostats and more city councils being asked to do everything they can to conserve energy after this is a string of headlines about reducing car ownership.

818
00:53:58,098 --> 00:54:07,900
So I guess that a bunch of these headlines could be said to be connected, but I'm struggling to make the larger, meaningful connection, and the cannibalism is just flashy and fun.

819
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:14,462
I think that I understand what Alex wants the connection to be, but it's pretty much just in his head.

820
00:54:14,596 --> 00:54:17,382
He's basically laying out the climate change advocates.

821
00:54:17,526 --> 00:54:24,854
It's an elaborate plot to destroy society through making people unable to have energy resources, which will make them unable to get any food.

822
00:54:24,892 --> 00:54:29,022
So I guess the media is trying to prepare people for the idea of eating other humans.

823
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:35,042
Mind you, this is entirely different than Alex's big rant about how he was willing to barbecue his neighbors to feed his children.

824
00:54:35,176 --> 00:54:38,022
When Alex discusses cannibalism, that's actually genius.

825
00:54:38,106 --> 00:54:44,430
And he's making a larger point, whereas when people he doesn't like to do it, it's proof of Insidious plan to depopulate the planet.

826
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:50,054
This list of headlines is legitimately depressing, and he does not need a lawsuit to distract him from doing his job.

827
00:54:50,092 --> 00:54:53,778
He's doing fine on his own, and his job is completely meaningless.

828
00:54:53,934 --> 00:54:54,398
Yes.

829
00:54:54,484 --> 00:54:55,010
I don't know.

830
00:54:55,060 --> 00:55:04,166
You just don't get to complain about cannibalism if you have already made the plan in your mind to murder your neighbors and feed them to your kids.

831
00:55:04,228 --> 00:55:04,840
Yeah.

832
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:07,638
High profile, publicly, totally.

833
00:55:07,734 --> 00:55:08,670
Say it out loud.

834
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:12,522
You're on the record as that as being an acceptable strategy.

835
00:55:12,666 --> 00:55:17,178
When it comes to that, I feel like you shouldn't be able to talk shit.

836
00:55:17,214 --> 00:55:17,570
I know.

837
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:20,402
It was a pretty graphic thing.

838
00:55:20,476 --> 00:55:21,678
He was very graphic.

839
00:55:21,714 --> 00:55:25,106
It was like his neighbor accidentally hit his window with a baseball that day.

840
00:55:25,228 --> 00:55:29,886
So we have a couple more headlines, even though I had lost my patience with this, naturally.

841
00:55:30,018 --> 00:55:31,862
But yeah, there's some that are actually kind of interesting.

842
00:55:31,936 --> 00:55:32,462
Okay.

843
00:55:32,596 --> 00:55:37,254
Australia's Great Barrier Reef defies climate doomsayers with record coral comeback.

844
00:55:37,362 --> 00:55:38,870
The truth is, coral reefs grow.

845
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:39,974
They die, they come back.

846
00:55:40,012 --> 00:55:41,440
They die, they come back.

847
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:42,170
Wow.

848
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:44,394
The headline that he's reading off Breitbart.

849
00:55:44,442 --> 00:55:47,174
But it's kind of a dishonest framing of the story.

850
00:55:47,332 --> 00:55:53,510
While it is true that parts of the Great Barrier Reef are seeing considerable healing, that's not true of the reef as a whole.

851
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:59,246
The northern area of the reef saw gains in hard coral cover, but the southern section actually went down.

852
00:55:59,428 --> 00:56:02,630
This is good news, but it's part of a larger picture.

853
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:09,426
One of the main concerns about the reef is hard coral cover, but another equally important aspect is bleaching.

854
00:56:09,558 --> 00:56:17,798
Bleaching is the result of a temperature or weather anomaly that leads to the coral expelling the algae that give it its color, resulting in the coral becoming white.

855
00:56:17,944 --> 00:56:22,062
It's not dead at that point, but it's at a significantly greater risk.

856
00:56:22,206 --> 00:56:26,178
And importantly, reefs are complicated systems that are capable of healing.

857
00:56:26,214 --> 00:56:33,470
So if there is some bleaching, the coral can become home to algae again and come back to what you call like a vibrant life.

858
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,058
Right.

859
00:56:34,204 --> 00:56:40,638
The concern among scientists is that weather events that cause large scale bleaching have been increasing in frequency.

860
00:56:40,794 --> 00:56:48,198
There have been four mass bleaching events in the past seven years and experts don't know how resilient the reefs are to this heightening pressure.

861
00:56:48,294 --> 00:56:51,618
It's an open question and it's frightening.

862
00:56:51,714 --> 00:56:52,850
The implications.

863
00:56:53,530 --> 00:57:12,426
Another aspect that is of concern is mentioned in a Reuters story about this quote on the downside, the growth in cover has been driven by acropora corals, which the Australian Institute of Marine Sciences said are particularly vulnerable to wave damage, heat stress and crown of thorns starfish.

864
00:57:12,618 --> 00:57:24,198
This is coral cover that is increasing, which is good, but it's a type of coral that's highly likely to be susceptible to the sorts of weather events that are becoming increasingly common, which is a big reason to be worried.

865
00:57:24,354 --> 00:57:34,698
This increase in cover could lead to false hope, or conversely, to people like Alex ignoring the details of the story in order to use it as a prop to attack climate science as invalid.

866
00:57:34,854 --> 00:57:40,962
As per usual, Alex has no idea what he's talking about, but he's got a bright bart headline and that's enough to trick his audience into thick knees.

867
00:57:40,986 --> 00:57:41,694
An expert.

868
00:57:41,802 --> 00:57:55,950
So we were at a museum and whole area in San Francisco a few years back and they had this massive section of the place.

869
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:01,294
Now, it used to be something different and now it was just all devoted to the coral reef.

870
00:58:01,402 --> 00:58:13,614
And the way that coral was dying and everything was so fucking sad because their goal was like, you used to walk in here and see some cool stuff and then be like, wow, that was fun.

871
00:58:13,712 --> 00:58:18,562
Now I'm going to go fight Australians to save the coral reef.

872
00:58:18,646 --> 00:58:20,394
That's how you walk out of there.

873
00:58:20,492 --> 00:58:23,382
And it is a tragic, tragic situation.

874
00:58:23,456 --> 00:58:23,910
True.

875
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:34,954
And then some of the positive news that ends up coming out and you hear about the Great Barrier Reef is the result of very aggressive conservation effort.

876
00:58:35,002 --> 00:58:35,600
Yeah.

877
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:44,730
And so when you're like, oh, why isn't it dying so fast? Because people are taking it very seriously, as hard as they possibly can with everything they've got all the time.

878
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:47,190
You try to pick up a piece of coral and they will snipe you.

879
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:47,418
Yeah.

880
00:58:47,444 --> 00:58:53,298
And I don't even want you reporting good news about it, because then people are going to be like, oh, things are getting better.

881
00:58:53,384 --> 00:58:58,580
No, you're just not reporting enough news about how it's dying every single day.

882
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:01,558
I think that balance is tough to strike.

883
00:59:01,594 --> 00:59:02,418
It is a little bit.

884
00:59:02,444 --> 00:59:03,020
Difficult.

885
00:59:03,350 --> 00:59:04,510
So we get another headline.

886
00:59:04,570 --> 00:59:05,900
Okay, this one's fun.

887
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:07,294
Major new findings.

888
00:59:07,342 --> 00:59:11,086
They are reanimating not just dead spiders, but now pigs.

889
00:59:11,218 --> 00:59:12,860
Frankenstein is real.

890
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:14,394
From NBC News.

891
00:59:14,492 --> 00:59:15,154
Holy shit.

892
00:59:15,202 --> 00:59:16,290
Get the torches.

893
00:59:16,730 --> 00:59:21,750
Does he think that the soul is included with the reanimation? I don't know.

894
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,682
He doesn't expound on this at all.

895
00:59:23,756 --> 00:59:24,522
I want more.

896
00:59:24,596 --> 00:59:25,818
So, Jordan, I have some news for you.

897
00:59:25,844 --> 00:59:27,598
What's that? No one's reanimating spiders.

898
00:59:27,634 --> 00:59:28,350
God damn it.

899
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:36,306
Alex probably just saw a headline about research that was done at Rice University where they found that they could use dead spiders as a way of gripping things.

900
00:59:36,488 --> 00:59:45,550
Essentially, it has to do with how spider legs bend and how all you really need to do to manipulate them is apply a hydraulic pressure inside the spider's abdomen.

901
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:52,402
The researchers used a needle to puff air into them and found that they were able to expand and retract the spider's legs.

902
00:59:52,546 --> 01:00:01,390
Personally, I think this is a little fucked up, but I don't know how much of a high horse any of us has to be about like, oh, you got to respect the sanctity of dead spider.

903
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:04,902
Yeah, I'm not sure it's weird, but it's pretty interesting.

904
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:09,990
If I stepped on it a few days ago, I can't be mad if somebody's like, look, I can make it legs work.

905
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,002
Right? I'm not going to be mad.

906
01:00:11,026 --> 01:00:20,130
If you watch the video with the researchers too, one of the things they bring up, it's like it's kind of tough to argue with, is that it is like biodegradable material.

907
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:21,260
Sure.

908
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:23,250
Right.

909
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:23,862
Okay.

910
01:00:23,936 --> 01:00:28,806
You end up in a strange position, though, if you're like, breeding spiders in order to kill them.

911
01:00:28,868 --> 01:00:33,198
Yeah, what are we talking about? I hope that would not be the path things go.

912
01:00:33,284 --> 01:00:33,930
Right.

913
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:37,050
Anyway, that's not the implication that Alex is taking.

914
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:38,590
I think they're reanimating.

915
01:00:38,770 --> 01:00:39,980
That's the issue.

916
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:46,050
As for the pig thing, alex just skimmed a headline about this, but it's a little closer to reanimation.

917
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:49,270
It's just not that it's a pig getting reanimated.

918
01:00:49,330 --> 01:00:50,910
It's a cellular thing.

919
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:58,486
This has some considerable philosophical implications and could stand to revolutionize processes used in organ donation.

920
01:00:58,618 --> 01:01:01,482
But it's not Frankenstein, or at least not yet.

921
01:01:01,676 --> 01:01:07,870
I do find myself unnerved slightly by this portion of an NBC News article about this quote.

922
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:13,486
The pigs treated with organic eggs startled researchers during experimentation.

923
01:01:13,558 --> 01:01:16,760
The dead pigs heads and necks moved under their own power.

924
01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:22,466
The animals remained under heavy anesthesia.

925
01:01:22,598 --> 01:01:28,810
The researchers do view the neck jerk as an indication that muscle function was restored after death.

926
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:35,362
If you're someone who believes that all science fiction is secretly real, I can see how you might respond to this like Alex does.

927
01:01:35,496 --> 01:01:37,378
It's silly, but I get it.

928
01:01:37,404 --> 01:01:37,990
Yeah.

929
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:41,786
Anyway, I'm still having trouble with the exposed connection of all these stories.

930
01:01:41,918 --> 01:01:47,470
Even these two stories allegedly, about reanimation aren't connected in any meaningful way at this point.

931
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:51,758
I was so bored of this list of headlines, and it's getting really redundant.

932
01:01:51,794 --> 01:01:54,418
So I decided it was time to move on from this fun run.

933
01:01:54,504 --> 01:02:07,066
Yeah, but that story about the pigs is like that is something I wish someone who is like Alex, but not Alex and maybe a little bit more in touch with reality could have a take on.

934
01:02:07,128 --> 01:02:13,680
Because I think it's a little bit like your reaction, there is a place for that, right.

935
01:02:14,550 --> 01:02:15,300
No.

936
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,138
Restore muscle.

937
01:02:17,294 --> 01:02:23,210
I think what's interesting to me about this is the idea of consciousness.

938
01:02:23,330 --> 01:02:34,774
Like, okay, you're worried about Frankenstein and all that stuff, but are you telling me that the consciousness returns with its previous memories? Of course not.

939
01:02:34,932 --> 01:02:54,418
Otherwise what you're saying do spiders have a meaningful no, but what I'm thinking is, if you're saying that reanimation is possible, then when I die, I'll die, my consciousness will end, and then suddenly I will theoretically awaken years later in the same or a different body.

940
01:02:54,504 --> 01:02:55,858
Like, that's not how it works.

941
01:02:55,944 --> 01:02:56,446
No.

942
01:02:56,568 --> 01:02:59,710
So there's no such thing as the soul, is what I'm trying to say.

943
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:00,322
That's fine.

944
01:03:00,396 --> 01:03:00,670
Yes.

945
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:04,306
That's not even close to anything that is implied by these.

946
01:03:04,428 --> 01:03:06,994
Right? No, that's the only thing I care about.

947
01:03:07,032 --> 01:03:10,846
When you talk about pigs coming back to life, I'm like, I'm worried their souls aren't going to be okay.

948
01:03:10,908 --> 01:03:19,954
Well, one of the things that comes up in articles about this is the sort of philosophical implications in terms of what do we categorize as death? Right.

949
01:03:19,992 --> 01:03:31,582
Because if someone has a heart attack and their heart stops, which is your heart's muscle, if they're able to pump the heart, re, bring back muscle tissue sure.

950
01:03:31,656 --> 01:03:41,820
Is that something that they would be able to do? There are all kinds of questions that are raised by this, but yeah, it's not like you've been dead for a week and now we can bring you back.

951
01:03:43,230 --> 01:03:44,954
Okay, so you're brain dead.

952
01:03:45,062 --> 01:03:49,750
They can't bring back the function of your nerves, so far as we're aware.

953
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:51,166
I don't know.

954
01:03:51,288 --> 01:04:00,720
What, are you just going to jolt people with electricity like in Frankenstein? Based on Alex's coverage? I feel like that's the plan.

955
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:05,210
Okay.

956
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:05,558
Yeah.

957
01:04:05,584 --> 01:04:06,400
I don't know.

958
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:14,042
From what I've actually read on this, I think we'll find out more when there's more research done.

959
01:04:14,176 --> 01:04:14,762
Sure.

960
01:04:14,896 --> 01:04:17,800
Pretty early stages on a lot of this stuff.

961
01:04:18,850 --> 01:04:20,814
Probably not Frankenstein.

962
01:04:20,922 --> 01:04:25,190
We're not at the dolly, the sheep level of bringing people back to life.

963
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:25,526
No.

964
01:04:25,588 --> 01:04:26,138
Got you.

965
01:04:26,224 --> 01:04:28,206
So you brought up the torn larynx.

966
01:04:28,278 --> 01:04:28,442
Sure.

967
01:04:28,456 --> 01:04:28,734
Earlier.

968
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:30,570
And I told you there was a torn.

969
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:31,562
There's a phone update on there.

970
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:32,630
Oh, yeah, it's healed.

971
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:33,662
Actually.

972
01:04:33,796 --> 01:04:35,920
There's a suspect in this.

973
01:04:36,370 --> 01:04:39,494
And all the studies show 5G causes major asthma and problems.

974
01:04:39,592 --> 01:04:48,700
And I'm literally driving down Congress this morning after an hour in court to get to the show, and I'm coughing the way I've never coughed in my life.

975
01:04:49,030 --> 01:05:02,270
And I said, you know, the studies are 5G causes serious breathing problems and coughing like this, it only happens when I'm in 5G areas, they need those for self driving cars.

976
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:05,558
And all of a sudden a Ford self driving car drives by.

977
01:05:05,644 --> 01:05:06,474
But it went internally.

978
01:05:06,522 --> 01:05:07,418
We didn't get video of it.

979
01:05:07,444 --> 01:05:10,598
A robot car drive by two minutes after I was selling my security guys.

980
01:05:10,624 --> 01:05:12,146
That's crazy.

981
01:05:12,268 --> 01:05:12,662
Wow.

982
01:05:12,736 --> 01:05:14,394
Robot cars make them cough.

983
01:05:14,562 --> 01:05:24,566
That reminds me, outside of the courthouse, I was making the jokes and I didn't reference five g to rob DU's tiedyed friend.

984
01:05:24,628 --> 01:05:25,142
Yes.

985
01:05:25,276 --> 01:05:32,118
And now here, she didn't even know that the 5G from her phone was causing Alex's cough in the courtroom.

986
01:05:32,154 --> 01:05:35,042
Well, I mean, I just assumed that courtroom is full of 5G.

987
01:05:35,176 --> 01:05:37,106
She was the one who had the biggest phone, though.

988
01:05:37,168 --> 01:05:38,510
I noticed that on the stand.

989
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,466
Alex didn't say, five g is making me call.

990
01:05:40,528 --> 01:05:45,038
He did not say crazy flies on his show.

991
01:05:45,184 --> 01:05:46,206
I wonder why he said it's.

992
01:05:46,218 --> 01:05:46,914
Torn larynx.

993
01:05:46,962 --> 01:05:47,498
Yeah.

994
01:05:47,644 --> 01:05:54,402
Anyway, he leaves and then he comes back in the fourth hour right after having gone to the courthouse.

995
01:05:54,486 --> 01:06:04,250
How did it go for it? Well, we have not figured out yet exactly what the judgment will be, but the fourth hour starts and they just play special reports like what's going on here? Sure.

996
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:09,534
We get 20 minutes in and Alex finally shows up with Barnes and toe.

997
01:06:09,702 --> 01:06:20,654
Well, we have an update on that, but also I should say in advance, alex uses an r slur here and I just want to it's no good.

998
01:06:20,812 --> 01:06:21,230
All right.

999
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:28,000
We ran some promos earlier because for some reason robert Barnes was here sitting around for like an hour waiting to go on air, and he thinks he's supposed to be on air, so he left.

1000
01:06:30,410 --> 01:06:31,770
We're not going to be stopped.

1001
01:06:32,450 --> 01:06:33,558
Not going to happen.

1002
01:06:33,704 --> 01:06:37,494
There's so little human communication now, though, like person to person.

1003
01:06:37,652 --> 01:06:44,286
And that's how the globalists are beating us, is people don't communicate with each other at the shopping mall or the store.

1004
01:06:44,348 --> 01:06:46,722
You don't even tell barn sweating what's going on.

1005
01:06:46,796 --> 01:06:47,970
Mentally retarded.

1006
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:52,220
That's really the fount of all of this.

1007
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:59,118
So he wasn't on air for 20 minutes because Barnes thought he didn't need to go on air.

1008
01:06:59,144 --> 01:07:02,480
So he left and he was trying to call Barnes and convince him to come back.

1009
01:07:04,610 --> 01:07:05,610
That's crazy.

1010
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:07,018
I can't go on without you, Barnes.

1011
01:07:07,054 --> 01:07:09,022
That is absolute insanity.

1012
01:07:09,106 --> 01:07:10,520
People don't talk to each other.

1013
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:13,170
You can text in the courthouse.

1014
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:15,714
I was on my phone the whole time.

1015
01:07:15,752 --> 01:07:16,374
It's true.

1016
01:07:16,472 --> 01:07:20,742
You could have texted Barnes when he were going to be back to go on air, but that would have happened.

1017
01:07:20,756 --> 01:07:22,590
Debated the made him call.

1018
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,954
G doesn't want to do he's right.

1019
01:07:24,992 --> 01:07:25,482
You're right.

1020
01:07:25,556 --> 01:07:26,178
Everybody's right.

1021
01:07:26,204 --> 01:07:30,546
So look, man, alex, he said he was going to cover the news when he came back in the fourth hour.

1022
01:07:30,608 --> 01:07:30,870
Sure.

1023
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:33,200
But now he can't because Barnes isn't there.

1024
01:07:33,590 --> 01:07:33,954
Watch.

1025
01:07:33,992 --> 01:07:35,730
Humanity dying is so sad.

1026
01:07:37,070 --> 01:07:37,918
So sad.

1027
01:07:38,014 --> 01:07:39,774
But it's like a skeleton coming down fast.

1028
01:07:39,812 --> 01:07:41,180
But I'm miles above you.

1029
01:07:43,010 --> 01:07:45,094
I mean, the globalists who are trying to bring down humanity.

1030
01:07:45,142 --> 01:07:46,050
Good, safe.

1031
01:07:47,450 --> 01:07:48,294
We have a lot to cover.

1032
01:07:48,332 --> 01:07:49,338
Prepared for hours for this.

1033
01:07:49,364 --> 01:07:50,886
But we sit around 20 minutes.

1034
01:07:50,948 --> 01:07:52,050
They're like, Get out of here.

1035
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:52,746
Come on, now.

1036
01:07:52,808 --> 01:07:54,680
Gorillas knocking her head up against the wall.

1037
01:07:56,090 --> 01:07:56,958
It won't matter soon.

1038
01:07:56,984 --> 01:07:59,058
The food's getting cut off and it just gets off.

1039
01:07:59,204 --> 01:08:00,498
I think it's actually a good thing.

1040
01:08:00,524 --> 01:08:02,410
We've already killed so many kids in the womb.

1041
01:08:02,530 --> 01:08:05,250
Let's just start starving everybody to death right out of the oven.

1042
01:08:06,710 --> 01:08:08,060
That is where we are.

1043
01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:18,270
All the Wimps that have lived off the system, all the frauds that have hidden behind their BS, it's all over now.

1044
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:21,260
So I guess we all deserve to die because Barnes isn't there.

1045
01:08:21,650 --> 01:08:22,966
This is a mood swing.

1046
01:08:23,038 --> 01:08:24,870
Yeah, that happened quick.

1047
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,526
That happened quick.

1048
01:08:26,648 --> 01:08:28,640
He's so mad at me.

1049
01:08:33,030 --> 01:08:35,182
Somebody had abortions one time.

1050
01:08:35,256 --> 01:08:36,670
Let's all die.

1051
01:08:37,290 --> 01:08:38,340
Yeah, right.

1052
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:43,522
I feel like the judgment hasn't even come down, really.

1053
01:08:43,596 --> 01:08:45,446
He's just bard.

1054
01:08:45,638 --> 01:08:46,620
My God.

1055
01:08:47,730 --> 01:08:49,010
Alex is in a bad mood.

1056
01:08:49,070 --> 01:08:49,798
Yeah, I can tell.

1057
01:08:49,824 --> 01:08:50,978
Because you're unconscious.

1058
01:08:51,074 --> 01:08:52,210
You will die.

1059
01:08:52,890 --> 01:08:53,326
Okay.

1060
01:08:53,388 --> 01:08:54,626
Because you're living in a dream.

1061
01:08:54,698 --> 01:08:56,030
You will be destroyed.

1062
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:58,500
Aren't you going to die? You don't live in a dream here.

1063
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:00,334
I don't live in a fantasy land.

1064
01:09:00,372 --> 01:09:01,440
I live in the real world.

1065
01:09:06,130 --> 01:09:15,594
That's painful to watch, but nevertheless, everybody's got their own idea how things work.

1066
01:09:15,632 --> 01:09:18,800
So you go ahead and do it your way and see what happens.

1067
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:25,800
Okay? I have a few video clips I want to play here.

1068
01:09:26,730 --> 01:09:28,970
And one of them is Dick Cheney.

1069
01:09:29,030 --> 01:09:30,370
The war criminal.

1070
01:09:31,170 --> 01:09:32,366
The torture master.

1071
01:09:32,438 --> 01:09:33,998
The architect of 911.

1072
01:09:34,094 --> 01:09:35,650
The globalist criminal.

1073
01:09:36,210 --> 01:09:41,294
The guy that sold America out for the Council on Foreign Relations and made jokes about it on national TV.

1074
01:09:41,402 --> 01:09:43,630
How he was an enemy of America.

1075
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:57,434
Has the nerve to get up and say people running against his daughter in her congressional race are the enemies and that Trump is the enemy.

1076
01:09:57,542 --> 01:10:04,630
So one angle on Dick Cheney putting out a video saying Trump sucks is to lash out at Cheney and say, who are you to talk to? I bet that's fair.

1077
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:11,066
Another way to look at it is that Cheney is a fucking monster of historical scale, and even he realizes that Trump is a pile of shit.

1078
01:10:11,198 --> 01:10:14,230
I guess this is a glass half full or half empty thing.

1079
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:15,658
And you have that.

1080
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:16,354
Yeah.

1081
01:10:16,512 --> 01:10:18,120
You guys have fun? Yeah.

1082
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:19,114
Cool.

1083
01:10:19,152 --> 01:10:19,874
Joy.

1084
01:10:20,042 --> 01:10:22,138
So Barnes shows up.

1085
01:10:22,284 --> 01:10:23,926
What? Yeah.

1086
01:10:24,048 --> 01:10:26,014
Why? He pulled the car around.

1087
01:10:26,112 --> 01:10:26,446
No.

1088
01:10:26,508 --> 01:10:27,178
Don't show up.

1089
01:10:27,204 --> 01:10:27,482
Barnes.

1090
01:10:27,506 --> 01:10:29,842
You're just going to get his bad mood on you.

1091
01:10:29,916 --> 01:10:32,602
No, actually, Alex's mood changes a bit.

1092
01:10:32,676 --> 01:10:37,260
No, he perks up a little bit and makes me think that maybe Barnes is holding or something.

1093
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:39,674
But here's a little secret.

1094
01:10:39,782 --> 01:10:47,218
They don't want me to say it until everything's closed out, but under Texas law, their $4 million judgment is half.

1095
01:10:47,364 --> 01:10:52,270
And if they do a huge billion dollar putative, it's capped at one point.

1096
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:52,978
Something million.

1097
01:10:53,064 --> 01:10:53,278
Yeah.

1098
01:10:53,304 --> 01:10:53,426
It's.

1099
01:10:53,438 --> 01:10:55,462
750,000 bankston was out there the other day.

1100
01:10:55,476 --> 01:11:02,662
The plaintiff's lawyer was out there spinning to the media how there was going to be a 50 million, $100 million kind of judgment coming in.

1101
01:11:02,676 --> 01:11:05,026
Punitive damages completely got wrong.

1102
01:11:05,088 --> 01:11:08,470
The media was recycling this as if it was the truth about Texas law.

1103
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:11,640
The AP says I'm worth 270000000.

1104
01:11:12,330 --> 01:11:15,086
This company has majorities I'm in the hole.

1105
01:11:15,158 --> 01:11:15,430
Exactly.

1106
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,770
That's why I tell my wife I got to bow the yard.

1107
01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:21,194
I'm telling her we got to fire the lawn staff.

1108
01:11:21,302 --> 01:11:30,010
Yeah, you're in tough times if you think that endears you to me and makes you a relatable character.

1109
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:33,674
Honey, we can't afford our gardener anymore.

1110
01:11:33,722 --> 01:11:35,102
No, he said garden staff.

1111
01:11:35,186 --> 01:11:35,710
That's right.

1112
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:36,806
He said staff.

1113
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:42,266
Alex.

1114
01:11:42,338 --> 01:11:48,910
I think there's something about Barnes that just brightens up a room, and I think you can feel it.

1115
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:51,538
Alex is so much happier now that Barnes is there.

1116
01:11:51,624 --> 01:11:52,730
He's got his buddy.

1117
01:11:52,790 --> 01:12:01,346
There is something about Barnes's ability to weather so much bullshit and kind of like, spin it into a, like, little positive thing for Alex.

1118
01:12:01,478 --> 01:12:03,130
It is kind of a gift he has.

1119
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:06,818
I think that he hypnotizes Alex with his phrases.

1120
01:12:06,914 --> 01:12:07,560
Yeah.

1121
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:10,430
He says blank and blank.

1122
01:12:10,490 --> 01:12:11,650
Yeah, all the time.

1123
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:12,166
Yes.

1124
01:12:12,288 --> 01:12:13,810
They're dipping and dodging.

1125
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:16,980
They're the gribble pimples of anybody.

1126
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:18,374
They are lying.

1127
01:12:18,422 --> 01:12:20,930
And it's almost always illiterative.

1128
01:12:21,050 --> 01:12:25,246
And there's something about those speech patterns that I think Alex gets sucked into.

1129
01:12:25,308 --> 01:12:26,602
It's not a bad thing to learn.

1130
01:12:26,676 --> 01:12:27,130
Yeah.

1131
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:35,174
So look, most of this fourth hour is Barnes being full of shit and advertising.

1132
01:12:35,222 --> 01:12:36,922
It's really just trying to get money.

1133
01:12:36,996 --> 01:12:37,558
Right.

1134
01:12:37,704 --> 01:12:38,602
Here's my problem.

1135
01:12:38,676 --> 01:12:43,582
I could get major National Foods guys that are on Handy and on Back, and I'm not attacking them.

1136
01:12:43,656 --> 01:12:44,734
Maybe they're smarter than me.

1137
01:12:44,772 --> 01:12:46,558
Their food makes 60, 70%.

1138
01:12:46,704 --> 01:12:49,690
Ours makes 30% because it is the best lowest price.

1139
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:52,894
I have this weird neurotic thing to give our Listers the best deal, right.

1140
01:12:52,932 --> 01:12:55,714
So I would probably actually be rich like them if I did that.

1141
01:12:55,812 --> 01:12:57,074
Oh, man, that's wild.

1142
01:12:57,242 --> 01:13:05,830
Did you know that Alex gets his survival food buckets from my Patriot Supply? I did know that because Glenn Beck sells his survival food through my Patriot Supply, too, for years.

1143
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:12,554
I'm not sure if Hannity actually sells food buckets at this point, but he definitely did it in the past through my Patriot Supply.

1144
01:13:12,602 --> 01:13:13,030
Oh, yeah.

1145
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:27,902
They also sponsored Dan Bongino and have sponsored Ben Shapiro and Rush Limbaugh and countless other right wing shit talkers who seem to include an insistence that you'll soon need emergency food because the government is going to go full dictatorship in the rhetoric, which is just a strange coincidence.

1146
01:13:27,926 --> 01:13:28,994
It's a good strategy.

1147
01:13:29,102 --> 01:13:30,454
It really fucking work.

1148
01:13:30,492 --> 01:13:48,120
So what you're telling me is that even if I'm a huge Shapiro fan, or even if I'm a huge Glenn Beck fan, what I should do is instead of getting my Matrix supply from them, I'll get a cheaper price from Alex, correct? In theory, yes, but I don't think that's true.

1149
01:13:49,110 --> 01:13:53,590
I have, in the past, gone and looked at, like, various deals that were offered.

1150
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:55,042
I don't think that's true.

1151
01:13:55,116 --> 01:14:08,280
What I think is going on, if Alex is describing anything that's real, it's that he has such a bad negotiating position that he gets a lower cut than Ben Shapiro or Glenn Beck does.

1152
01:14:08,850 --> 01:14:10,790
That would be my hunch.

1153
01:14:10,910 --> 01:14:12,254
Yeah, that's more likely.

1154
01:14:12,422 --> 01:14:18,410
But yeah, it's all the same company that's playing all of these people, their buckets.

1155
01:14:18,590 --> 01:14:19,978
Probably not Jim Baker, though.

1156
01:14:20,004 --> 01:14:21,614
I think he probably has a different operation.

1157
01:14:21,662 --> 01:14:24,014
I think he puts his own food in those buckets.

1158
01:14:24,122 --> 01:14:25,430
Yeah, he cooks it himself.

1159
01:14:25,490 --> 01:14:26,450
Yeah, he sells.

1160
01:14:26,510 --> 01:14:37,946
So Barnes has an interesting theory about what's coming in the punitive case here, two jurors wouldn't even join in the verdict, and for the punitive damages, they need unanimous jurors to even get any punitive.

1161
01:14:38,018 --> 01:14:41,710
What's your prediction this afternoon? Or maybe it'll be longer on punitive.

1162
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:51,010
I don't think that you said I don't mean to kiss your ass, but you said beforehand yesterday, you said on air, you said, I think it's below 5 million.

1163
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:55,082
There's a very good chance that they can't even get puma.

1164
01:14:55,166 --> 01:15:00,238
Yeah, well, that's a seven figure verdict, and I don't think the punitive damages is going to come in anywhere near what they're talking about.

1165
01:15:00,324 --> 01:15:11,882
Again, it's purely show at theater, symbolic at this point, because the cap is 1.5 between both claims before Alex cut them off, barnes seemed to be going in the direction of I don't think they're going to get any punitive damage.

1166
01:15:11,906 --> 01:15:15,394
They're very much downplaying what will come back.

1167
01:15:15,492 --> 01:15:24,180
I think that's part of their storyline that's still going on, that they pilled the jury and they saw through it and everything.

1168
01:15:26,070 --> 01:15:31,560
It's going to be a little bit of a deflation when the 50 million number comes around.

1169
01:15:32,490 --> 01:15:39,026
It's interesting to hear about the cap, because the more I read about it, the less clear it becomes.

1170
01:15:39,158 --> 01:15:56,002
And from what Mark has told me is that part of the reason that this whole thing is going to get weird is that if they want to, there's something written within the caps of, like, if this is extraordinary bullshit beyond what anybody could reasonably expect.

1171
01:15:56,136 --> 01:15:57,070
Fuck the cap.

1172
01:15:57,180 --> 01:15:58,930
Let's go hard on this guy.

1173
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,286
Like, that kind of thing.

1174
01:16:00,408 --> 01:16:03,934
But that's going to lead to appeals and appeals and all that stuff.

1175
01:16:04,032 --> 01:16:10,102
So I'm not sure, but whatever anybody is reporting about the cap, it is up in the air still.

1176
01:16:10,176 --> 01:16:10,450
Yeah.

1177
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:23,086
There are a number of different dynamics that are at play, as far as I know, about anything about the case and about how this law works.

1178
01:16:23,268 --> 01:16:24,238
Let's see what happens.

1179
01:16:24,264 --> 01:16:24,840
Exactly.

1180
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:27,274
I have no idea.

1181
01:16:27,372 --> 01:16:30,874
Everything I've read is like, who the fuck wrote this law? Yeah.

1182
01:16:30,912 --> 01:16:37,490
And I think that Alex's entire bankruptcy situation overcomplicates it even more, of course, and could work to his disadvantage.

1183
01:16:37,550 --> 01:16:38,242
Right.

1184
01:16:38,436 --> 01:16:39,418
And so we'll see.

1185
01:16:39,504 --> 01:16:46,594
Anyway, Barnes decides he's going to jump in with Alex on this whole, like, the judge is committing crimes thing.

1186
01:16:46,692 --> 01:16:47,858
Great idea for a lawyer.

1187
01:16:47,894 --> 01:16:48,058
Yeah.

1188
01:16:48,084 --> 01:16:49,226
I would say Barnes being a shit.

1189
01:16:49,238 --> 01:16:50,950
He's going to be a media star again.

1190
01:16:51,000 --> 01:17:00,610
I think it's criminal to have a judge say this is televised and that she cuts the YouTube off when we speak or lawyers speak she doesn't like, but only puts it on when they're having their people speak.

1191
01:17:00,660 --> 01:17:01,774
I mean, I think that's wrong.

1192
01:17:01,872 --> 01:17:03,062
I mean, all of it was scripted.

1193
01:17:03,146 --> 01:17:04,954
It was literally three movie cameras in there.

1194
01:17:04,992 --> 01:17:07,774
The only thing that went AWOL for them is they didn't get the ending that they wanted.

1195
01:17:07,812 --> 01:17:16,682
And they didn't get the ending they wanted because even a liberal Democratic jury in Austin that was selected by these plaintiffs lawyers rejected the core aspects of their theory and thesis.

1196
01:17:16,766 --> 01:17:21,718
They got to see you theory, thesis, and you were not the caricature that they tried to make you out to be.

1197
01:17:21,804 --> 01:17:29,578
And even though they played tracking those altered edited videos, sometimes only five, 7 seconds long, in fact, I think one was like 2 seconds long.

1198
01:17:29,664 --> 01:17:30,890
About you is 5 seconds.

1199
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:32,110
Yes, 5 seconds.

1200
01:17:32,670 --> 01:17:35,522
Personally, if I was a plaintiff lawyer, I would not have put me in the trial.

1201
01:17:35,606 --> 01:17:37,262
I would not have put things into the trial.

1202
01:17:37,286 --> 01:17:40,790
I would not have put the allegations and concerns about the judge into the trial.

1203
01:17:40,850 --> 01:17:43,814
You know who else didn't want to put Barnes into the trial? Barnes.

1204
01:17:43,862 --> 01:17:48,038
Yeah, he was Alex lawyer until shit got too hot and he quit or got fired.

1205
01:17:48,074 --> 01:17:53,078
And now the Info's corporate rep has testified under oath that they're exploring suing him for malpractice.

1206
01:17:53,234 --> 01:17:54,818
This is all just such horse shit.

1207
01:17:54,914 --> 01:18:04,030
Barnes is a weak loser hiding on Alex's show, pretending to have an expert opinion, acting like the reality that he took an active part in this didn't happen.

1208
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:14,270
How does he pretend to be a lawyer and then get on air and say that the case was scripted and the plaintiff's attorneys selected the jury as if that wasn't a process that the defense was equally involved in poorly.

1209
01:18:14,330 --> 01:18:15,706
This is just low.

1210
01:18:15,828 --> 01:18:17,350
This is nonsense.

1211
01:18:18,090 --> 01:18:18,730
I don't know.

1212
01:18:18,780 --> 01:18:21,974
He should give up his own license for engaging in this shit.

1213
01:18:22,022 --> 01:18:30,970
What he should have said is, if I was the defense's lawyer whenever they chose the jury, I wouldn't have said, Will you talk to me? Will you talk to me? I don't think he even will about that.

1214
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:32,350
No, I don't think he does either.

1215
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:37,966
So we have one last clip here from Friday, Alex's show at least.

1216
01:18:38,028 --> 01:18:38,362
Yes.

1217
01:18:38,436 --> 01:18:40,930
And this is just nonsense.

1218
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:44,194
Here is the same lawyer that the worst part is.

1219
01:18:44,232 --> 01:18:45,358
I said, lock her up.

1220
01:18:45,384 --> 01:18:48,218
So the end of the day, it's like we're here because he criticized Hillary.

1221
01:18:48,254 --> 01:18:53,306
Here it is, Alex Jones representative saying, I know he was reckless.

1222
01:18:53,438 --> 01:18:55,322
Alex knows he was reckless.

1223
01:18:55,466 --> 01:18:57,240
And then immediately going.

1224
01:18:58,170 --> 01:19:03,660
But Megan Kelly said it.

1225
01:19:04,650 --> 01:19:11,350
But the truthrs said but there were other websites.

1226
01:19:11,970 --> 01:19:18,900
But Hillary Clinton? Hell, at one point I thought he was going to start yelling or chanting, lock her up.

1227
01:19:22,450 --> 01:19:24,530
Wow, you guys are good at fake laughing.

1228
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:29,334
They're like, literally trying to sniff Hillary Clinton's butt.

1229
01:19:29,442 --> 01:19:31,134
But she's a politically dead item.

1230
01:19:31,242 --> 01:19:36,498
So that's the sort of clip where you have to ask yourself if Alex even thinks his audience is conscious.

1231
01:19:36,654 --> 01:19:44,054
It's clear what Wes is saying in that clip, that Alex is trying to dodge responsibility for his actions by saying that other people said things, too.

1232
01:19:44,152 --> 01:19:49,718
And then he punctuated his claim by joking that he was surprised that Alex didn't yell lock her up.

1233
01:19:49,864 --> 01:19:56,010
Alex is pretending that this is somehow a statement of support for Hillary or an admission that this case is only happening because of Hillary.

1234
01:19:56,130 --> 01:20:01,178
But it's pretty tough to get there from what the actual clip that is played says.

1235
01:20:01,264 --> 01:20:01,734
I can't.

1236
01:20:01,782 --> 01:20:12,594
I mean, that is so impregnably obvious that this is the most gaslighting that you can do and that laughter is so forced.

1237
01:20:12,762 --> 01:20:19,026
This is two dudes lying their asses off about the situation they're in, trying desperately to put on a triumphant face for the audience.

1238
01:20:19,098 --> 01:20:21,230
They need to keep giving them money.

1239
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:29,238
If there wasn't a resolution that could be spun as a victory here, the audience would probably get it through their heads that sending Alex money is throwing your money into a pit.

1240
01:20:29,334 --> 01:20:33,858
So it's critical to keep a stiff upper lip and pretend that you're having a great time being sued.

1241
01:20:33,954 --> 01:20:36,590
You actually won when you think about it.

1242
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:39,950
I mean, they rejected the theory of thesis.

1243
01:20:42,290 --> 01:20:52,270
In a certain sense, what has happened is that Alex Jones's money making operation is now a savings account for the families.

1244
01:20:52,390 --> 01:20:58,218
So the more money he makes, it's going to them at the end of the day.

1245
01:20:58,304 --> 01:21:00,870
Unless he's getting real fancy with some bookkeeping.

1246
01:21:01,550 --> 01:21:04,834
If he's getting real fancy with some bookkeeping, he's going to jail.

1247
01:21:04,882 --> 01:21:07,158
And I think that would be better than having a savings account.

1248
01:21:07,244 --> 01:21:11,710
Well, it would certainly limit his ability to bullshit.

1249
01:21:11,890 --> 01:21:20,286
So the Wool Room comes on and our boy, the Cock Destroyer, aka the puppet, comes on.

1250
01:21:20,348 --> 01:21:20,934
Sure.

1251
01:21:21,092 --> 01:21:23,970
And it's a little bit dramatic.

1252
01:21:24,830 --> 01:21:26,770
This is Mike Adams, level dramatic.

1253
01:21:26,830 --> 01:21:27,522
Okay.

1254
01:21:27,716 --> 01:22:24,870
Today is a major turning point in the political paradigm shift that has happened in the west that used to value individualism, freedom, prosperity, life, tradition, creation, what? And we now pivot into a dystopian Western world that values oppression, stopping the force of humanity, depopulation Satanism, anti life, anti freedom, antitruth but the important turning point, the important page that we turn today, is that now the American left, the liberal, progressive Democrat left in America, has now taken off the mask.

1255
01:22:25,670 --> 01:22:27,846
They now know they're the bad guys.

1256
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:28,578
Sure.

1257
01:22:28,724 --> 01:22:35,190
They have now accepted their role as the bad guys, and they are now embracing it wholly.

1258
01:22:36,170 --> 01:22:39,630
Okay? And so that is the point we're at now in human history.

1259
01:22:39,740 --> 01:22:41,842
This is some serious baby shit.

1260
01:22:41,986 --> 01:22:55,122
In all the course of human history, every good or bad decision that's ever been made that's had geopolitical consequences, many by left leaning politicians, has all been nothing compared to the day that Alex Jones learns that he has to pay people for defaming them.

1261
01:22:55,256 --> 01:23:02,110
Was it the end of the free world when Fox settled their defamation suit with Seth Rich's parents? Or when CNN settled with Nicholas Sandman.

1262
01:23:02,230 --> 01:23:06,126
I feel like it wasn't probably because Alex's Narcissism is so strong.

1263
01:23:06,188 --> 01:23:14,470
It's such an important part of what makes this show and everything on Infowars work for the audience that Owen has to tap into it in order to exist in that environment.

1264
01:23:14,650 --> 01:23:16,578
This is really pathetic to act this way.

1265
01:23:16,604 --> 01:23:21,282
And I have zero respect for Owen or his proclamations of us announcing that we're the bad guy.

1266
01:23:21,356 --> 01:23:24,390
But if he wants to act this way, I have just one thing to say to him.

1267
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:25,950
What's that? Hey, yo.

1268
01:23:26,870 --> 01:23:28,138
That's a Scott Hall reference.

1269
01:23:28,174 --> 01:23:29,300
You wouldn't have got it.

1270
01:23:29,930 --> 01:23:31,014
Wouldn't have gotten it.

1271
01:23:31,112 --> 01:23:32,790
Scott hall was the bad guy.

1272
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:35,770
I mean, here's the thing about a podcast.

1273
01:23:35,830 --> 01:23:41,218
It's like, know your audience, but if it's just you and me here so you do know an audience.

1274
01:23:41,374 --> 01:23:44,614
But bad times don't laugh.

1275
01:23:44,782 --> 01:23:46,160
Bad guys do.

1276
01:23:47,630 --> 01:23:55,340
Anyway, in the tradition of Alex before him, owen decides he's not hosting his show today either.

1277
01:23:55,910 --> 01:23:58,758
Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, August 5, 2022.

1278
01:23:58,784 --> 01:24:00,354
This is the Infowars war room.

1279
01:24:00,392 --> 01:24:02,300
Brought to you by Infowarstorecom.

1280
01:24:02,930 --> 01:24:05,814
And I have to tell you, today's broadcast is going to be a great one.

1281
01:24:05,852 --> 01:24:15,802
Now, I am live in studio right now, but Clay Clark is about to take over with so many great guests that it's going to be a great transmission.

1282
01:24:15,946 --> 01:24:24,178
So Clay Clark is this guy who does the Reawaken America tour, and they go and do these Q and on adjacent speakers.

1283
01:24:24,274 --> 01:24:25,534
And Alex.

1284
01:24:25,582 --> 01:24:27,510
Was there one? Jim Brewer.

1285
01:24:28,190 --> 01:24:33,078
Does anybody work there? Does anybody work there? Like Barnes didn't even no.

1286
01:24:33,164 --> 01:24:41,970
Hey, look, dude, I understand what you're saying, but as far as Owen goes, I'm going to give him a pass because he keeps having to host his own show.

1287
01:24:42,020 --> 01:24:42,990
And that's true.

1288
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:43,638
That's true.

1289
01:24:43,724 --> 01:24:44,346
It is true.

1290
01:24:44,408 --> 01:24:47,818
I have a little bit of sympathy for him because they are making him do double duty.

1291
01:24:47,854 --> 01:24:49,086
He is working awful hard.

1292
01:24:49,148 --> 01:24:49,410
Yes.

1293
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:56,506
But it is funny that on the day of Alex's punitive hearing, alex just decides, I'm going to go to the court.

1294
01:24:56,578 --> 01:25:01,510
And then Owen is like, what are we going to do? But he says that they have some big guests.

1295
01:25:01,570 --> 01:25:01,938
Sure.

1296
01:25:02,024 --> 01:25:03,358
Clay Clarke has some big guests.

1297
01:25:03,394 --> 01:25:04,326
Absolutely huge.

1298
01:25:04,388 --> 01:25:06,258
I was like, I don't believe this.

1299
01:25:06,344 --> 01:25:06,666
Okay.

1300
01:25:06,728 --> 01:25:09,582
And then here's how Clay Clarke's parts start.

1301
01:25:09,656 --> 01:25:10,110
Okay.

1302
01:25:10,220 --> 01:25:10,494
Hey.

1303
01:25:10,532 --> 01:25:13,642
Well, General Flynn and Peter Davaro, welcome on to the Owen shroyer.

1304
01:25:13,666 --> 01:25:14,634
And Alex Jones show.

1305
01:25:14,672 --> 01:25:16,340
Gentlemen, I appreciate you being here.

1306
01:25:16,910 --> 01:25:17,910
My brothers.

1307
01:25:18,290 --> 01:25:21,802
Hey, this is quite a duo to start things off for Clay.

1308
01:25:21,826 --> 01:25:29,770
Yeah, we all know Mike Flynn, but Peter Navarro isn't necessarily someone who's been on Alex's show in the past, or at least not to my knowledge.

1309
01:25:29,830 --> 01:25:34,570
Yeah, he was an aide within the Trump administration, and overall, he's basically a shithead.

1310
01:25:34,690 --> 01:25:40,602
He's currently facing contempt of Congress charges for refusing to comply with subpoenas and the investigation into January 6.

1311
01:25:40,616 --> 01:25:41,610
That's why I know his name.

1312
01:25:41,660 --> 01:25:51,922
He's also in hot water for conducting official government business on a private phone and then refusing to turn over records from that phone, insisting that he needs to be granted immunity before he'll do so twice.

1313
01:25:52,006 --> 01:25:54,762
Probably going to end up in jail before this whole thing is said and done.

1314
01:25:54,896 --> 01:26:01,002
Anyway, here we have a real QAnon adjacent, government overthrowing enthusiast panel happening.

1315
01:26:01,136 --> 01:26:05,840
Not quite sure what I expected from the war room, but I'm open to seeing where this goes.

1316
01:26:07,310 --> 01:26:10,506
That is a bold statement to come out with.

1317
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:17,286
We're welcoming General Flynn and Peter tomorrow, today, and it gets Better to have a fucking crazy talk.

1318
01:26:17,348 --> 01:26:18,786
Okay, here we go.

1319
01:26:18,908 --> 01:26:20,298
And we have Mike Lindell here.

1320
01:26:20,324 --> 01:26:26,902
Who what? What is happening? He always says this is the best buyer in America.

1321
01:26:26,986 --> 01:26:29,518
He's also passionate about exposing election fraud.

1322
01:26:29,554 --> 01:26:36,882
Joining us, Mike, we know that you three are going to somehow be in that White House serving once President Trump gets back.

1323
01:26:37,016 --> 01:26:42,610
What everybody in America needs to know right now as people are being discouraged and demoralized.

1324
01:26:42,790 --> 01:26:50,286
What would you like to say? What kind of encouragement would you want to share with the listeners, Mike? Well, the same thing I did on the stage here at CPAC this morning, everybody.

1325
01:26:50,408 --> 01:26:57,538
We've got all the tools you need to watch by August 20 and 21st is called the Moment of Truth Summit.

1326
01:26:57,634 --> 01:27:01,378
It'll be live stream at Frank speech for 48 hours straight.

1327
01:27:01,534 --> 01:27:03,862
This will change our country forever.

1328
01:27:03,946 --> 01:27:04,842
It's awesome.

1329
01:27:04,976 --> 01:27:16,086
So when the former president calls Mike Lindell the best ad buyer, what that translates to? Is he's a mark? He'll fund anything.

1330
01:27:16,208 --> 01:27:19,390
Yeah, I wouldn't want to be called the best ad buyer.

1331
01:27:19,510 --> 01:27:21,414
That is a dumb thing to call someone.

1332
01:27:21,452 --> 01:27:24,102
You better ask some real serious questions if someone calls you that.

1333
01:27:24,176 --> 01:27:32,070
Mike Lindell, he's starting to sound like a gravelyer older Jesse Ventura.

1334
01:27:32,450 --> 01:27:34,138
Well, they are both from Minnesota.

1335
01:27:34,174 --> 01:27:34,518
Right.

1336
01:27:34,604 --> 01:27:35,718
Okay, well, that makes sense.

1337
01:27:35,744 --> 01:27:35,862
Yeah.

1338
01:27:35,876 --> 01:27:37,858
I think he's got the speech pattern.

1339
01:27:37,894 --> 01:27:38,490
Yeah.

1340
01:27:38,660 --> 01:27:43,220
That comparison has been made by other people, I think I've heard in the past.

1341
01:27:43,970 --> 01:27:44,370
Yeah.

1342
01:27:44,420 --> 01:27:45,130
Mike Lindell.

1343
01:27:45,190 --> 01:27:46,942
Holy whoa.

1344
01:27:47,086 --> 01:27:49,950
So he just can't stop himself from doing these telephone.

1345
01:27:50,330 --> 01:27:52,122
And they always go bad in the middle.

1346
01:27:52,256 --> 01:27:56,542
The last one where he was going to prove that China stole the election was a complete disaster.

1347
01:27:56,566 --> 01:27:58,698
And this one is not going to go better.

1348
01:27:58,844 --> 01:28:03,606
I went to the website for this summit, and there's actually a really fitting image on the landing page.

1349
01:28:03,788 --> 01:28:05,562
It's Mike standing in.

1350
01:28:05,576 --> 01:28:08,194
Front of Mount Rushmore, waving an American flag.

1351
01:28:08,362 --> 01:28:20,780
Conveniently, he's obscuring Lincoln's face with that flag, something of a symbolic expression, intentional or not, of his and his movement's desire to rerun the Civil War and undo the whole emancipation thing.

1352
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:28,606
On day one of the summit, lindell is going to have a premiere screening of the film selection Code, which goes into how the election was stolen.

1353
01:28:28,738 --> 01:28:40,878
It was funded by Lindel and largely is about Tina Peters, who you may remember as the election fraud conspiracy, who was arrested for allegedly facilitating a security breach in May 2021.

1354
01:28:41,024 --> 01:28:49,950
She was a county clerk in Mesa, Arizona, and in her capacity there, she enabled data from the election to be leaked and ultimately published on a QAnon Telegram channel.

1355
01:28:50,120 --> 01:28:53,982
She recently lost an election she was in running for Secretary of State.

1356
01:28:54,116 --> 01:28:57,922
She lost in the GOP primary, only getting 27% of the vote.

1357
01:28:57,946 --> 01:29:02,814
But of course, she insists that she won and the election was stolen because why not? Yeah.

1358
01:29:02,912 --> 01:29:07,350
Anyway, Lindell paid to make a movie about her and he's airing it at his big summit.

1359
01:29:07,730 --> 01:29:12,726
Then on day two, we get something truly exciting that I might actually tune in for.

1360
01:29:12,848 --> 01:29:13,914
From 11:00 A.m.

1361
01:29:13,952 --> 01:29:21,430
To 06:30 p.m., we have the trial of the machines, except on the site they misspelled trial, so it actually says Trail of the Machine.

1362
01:29:21,490 --> 01:29:22,218
Oh, my God.

1363
01:29:22,304 --> 01:29:30,270
There's no explanation for this other than, quote, mike Lindell puts the voting machines on trial seven and a half hours.

1364
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:31,906
It's going to be madness.

1365
01:29:32,038 --> 01:29:38,994
Are you telling me that the boy Pope has dug up the old Pope and we are putting the Pope on the stand? Yes.

1366
01:29:39,092 --> 01:29:45,198
Okay, if you're Lindell's kid and by the way, I don't know if he has kids, but if he does have kids, he got to be pissed at you got to run.

1367
01:29:45,284 --> 01:29:59,794
He seems to have an endless supply of money to waste, but you got to know that eventually it's going to run out, and before your very eyes, your inheritance has turned into a two day vanity livestream with a seven hour fake courtroom scene where your dad pretends to indict a laptop.

1368
01:29:59,902 --> 01:30:01,710
It's grim stuff, man.

1369
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:03,898
Anyway, this is quite a panel of guests.

1370
01:30:03,934 --> 01:30:05,514
Owen feeling is put together.

1371
01:30:05,612 --> 01:30:13,098
Real bunch of top notch shitheads, that quote, we're going to see all of you in the White House when Trump gets back.

1372
01:30:13,124 --> 01:30:23,278
In the normal, corrupt world we've lived in for a long time, you're a big donor all of a sudden after you get elected, holy cow, you're ambassador to, like, Switzerland.

1373
01:30:23,374 --> 01:30:24,450
What a great job.

1374
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:27,870
Sure, we paid you off for giving us all the money.

1375
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:30,354
There's some corruption, but everybody lives their own life.

1376
01:30:30,452 --> 01:30:36,560
And if it's Mike Lindell and Trump is like, you're Treasury Secretary now, you're the best ad buyer I've ever seen.

1377
01:30:37,130 --> 01:30:40,438
Nobody can control the flow of money better than Linda.

1378
01:30:40,534 --> 01:30:42,978
What are we doing here? Oh, my God.

1379
01:30:43,064 --> 01:30:44,142
Sad times.

1380
01:30:44,336 --> 01:30:45,634
So Owen can't help himself.

1381
01:30:45,682 --> 01:30:46,940
He's got to pop in.

1382
01:30:47,570 --> 01:30:50,538
I'm like a fly on the wall in here listening to my own show.

1383
01:30:50,684 --> 01:30:53,298
The most meta day in Infowars history.

1384
01:30:53,384 --> 01:31:04,522
You had Alex Jones covering Alex Jones case live on the air, and now you have Owen Troyer listening to Owen Troy or show, it's not meta that's self indulgent and narcissistic.

1385
01:31:04,666 --> 01:31:08,970
It's not meta for Alex to complain about his own perceived victimhood on his show.

1386
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:11,326
It's just any other day on Infowars.

1387
01:31:11,458 --> 01:31:15,870
I understand Owen wanting to dress this up as something other than vanity, but that's all it is.

1388
01:31:15,980 --> 01:31:31,866
Also, I was poking around on that Reawaken America to our website because I was really bored during this interview, and I found that on September 24 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, they're putting on a comedy show with Jim Brewer that promises to be, quote, like a non communist version of Saturday Night Live.

1389
01:31:31,928 --> 01:31:32,782
Holy shit.

1390
01:31:32,866 --> 01:31:38,250
I know very little about SNL personally, but I don't think that the workers control the means of production there.

1391
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:39,740
Oh, boy.

1392
01:31:40,070 --> 01:31:46,626
From what I understand of the operations, I think says SNL is a pro fascist situation.

1393
01:31:46,748 --> 01:31:51,534
Lauren there's a character based around him.

1394
01:31:51,692 --> 01:31:52,940
Anyway, I don't know.

1395
01:31:54,110 --> 01:32:00,800
So the selling point of that show is, quote, see Jim Brewer as Biden for a night Joe Biden won't remember.

1396
01:32:01,190 --> 01:32:05,250
I guess the joke is that Biden's forgetful, but the joke kind of works the other way, too.

1397
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:08,060
Biden won't remember this because he'll never know about it.

1398
01:32:09,770 --> 01:32:15,150
He couldn't care less about some skits Jim Brewers doing in front of a bunch of Q and on aunts and uncles.

1399
01:32:15,710 --> 01:32:18,334
But also Jordan, you should try to get an opening.

1400
01:32:18,382 --> 01:32:23,022
I was going to say, if there's a spot, man, I can still do five.

1401
01:32:23,096 --> 01:32:24,570
I can still do five off.

1402
01:32:24,620 --> 01:32:25,434
Rattle it off.

1403
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:26,370
No big deal.

1404
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:30,270
I've seen brewers stand up and you could open for him.

1405
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:32,480
Oh, I could close for him.

1406
01:32:33,830 --> 01:32:34,158
Yeah.

1407
01:32:34,184 --> 01:32:36,078
You shouldn't know before too high.

1408
01:32:36,104 --> 01:32:37,422
I can't follow that.

1409
01:32:37,616 --> 01:32:39,030
It just makes noises.

1410
01:32:40,130 --> 01:32:48,630
But yeah, the flyer for this is fun because it has a picture of Jim Brewer in a gray wig, which I guess is his biden.

1411
01:32:49,010 --> 01:32:50,206
I am worried.

1412
01:32:50,338 --> 01:32:54,298
I'm worried for Swearing Carey, because now we've got a new biden in the mix.

1413
01:32:54,394 --> 01:32:54,906
Oh, no.

1414
01:32:54,968 --> 01:32:57,510
But this one's clearly a clone that's going wrong.

1415
01:32:57,560 --> 01:32:59,122
And it's also a guy named Jim.

1416
01:32:59,266 --> 01:33:04,110
Oh, see, everything is bigger than all Jim by ruin.

1417
01:33:05,570 --> 01:33:16,626
So, anyway, Owen pops in, and it's because there was an expectation that Alex is going to be on the War Room to talk about the whole thing once the damages came down.

1418
01:33:16,748 --> 01:33:20,394
And unfortunately, Alex will not be appearing on the War Room.

1419
01:33:20,552 --> 01:33:25,102
He had an appointment with three wise men, johnny, Jack, and Jim.

1420
01:33:25,246 --> 01:33:27,046
Not the Larynx Doctor.

1421
01:33:27,178 --> 01:33:28,410
The Whiskey Doctor.

1422
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:29,914
My favorite.

1423
01:33:29,962 --> 01:33:32,286
Yeah, he ain't going to be in today.

1424
01:33:32,348 --> 01:33:32,790
Oh, no.

1425
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:36,440
We're not going to be getting live comments from Alex at this time.

1426
01:33:36,830 --> 01:33:46,642
However, he is going to be issuing a response that will be directly uploaded to Van video.com.

1427
01:33:46,836 --> 01:33:50,086
So be on the lookout for that.

1428
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:52,654
I am on the lookout, and I found it.

1429
01:33:52,692 --> 01:33:54,130
Oh, I thought you might have.

1430
01:33:54,180 --> 01:33:54,790
Yeah.

1431
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:57,850
So this is an hour long video.

1432
01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:01,730
No, you don't need an hour to say fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1433
01:34:01,790 --> 01:34:02,906
Mostly commercial.

1434
01:34:03,038 --> 01:34:06,202
It's mostly just like, I want money, we need money.

1435
01:34:06,276 --> 01:34:06,778
Of course.

1436
01:34:06,864 --> 01:34:09,182
And Barnes.

1437
01:34:09,266 --> 01:34:10,222
Yeah, of course.

1438
01:34:10,296 --> 01:34:11,170
Well, you got it.

1439
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:13,800
Bobby Barnes is here.

1440
01:34:14,190 --> 01:34:16,142
And it's just whining.

1441
01:34:16,286 --> 01:34:26,210
This is an incredible time to be alive and to lay out how this show trial of the century that would make the Nazis blush is Robert Barnes.

1442
01:34:26,330 --> 01:34:26,738
Robert.

1443
01:34:26,774 --> 01:34:27,674
Simply incredible.

1444
01:34:27,782 --> 01:34:28,202
No doubt.

1445
01:34:28,226 --> 01:34:32,542
I mean, basically even the Soviets tried to make a show trial, at least a good show.

1446
01:34:32,616 --> 01:34:38,138
This was a show trial that was so one sided, so evidently partisan, so made for the movie scripts.

1447
01:34:38,234 --> 01:34:44,942
I was talking to Mark Robert the other day, and this is a Hollywood screenwriter, and even he was shocked to hear how it was basically designed.

1448
01:34:44,966 --> 01:34:53,974
The courtroom was designed like a set with three big movie cameras with the judge alternating what could be said and when it could be said and how it could be said.

1449
01:34:54,012 --> 01:34:58,058
And who could say it in such a way that had nothing to do with the rules of evidence.

1450
01:34:58,094 --> 01:35:00,002
Nothing to do with the rules of law in Texas.

1451
01:35:00,086 --> 01:35:02,486
Nothing to do with constitutional liberties and protection.

1452
01:35:02,558 --> 01:35:08,446
And everything to do with scripting a case so that it would have a particular outcome and in particular.

1453
01:35:08,568 --> 01:35:13,970
A future media narrative that could be fun and ultimately an actual future movie.

1454
01:35:14,090 --> 01:35:23,270
Do these guys know what the Nazis did? Like, the Nazis would blush at this trial? It's a little offensive.

1455
01:35:23,390 --> 01:35:23,782
Yeah.

1456
01:35:23,856 --> 01:35:28,274
Anyway, I was in the courtroom for a lot more of the case than media star Bobby Barnes.

1457
01:35:28,322 --> 01:35:35,150
And I can say very clearly and with no hesitation that the courtroom was not laid out like a movie set and it wasn't following the script.

1458
01:35:35,270 --> 01:35:39,146
I get that that's a convenient narrative for him and Alex to push because they lost.

1459
01:35:39,218 --> 01:35:41,390
And the fallout from this case is going to be spectacular.

1460
01:35:41,450 --> 01:35:45,130
But this is a weak attempt at damage control or whatever they're doing.

1461
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:51,526
For one thing, there were a few cameras in the courtroom, like I mentioned, but they weren't all the same people's cameras, right.

1462
01:35:51,588 --> 01:35:53,054
One was the court's zoom camera.

1463
01:35:53,102 --> 01:35:54,470
One was the Law and crime feed.

1464
01:35:54,530 --> 01:35:57,002
There were HBO cameras for the documentary.

1465
01:35:57,086 --> 01:36:05,890
And on that note, there was a sign on the door to the courtroom that advised people that there was a crew from HBO filming, and if they didn't consent to be in the background of shots, they shouldn't come in.

1466
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,802
Beyond that, there really wasn't much of an effect that the cameras had on the actual case.

1467
01:36:09,876 --> 01:36:25,238
No, the place where cameras were much more involved in making a scene relates to Alex's actions on the first tuesday, the first day of the case proper, alex held a mini press conference in the hallway for all the cameras, yelling about how he'd been railroad and how this is a show trial.

1468
01:36:25,334 --> 01:36:37,586
That was the video where we're standing in the background, if people remember that after being scolded about how that wasn't appropriate at lunch, alex tried to do it all again in front of the courthouse, but there was no one there to watch him have a tantrum.

1469
01:36:37,718 --> 01:36:40,118
Alex wanted a show trial vibe.

1470
01:36:40,214 --> 01:36:44,986
He wanted there to be tons of national media crews there covering the case, but he didn't get that.

1471
01:36:45,108 --> 01:36:56,498
I think it's instructive to understand that this complaint that there were all these cameras is actually expressing Alex and Barnes disappointment that there weren't cameras there that they could exploit for their own purposes.

1472
01:36:56,654 --> 01:37:03,418
It's less about the cameras and more about how they weren't able to control the narrative, which is something that they're fully used to being able to do.

1473
01:37:03,444 --> 01:37:15,394
Within the infowars bubble, a judge pushing back on that need for Alex to control all aspects of how he's allowed to speak or present himself is seen as her trying to create a false narrative which makes total sense.

1474
01:37:15,552 --> 01:37:24,190
Actual reality encroaching on the fake reality he lives in is experienced as an attack because it's the only way that fake reality can maintain its existence.

1475
01:37:27,730 --> 01:37:28,638
Lawyer.

1476
01:37:28,794 --> 01:37:51,070
If you're a lawyer, shouldn't I be allowed to play that clip before we get into a law argument or something? You know, like, if I'm a lawyer and Barnes is across the hall for me and he's on the other desk, shouldn't I be allowed to play that clip and be like, barnes is not taking law seriously, period.

1477
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:52,170
Not at all.

1478
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:54,526
This guy is not a lawyer.

1479
01:37:54,718 --> 01:37:56,166
Stop letting him law.

1480
01:37:56,288 --> 01:37:58,040
Just take law from him.

1481
01:37:59,330 --> 01:38:10,530
Look, I'm not involved in law, so I don't know what is and is not relevant for various things, but I would allow it if a lawyer is relevant to the law, I would assume.

1482
01:38:10,850 --> 01:38:17,298
Yeah, I would say, especially after this next clip, if you listen to this, you're like, you're not a serious person.

1483
01:38:17,444 --> 01:38:18,298
This is incredible.

1484
01:38:18,334 --> 01:38:25,122
Robert Barnes, continuing with your observations, both watching the trial on TV, being down there, having live coverage of it.

1485
01:38:25,136 --> 01:38:31,714
Why you say it's the most insane show trial ever? It is because, well, first of all, there pretty much wasn't a right that the judge didn't violate.

1486
01:38:31,762 --> 01:38:41,038
First amendment right of freedom of expression, freedom of association, freedom of the press, second amendment right to speak in favor of the second amendment right to selfdefense, fourth amendment right to privacy.

1487
01:38:41,074 --> 01:38:43,666
She violated that repeatedly throughout the proceedings.

1488
01:38:43,738 --> 01:39:02,230
Not only what went on in the discovery being unduly invasive, but in fact, turning over and telling the plaintiffs lawyer, you could turn over attorney client privileged communications protected by the fourth amendment to the January 6 committee or whomever else fifth amendment rights to due process of law, denied rights to bring motions to dismiss, antislapp motions, denied right to bring appeals.

1489
01:39:02,290 --> 01:39:12,054
You brought all of those judgment motions fixed both counsel and confrontation infringed by the attorney client privilege being disclosed and the right to confront those making accusations against you.

1490
01:39:12,152 --> 01:39:14,230
7th Amendment right to trial by jury.

1491
01:39:14,290 --> 01:39:19,446
And that means the right to trial by jury on all facts, not just the facts the judge decides can be tried.

1492
01:39:19,568 --> 01:39:26,578
And all of those same analogous federal constitutional provisions have analogs in the state constitution of the state of Texas.

1493
01:39:26,674 --> 01:39:30,514
Weren't these dudes laughing about the case a couple of hours ago? Like fake laughing.

1494
01:39:30,562 --> 01:39:33,560
It's weird how this judgment changed their mood a little bit.

1495
01:39:33,950 --> 01:39:37,854
I would like to give a rebuttal to Barnes's claims on the First Amendment front.

1496
01:39:37,892 --> 01:39:41,458
He gives no explanation for how the judge violated Alex's First Amendment rights.

1497
01:39:41,554 --> 01:39:42,906
He just asserts it as a fact.

1498
01:39:42,968 --> 01:39:56,070
And I contest that Barnes could never make that case in court, because if he could, you kind of expect he would still be Alex's lawyer, considering that was a huge part of Barnes argument back when he was Alex's lawyer on the Second Amendment side.

1499
01:39:56,120 --> 01:40:01,110
Is he saying that the judge didn't allow Alex to bring a gun into the courtroom? I'm unclear on this.

1500
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:10,774
I believe he's saying that by not allowing Alex to describe as his reasoning the Second Amendment, that is a violation of the Second Amendment.

1501
01:40:10,822 --> 01:40:13,146
No, because that's just the First Amendment thing all over again.

1502
01:40:13,208 --> 01:40:15,682
And it's not also a violation of the First Amendment.

1503
01:40:15,766 --> 01:40:16,674
I'm not saying it.

1504
01:40:16,712 --> 01:40:17,830
None of these rights are violated.

1505
01:40:17,890 --> 01:40:18,186
No.

1506
01:40:18,248 --> 01:40:21,942
I noticed that Barnes isn't accusing the judge of violating the Third Amendment, which is good.

1507
01:40:22,016 --> 01:40:25,210
I would hate to hear that Alex was forced to quarter any soldiers during the trial.

1508
01:40:25,270 --> 01:40:25,794
He was not.

1509
01:40:25,832 --> 01:40:31,806
And I don't know if he'd have any place for them to sleep considering all the spaces ridiculous team of security probably took up.

1510
01:40:31,988 --> 01:40:36,546
Judge Gamble didn't rule on whether or not Mark could turn over Alex's phone data.

1511
01:40:36,668 --> 01:40:39,654
She specifically said she wasn't going to get in the middle of that.

1512
01:40:39,752 --> 01:40:46,734
Either way, it's not an invasion of his privacy because it was accidentally disclosed by Alex's lawyer and Mark followed the proper channels before bringing it up.

1513
01:40:46,832 --> 01:40:50,862
If Mark had gotten the text through clandestine memes, then that would be a different story.

1514
01:40:50,936 --> 01:40:53,298
But this was Raynall fucking up.

1515
01:40:53,444 --> 01:40:59,494
Also, nothing about discovery, which Alex didn't even cooperate with, violated Alex's Fourth Amendment rights.

1516
01:40:59,542 --> 01:41:00,490
This is stupid.

1517
01:41:00,610 --> 01:41:02,758
Alex's fifth Amendment rights are fully intact.

1518
01:41:02,854 --> 01:41:07,410
He was not compelled to testify against himself and he had all the due process an asshole can get.

1519
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:11,238
He had every opportunity to participate in the case, but chose not to.

1520
01:41:11,384 --> 01:41:19,950
Civil and criminal courts cannot operate if people can just decide that they've made up in their mind that they've been jammed up so they don't have to participate in the case.

1521
01:41:20,060 --> 01:41:23,982
And any attempt to make them participate is actually the state railroading them.

1522
01:41:24,116 --> 01:41:30,646
Sometimes it does happen that innocent parties get caught up in protracted processes defending themselves, and that sucks.

1523
01:41:30,718 --> 01:41:37,302
But that's also why there are mechanisms in place to compensate people who have to go through that, and why you can countersue if you need to.

1524
01:41:37,436 --> 01:41:49,378
The 6th Amendment doesn't apply since it's about criminal cases, and the 7th Amendment only requires jury trials for civil cases in federal courts, and this is in the state court, and Barnes is saying that there are analogs in state court.

1525
01:41:49,414 --> 01:41:52,062
Then why are you talking about the Constitution, dumb dumb? Good call.

1526
01:41:52,136 --> 01:41:53,194
Barnes is a lawyer.

1527
01:41:53,242 --> 01:41:55,002
He should know better, and he does.

1528
01:41:55,076 --> 01:41:56,346
He just doesn't care.

1529
01:41:56,468 --> 01:41:57,418
He's not a lawyer.

1530
01:41:57,454 --> 01:42:04,218
He's someone who knows law stuff and is happy to use that law stuff to justify right wing idiots on shows like this.

1531
01:42:04,304 --> 01:42:06,570
And his own podcast with Viva Fry.

1532
01:42:06,890 --> 01:42:07,734
Small point.

1533
01:42:07,832 --> 01:42:12,846
The guy who tried to storm the Ohio FBI office allegedly posted this on Truth Social.

1534
01:42:12,968 --> 01:42:19,398
Quote, I'm having trouble getting information, but Viva Fry said, patriots are heading to Palm Beach where Mara Lago is.

1535
01:42:19,484 --> 01:42:23,778
I recommend going and being Florida, I think the Feds won't break it up.

1536
01:42:23,864 --> 01:42:25,530
If they do, kill them.

1537
01:42:25,700 --> 01:42:32,106
If I were Barnes and I really wanted to evoke an amendment for Alex, I would go with the 18th.

1538
01:42:32,228 --> 01:42:39,690
Now, sure, that was repealed by the 21st Amendment, but if there was ever a right Alex could use right about now, it's the prohibition of alcohol.

1539
01:42:40,130 --> 01:42:45,190
See that? Yes, it was very clever.

1540
01:42:45,250 --> 01:42:46,314
Yeah, I'll give you that.

1541
01:42:46,352 --> 01:42:48,210
Yeah, calm down with the booze, Alex.

1542
01:42:50,450 --> 01:43:05,578
It's so annoying when people are like, we're more polarized than ever, but there is an argument to be made that somehow more amendments were passed after or before Prohibition was repealed.

1543
01:43:05,614 --> 01:43:18,826
Do you know what I'm saying? Like, everybody agreed that prohibition was a bad idea once it happened, and then they still managed to agree on two more amendments before they could agree on repealing prohibition.

1544
01:43:18,958 --> 01:43:21,606
We couldn't get half an amendment pass through now.

1545
01:43:21,668 --> 01:43:22,530
No, probably not.

1546
01:43:22,580 --> 01:43:25,450
And the only one I would guarantee is Prohibition.

1547
01:43:25,570 --> 01:43:28,820
We could absolutely repeal Prohibition today.

1548
01:43:30,530 --> 01:43:31,700
I bet we could.

1549
01:43:32,630 --> 01:43:33,834
I would take that back.

1550
01:43:33,932 --> 01:43:34,710
You might be right.

1551
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:35,840
You might be right.

1552
01:43:36,590 --> 01:43:41,250
So, look, Barnes, like I said, shit head, dumb dumb.

1553
01:43:42,170 --> 01:43:45,390
I'll repeat, that no reason I will double down.

1554
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:46,230
I've said worst words.

1555
01:43:46,280 --> 01:43:50,334
If the same standard was applied to Axios, that was applied to you.

1556
01:43:50,432 --> 01:43:57,342
They could be sued into bankruptcy tomorrow by running a headline that says, the View of Aldi questions whether or not there's a school shooting cover up.

1557
01:43:57,416 --> 01:44:01,954
Because, to be clear, they didn't limit this case to just one or two specific statements.

1558
01:44:02,002 --> 01:44:09,970
They said any statement questioning anything concerning the Sandy Hook official narrative warranted a death penalty.

1559
01:44:10,030 --> 01:44:17,674
They gave you a death penalty sanction in the default judgment stage, then gave you another, and they asked for a death penalty sanction from the jury and the punitive damages.

1560
01:44:17,722 --> 01:44:22,710
Stage Barnes is a total shithead and a liar, but he doesn't actually believe what he's saying.

1561
01:44:22,820 --> 01:44:27,118
He's also not so dumb as to be unaware that what he's saying is a lie.

1562
01:44:27,214 --> 01:44:31,390
Obviously, this case absolutely did not include any supposition.

1563
01:44:31,450 --> 01:44:35,098
The questioning aspects of public events constituted defamation.

1564
01:44:35,254 --> 01:44:46,242
The reason that it might appear that way if you're not paying attention is because the plaintiffs attorneys brought up a ton of instances of Alex repeating and defending talking points that he had used to argue that the shooting never happened.

1565
01:44:46,376 --> 01:44:49,914
Long after he claims, he stopped arguing that it didn't happen.

1566
01:44:50,072 --> 01:44:54,260
In fact, Alex was repeating those claims in the middle of his supposed apology video.

1567
01:44:54,770 --> 01:45:14,170
Imagine this scenario using one of Alex's bullshit claims from the Sandy Hook Times, which he got from how big and Fetzer and continued to repeat long after supposedly realizing the shooting happened, right? Imagine you see online that people are claiming that the school wasn't even open and there was no internet traffic to the school's website in the year before the shooting.

1568
01:45:14,290 --> 01:45:25,774
You would be totally free to discuss this claim that people were making online, and hopefully you would have the decency to take like five minutes to look into it and see that it's bullshit before going on air and mindlessly repeating the claim.

1569
01:45:25,882 --> 01:45:31,246
But even so, if you repeat it as a question that folks have, you aren't committing defamation.

1570
01:45:31,438 --> 01:45:33,282
This isn't what Alex did.

1571
01:45:33,416 --> 01:45:45,774
He used these alleged anomalies as a pile of evidence that he would drop on the audience to support his claim that the shooting didn't happen, when the plaintiff's attorneys would demonstrate that he was still making these claims in the fairly recent past.

1572
01:45:45,872 --> 01:45:50,074
What they're doing is illustrating that he's still making the same arguments.

1573
01:45:50,242 --> 01:45:58,470
To deconstruct this a little bit, Alex was making the argument if the school's website got no traffic, then the school wasn't open.

1574
01:45:58,580 --> 01:46:05,034
If the school wasn't open, the shooting could not have happened, therefore the shooting didn't happen.

1575
01:46:05,192 --> 01:46:07,914
It's essentially a setup of if A, then B.

1576
01:46:08,012 --> 01:46:10,782
If B, then C A, therefore C.

1577
01:46:10,916 --> 01:46:15,454
It's a perfectly fine construction for an argument and it's called a hypothetical syllogism.

1578
01:46:15,562 --> 01:46:19,818
And assuming all your premises are correct, it follows that your conclusion will be as.

1579
01:46:19,844 --> 01:46:30,106
Well, when Alex has made the argument repeatedly on the show, the audience understands that A is proof of see whether or not they understand this logic path.

1580
01:46:30,238 --> 01:46:40,062
So when Alex is claiming he believes the shooting happened, but then still insisting the premise A is correct, what he's doing is still affirming the conclusion while pretending that he's not.

1581
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:43,446
This is one of the ways that Alex has his cake and eats it too.

1582
01:46:43,508 --> 01:46:46,940
Or as Mark said it in the trial, he wants it always.

1583
01:46:47,390 --> 01:46:50,350
If you pay attention to his show, you'll see a bit of this behavior.

1584
01:46:50,410 --> 01:46:58,974
And in the case of Sandy Hook, you can plug in a bunch of different narratives in that place for Premise A, and it works the same paramedics weren't allowed in the building.

1585
01:46:59,072 --> 01:47:00,574
Kids walked around in circles.

1586
01:47:00,622 --> 01:47:04,410
FBI crime stats say no murders happened in Newtown that year.

1587
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:10,030
All of these things are the first premises for that hypothetical syllogism structure.

1588
01:47:10,210 --> 01:47:13,614
Barnes understands this, and on some level, Alex does, too.

1589
01:47:13,652 --> 01:47:20,242
But even leaving that aside, alex's actions as it relates to Sandy Hook are so much worse than just making claims publicly.

1590
01:47:20,386 --> 01:47:34,134
His promotion of Wolfgang Halbig after the point where he could be reasonably expected to know that Wolfgang was harassing victims family members, including Scarlett Lewis, is something that you might notice barnes doesn't even touch.

1591
01:47:34,292 --> 01:47:42,390
The defense of Alex is grandstanding, and that grandstanding only works if you have a straw man version of the accusation that you need to defend yourself against.

1592
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:45,946
And Barnes knows all this? He's a total shit.

1593
01:47:46,018 --> 01:48:02,454
Yeah, it reminds me of my favorite moment in the trial was when I believe Reynald was questioning, and then there was this massive objection storm, because his questioning was really terrible and obviously against the rules and stuff.

1594
01:48:02,552 --> 01:48:09,246
So the judge shuts him down, and then they have to have a sidebar, and Reynall afterwards claims he's like, here's the problem.

1595
01:48:09,368 --> 01:48:13,570
This is a sanction by the court because they made us look dumb.

1596
01:48:13,690 --> 01:48:17,060
And then the judge said, Only you can do that.

1597
01:48:17,870 --> 01:48:20,238
That is exactly how I feel about Barnes right now.

1598
01:48:20,264 --> 01:48:25,390
He's like, the court is doing all this stuff the court is doing, only you make yourself look dumb.

1599
01:48:25,450 --> 01:48:26,670
That's what's happening, man.

1600
01:48:26,780 --> 01:48:27,920
You are the one.

1601
01:48:28,910 --> 01:48:31,458
And you sound a little desperate, too.

1602
01:48:31,544 --> 01:48:37,306
You're making yourself sound a little desperate by way of how much this is just an infomercial.

1603
01:48:37,378 --> 01:48:37,830
Yes.

1604
01:48:37,940 --> 01:48:46,770
I'm quite frankly surprised, because listeners are so used to us being steadfast, so used to us being resilient, that they're like, okay, well, Jones has said he's close to oblivion quite a bit.

1605
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:49,866
We're getting a little extra support, but not what we should.

1606
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:56,670
And I think if it becomes evident where we actually do start shutting down, we'll have a lot of support, and then we'll try to reorganize and do something.

1607
01:48:56,720 --> 01:48:58,290
But now's the time of support.

1608
01:48:58,340 --> 01:48:59,542
Have you ever worked? Oh, no doubt.

1609
01:48:59,566 --> 01:49:03,466
Because this is what keeps info live on a monthly basis that pays all the salaries.

1610
01:49:03,598 --> 01:49:07,158
I don't understand why he's still doing commercials while they're planning to sue him.

1611
01:49:07,184 --> 01:49:08,130
Allegedly.

1612
01:49:10,530 --> 01:49:11,602
I kind of do understand.

1613
01:49:11,676 --> 01:49:13,680
It's all nonsense, for sure.

1614
01:49:14,010 --> 01:49:24,506
Anyway, the conversation of Alex's phone comes up, and there's a little bit of a defense being played here about the idea that there are intimate photos.

1615
01:49:24,638 --> 01:49:27,134
Oh, there's a little defensive being played.

1616
01:49:27,182 --> 01:49:29,602
Alex is a little defensive, let me tell you.

1617
01:49:29,676 --> 01:49:38,698
These people with their statements gave me more energy I've ever had it's on, even though they have the phone and the secret contacts with Vlad, and we're supposed to be going over to Moscow soon or whatever.

1618
01:49:38,784 --> 01:49:40,690
Oh, I'm going to play more of their clips.

1619
01:49:41,310 --> 01:49:42,550
Let's talk about that.

1620
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:47,506
It's six months of my phone, late 2019, early 2020.

1621
01:49:47,628 --> 01:49:52,810
It's some CPAC stuff, and it's pictures of my wife and me and the kids and stuff like that.

1622
01:49:52,980 --> 01:49:57,014
And I gave Texas and I gave Connecticut the phones.

1623
01:49:57,122 --> 01:49:58,630
They were searching them in six months.

1624
01:49:58,680 --> 01:49:59,590
Tranches.

1625
01:49:59,970 --> 01:50:04,930
And the paralegal left, like, a six month raw thing in there.

1626
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:05,962
And we all went through it.

1627
01:50:05,976 --> 01:50:07,102
There's nothing there.

1628
01:50:07,296 --> 01:50:08,942
We did anything wrong anyways.

1629
01:50:09,086 --> 01:50:11,014
And he's like, we have two years.

1630
01:50:11,052 --> 01:50:12,166
We have the whole phone.

1631
01:50:12,228 --> 01:50:13,222
That was not true.

1632
01:50:13,356 --> 01:50:19,080
Yeah, like, they have Hunter Biden's laptop, and, of course, where's the crack pipes, where's the horse sorry.

1633
01:50:20,310 --> 01:50:22,970
There was a photo I sent my wife of her naked.

1634
01:50:23,030 --> 01:50:23,254
Okay.

1635
01:50:23,292 --> 01:50:24,300
They got that.

1636
01:50:24,810 --> 01:50:25,798
My wife was pretty good.

1637
01:50:25,824 --> 01:50:26,386
Go ahead.

1638
01:50:26,508 --> 01:50:31,942
The point is that there's one naked picture of my wife in there, so that's what they've got.

1639
01:50:32,076 --> 01:50:35,520
And it's just no dick pics, no nothing.

1640
01:50:38,530 --> 01:50:40,070
This is uncomfortable.

1641
01:50:41,530 --> 01:50:43,780
I wouldn't put this out.

1642
01:50:44,830 --> 01:50:46,946
Just don't put your business like that out.

1643
01:50:47,068 --> 01:50:50,562
Let Mark tell people that you're a shitty person on top of a monster.

1644
01:50:50,646 --> 01:50:53,370
I will say this with absolute certainty.

1645
01:50:53,550 --> 01:51:02,406
Nobody who has access to that phone that I'm aware of would ever release naked pictures.

1646
01:51:02,598 --> 01:51:07,358
Even if it's like a dick pic of Alexes that could hypothetically be on the phone.

1647
01:51:07,504 --> 01:51:10,830
That is so uncalled for and inappropriate.

1648
01:51:10,890 --> 01:51:16,874
No, I mean, Alex could just not say anything, and this would never be an issue.

1649
01:51:16,972 --> 01:51:17,466
Morally.

1650
01:51:17,538 --> 01:51:24,350
It is a horrific thing to do to send a picture of somebody that's not Alex to somebody else.

1651
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:35,562
Alex is adding information to this that is making it, hey, you could have said it, and then you didn't have to add the part where you're saying, I sent it to a third party without consent.

1652
01:51:35,646 --> 01:51:37,698
Well, he's trying to maybe he got consent.

1653
01:51:37,734 --> 01:51:38,306
I don't know.

1654
01:51:38,368 --> 01:51:38,870
I don't know.

1655
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:43,242
No, because Alex is trying to say that he just sent a naked picture of his wife to his wife.

1656
01:51:43,326 --> 01:51:50,190
I think if you follow what he's saying yeah, but I think I'm going to go with Marc told the real version.

1657
01:51:50,310 --> 01:51:51,806
Well, I don't know.

1658
01:51:51,868 --> 01:51:52,720
We'll see.

1659
01:51:53,230 --> 01:51:54,314
We won't see.

1660
01:51:54,412 --> 01:51:56,114
No, we absolutely won't see.

1661
01:51:56,212 --> 01:51:58,754
We will never see this, and thank God for that.

1662
01:51:58,792 --> 01:52:03,134
Yeah, because honestly, more importantly, is, like, the stuff that means something.

1663
01:52:03,232 --> 01:52:07,830
Like the Paul Joseph Watson text that was absolutely shown in court.

1664
01:52:07,890 --> 01:52:08,438
Absolutely.

1665
01:52:08,584 --> 01:52:11,918
Here barnes and Alex intentionally missed the point.

1666
01:52:12,064 --> 01:52:22,814
Yeah, it's more fake news, and it's an attempt to sort I mean, what's extraordinary is they got to see a microscopic up close view of Infowars and Alex Jones, and they couldn't produce any incriminatory information.

1667
01:52:22,912 --> 01:52:27,926
That's why they had one text message about Paul saying, this looks like a BS sandy Hook store.

1668
01:52:28,108 --> 01:52:28,490
Exactly.

1669
01:52:28,540 --> 01:52:30,282
Which had nothing to do with Sandy Hook.

1670
01:52:30,306 --> 01:52:30,954
That's our smoke.

1671
01:52:31,002 --> 01:52:32,486
Oh, we have your phone.

1672
01:52:32,608 --> 01:52:34,022
And here it is.

1673
01:52:34,156 --> 01:52:34,850
Completely.

1674
01:52:35,020 --> 01:52:37,686
There's no basis of a criminal case whatsoever.

1675
01:52:37,758 --> 01:52:38,658
There's no perjury.

1676
01:52:38,694 --> 01:52:39,630
There's no lie.

1677
01:52:39,750 --> 01:52:40,706
So there's two things.

1678
01:52:40,768 --> 01:52:53,882
The first is that text from Paul illustrates that Alex has awareness that the story that he was doing about COVID was bullshit and it was Sandy Hook all over again.

1679
01:52:53,956 --> 01:52:56,066
And Alex admitted I get it.

1680
01:52:56,128 --> 01:52:58,694
I understand that this is what we're doing, and I don't care.

1681
01:52:58,792 --> 01:52:59,630
We're doing this.

1682
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:00,254
Yes.

1683
01:53:00,412 --> 01:53:16,240
The second thing is that the existence of this text is full evidence that Alex did commit perjury when he said that he had looked through his phone and turned over everything that had the word Sandy Hook in them because this existed and was not turned over.

1684
01:53:16,870 --> 01:53:18,746
That is a problem.

1685
01:53:18,808 --> 01:53:23,130
They're just completely missing the point and saying it didn't even involve Sandy Hook.

1686
01:53:23,190 --> 01:53:23,990
That is correct.

1687
01:53:24,100 --> 01:53:27,002
But those words were there because of that.

1688
01:53:27,076 --> 01:53:27,686
It's an issue.

1689
01:53:27,748 --> 01:53:28,910
You're in hot water.

1690
01:53:29,080 --> 01:53:35,630
If those words were in there and you search your phone, you would have found that text and you specifically chose not to give it to us.

1691
01:53:35,680 --> 01:53:36,110
Yeah.

1692
01:53:36,220 --> 01:53:39,290
Now, Barb is one of the great legal minds of Infowars.

1693
01:53:40,030 --> 01:53:49,838
It's very clear from this appearance if that is true, and only a great legal mind could come up with an argument like this about why everything on Alex's phone is totally cool.

1694
01:53:49,984 --> 01:53:50,958
They go intimate.

1695
01:53:50,994 --> 01:53:52,238
Roger Stone text.

1696
01:53:52,384 --> 01:53:55,622
It's like Roger saying, yeah, my wife fell and broke her leg.

1697
01:53:55,756 --> 01:53:56,786
God, it's hard.

1698
01:53:56,908 --> 01:53:59,042
Somebody just beat us up in the parking lot.

1699
01:53:59,176 --> 01:54:00,626
I'm like, I'm so sorry, man.

1700
01:54:00,688 --> 01:54:01,782
And that's intimate.

1701
01:54:01,866 --> 01:54:02,114
Yeah.

1702
01:54:02,152 --> 01:54:02,726
I know.

1703
01:54:02,848 --> 01:54:03,902
All of us.

1704
01:54:04,096 --> 01:54:08,466
If there was anything there, it would be on the front page of CNN, the New York Times, and every welfare.

1705
01:54:08,478 --> 01:54:11,046
It would have already been fully disclosed and revealed and released.

1706
01:54:11,118 --> 01:54:13,382
If there isn't anything there, it's like Trump.

1707
01:54:13,516 --> 01:54:20,354
They get to do a macroscopic microscopic look at your entire life and all they can come up with is pretty much nothing.

1708
01:54:20,452 --> 01:54:22,010
So that's bad reasoning.

1709
01:54:22,450 --> 01:54:28,146
The fact that there isn't anything that's been revealed means there's nothing to reveal.

1710
01:54:28,218 --> 01:54:28,840
Right.

1711
01:54:29,770 --> 01:54:33,714
I guess that works now, but that may not work eventually.

1712
01:54:33,822 --> 01:54:43,794
I mean, his argument, unfortunately, the way he put it, is essentially I didn't get caught robbing that bank, so I didn't rob that bank.

1713
01:54:43,842 --> 01:54:44,054
Yeah.

1714
01:54:44,092 --> 01:54:45,422
Haven't been arrested yet.

1715
01:54:45,616 --> 01:54:46,638
I'm gold.

1716
01:54:46,794 --> 01:54:54,440
If they knew I'd rob the bank, then they would have arrested smart legal mind.

1717
01:54:54,890 --> 01:54:59,086
Not to be outdone by Alex accusing everyone of being a pedophile.

1718
01:54:59,158 --> 01:54:59,862
Right.

1719
01:55:00,056 --> 01:55:01,762
Barnes decides to get in the mix.

1720
01:55:01,846 --> 01:55:02,166
Wow.

1721
01:55:02,228 --> 01:55:03,442
And a fever.

1722
01:55:03,526 --> 01:55:08,554
And he accuses, by implication, Mark of being a pedophile.

1723
01:55:08,602 --> 01:55:09,030
Great.

1724
01:55:09,140 --> 01:55:15,294
And that's also going to have to take into account what the Lafferty claims are valued at and the Posner claims are valued at and the Fontaine claims are valued at.

1725
01:55:15,392 --> 01:55:24,118
And that is why I've been saying that what this is Coin heading towards is there is going to be a large set of plaintiffs who are going to be dividing up the corpse of Infowars.

1726
01:55:24,154 --> 01:55:25,282
In the bankruptcy estate.

1727
01:55:25,366 --> 01:55:28,914
And over the course of that process, that could get very dangerous for Mr.

1728
01:55:28,952 --> 01:55:33,118
Jones because there is going to be a new level of financial street.

1729
01:55:33,274 --> 01:55:44,720
And if some lawyer like me can basically find out that he's hiding the keys to the Candy store, pull it out in front of him on the stand, I can only imagine what Federal Reserve is going to do.

1730
01:55:45,170 --> 01:55:47,660
So, yeah, it's going to get interesting from here on out.

1731
01:55:48,410 --> 01:55:51,894
They think Info Wars is the candy store.

1732
01:55:52,052 --> 01:55:53,480
Well, you can tell.

1733
01:55:54,770 --> 01:55:59,982
I don't say what comes to mind, but I mean, the point is that you've seen the finances here.

1734
01:55:59,996 --> 01:56:01,126
It's so funny.

1735
01:56:01,318 --> 01:56:06,474
They're drilling to dry well and they just can't imagine that they project the stuff onto us.

1736
01:56:06,512 --> 01:56:12,738
But what do you make of those claims? I think there was definitely some confession through projection there.

1737
01:56:12,764 --> 01:56:14,694
The way his eyes lit up at Candy Store.

1738
01:56:14,792 --> 01:56:16,818
I don't want to know why he goes to a candy store.

1739
01:56:16,844 --> 01:56:17,960
I'll put it that way.

1740
01:56:18,590 --> 01:56:19,278
Wow.

1741
01:56:19,424 --> 01:56:31,302
For somebody who got his ask wiped by Mark in every possible way whenever he was involved legally, it is a lot easier to make fun of him.

1742
01:56:31,316 --> 01:56:37,786
When you're on a talk show and he's not anywhere near, you can be confession by projections.

1743
01:56:37,858 --> 01:56:39,846
Another one you should write down that's another.

1744
01:56:40,028 --> 01:56:41,670
It's like the blank end blank.

1745
01:56:42,590 --> 01:56:44,240
I'll give you a point on that one.

1746
01:56:46,130 --> 01:56:47,850
I'll give you a point for that one.

1747
01:56:48,020 --> 01:56:52,126
So Alex actually makes a really good point here about some of Mark's comments.

1748
01:56:52,198 --> 01:56:52,820
Okay.

1749
01:56:53,690 --> 01:56:59,194
Particularly the comment that we have a bunch of plaintiffs that are going to be splitting up the corpse of Infowars.

1750
01:56:59,242 --> 01:56:59,778
Right.

1751
01:56:59,924 --> 01:57:01,700
Alex makes a great point here.

1752
01:57:03,050 --> 01:57:04,866
I have mixed feelings about it.

1753
01:57:04,988 --> 01:57:05,862
Well, that's the thing.

1754
01:57:05,936 --> 01:57:11,730
If I wanted my enemies to fight me, I would say, I will destroy you.

1755
01:57:11,780 --> 01:57:12,366
You're over.

1756
01:57:12,428 --> 01:57:14,058
I'm going to dominate you.

1757
01:57:14,204 --> 01:57:15,690
Like when you said that.

1758
01:57:15,860 --> 01:57:23,250
Don't they know what they're doing? Do they not know the gold with our audience? Them saying, we're going to cut up his corpse.

1759
01:57:23,570 --> 01:57:27,018
We're going to shut them down, we're going to shut all these Americans down.

1760
01:57:27,104 --> 01:57:32,960
They literally just declared war on the middle class in America and the Midwest completely.

1761
01:57:33,410 --> 01:57:47,902
What Alex is saying here could be translated as, don't these people understand how much I'm going to be able to fundraise off a quote like that? Alex's business model operates off fear, and he's able to monetize his ability to capture the audience in a state of fear.

1762
01:57:48,046 --> 01:58:01,150
When there's a statement like Marks, which can be translated as a direct attack on Alex, alex can repackage that as an attack on the audience, which will allow him to more easily fleece some of them into continuing to throw money into the pit that is Infowars.

1763
01:58:01,210 --> 01:58:01,650
Right.

1764
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:06,334
Alex is laughing because he feels that Mark has made his job of raising money easier.

1765
01:58:06,382 --> 01:58:15,018
But there's a larger reality that Alex is trying to distract away from, which is that no matter what he does, there's a sort of damocles hanging over his head.

1766
01:58:15,164 --> 01:58:19,810
All the posturing and fundraising isn't really going to matter much to a bankruptcy audit.

1767
01:58:19,870 --> 01:58:22,734
And when you step into that arena, it's not a civil matter.

1768
01:58:22,772 --> 01:58:28,446
If you try to play games, you could end up going to jail for the sort of crimes you end up pulling there.

1769
01:58:28,628 --> 01:58:35,098
And you have to consider what could come with a very clear cases of perjury that Alex was caught committing in the course of the trial.

1770
01:58:35,194 --> 01:58:42,946
I don't know any of the specifics, but I wouldn't be surprised if that was something that could lead to huge fines or possibly even be referred for prosecution.

1771
01:58:43,138 --> 01:58:55,350
Alex can do this song and dance with Barnes all they want, and it's fun for him to pretend that he's won this trial, but in order to do that, he has to pretend a whole tranche of other problems don't exist and aren't nipping at his heels.

1772
01:58:56,930 --> 01:58:58,426
It's a grim picture.

1773
01:58:58,558 --> 01:58:58,962
Yeah.

1774
01:58:59,036 --> 01:59:07,400
I mean, I don't know how to deal with whenever you find out somebody perjured themselves on the stand when they're still on the stand.

1775
01:59:08,210 --> 01:59:14,540
I feel like that's almost a moment where the whole thing should, like, the light should turn off.

1776
01:59:15,110 --> 01:59:16,880
You should be able to run away.

1777
01:59:19,790 --> 01:59:23,766
There's no way because it cannot just be like, later on he gets a fine.

1778
01:59:23,828 --> 01:59:25,470
That cannot be the case.

1779
01:59:25,580 --> 01:59:36,778
You can't tell me that I could just go and lie to a judge and then pay $1,000, relatively speaking, you know what I'm saying? Like, that cannot be okay.

1780
01:59:36,924 --> 01:59:37,826
It just can't.

1781
01:59:37,898 --> 01:59:38,700
I agree.

1782
01:59:39,090 --> 01:59:44,546
But I also think you should be able to I think you should have to run well, I think you should have to have a smoke bomb.

1783
01:59:44,618 --> 01:59:46,238
No smoke bombs.

1784
01:59:46,394 --> 01:59:49,694
You have to evade the court officers.

1785
01:59:49,742 --> 01:59:50,098
Yeah.

1786
01:59:50,184 --> 01:59:51,754
You got to jump your way out, then you get out.

1787
01:59:51,792 --> 01:59:51,994
Yeah.

1788
01:59:52,032 --> 01:59:53,782
But if not, you got to come back to the city.

1789
01:59:53,796 --> 01:59:55,574
Then it turns into American Gladiators.

1790
01:59:55,622 --> 01:59:59,002
And if you make it through the hole, then you win fast.

1791
01:59:59,076 --> 02:00:01,570
Thunder jets.

1792
02:00:02,310 --> 02:00:03,730
I got you, boulder.

1793
02:00:04,590 --> 02:00:05,222
Turbo.

1794
02:00:05,306 --> 02:00:05,978
Turbo.

1795
02:00:06,134 --> 02:00:07,618
Turbo is definitely one of them.

1796
02:00:07,704 --> 02:00:12,034
So Barnes believes it's going to go to the Texas Supreme Court, maybe the US.

1797
02:00:12,072 --> 02:00:18,540
Supreme Court, and he has some really fun ways of expressing how close they are to winning cases like that.

1798
02:00:18,870 --> 02:00:20,686
This is a bondable judgment we'll go up to.

1799
02:00:20,688 --> 02:00:27,554
The Texas Supreme Court will be decided by them at some point in the process, and if the Texas Supreme Court gets involved, it's game over for the plaintiffs.

1800
02:00:27,602 --> 02:00:28,898
They throw out the case entirely.

1801
02:00:28,934 --> 02:00:43,186
We already had, like, half of one short and a half, only one justice short of them taking it and throwing this out from the very beginning because the very nature of the suit violates the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, always has.

1802
02:00:43,248 --> 02:00:47,462
Also violates Texas law on the definition of intentional infliction of emotional distress.

1803
02:00:47,546 --> 02:00:47,878
Oh, man.

1804
02:00:47,904 --> 02:00:49,598
That's a really fun way to say you lost.

1805
02:00:49,694 --> 02:00:50,062
Yeah.

1806
02:00:50,136 --> 02:00:51,874
One justice short of half.

1807
02:00:52,032 --> 02:00:52,740
Wow.

1808
02:00:53,790 --> 02:00:58,680
I'd be like, what do you think? You're not going to still be one just as short of half.

1809
02:00:59,490 --> 02:01:20,450
Have you changed the Supreme Court of Texas? Honestly, I really don't even think they'll get that just as short of half, because they're not remembering that despite them being conservatives, the Texas Supreme Court or whatever, despite their strong conservative leanings, et cetera, these people are still lawyers and judges and shit.

1810
02:01:20,570 --> 02:01:20,962
True.

1811
02:01:21,036 --> 02:01:33,478
And I imagine that when they start looking at somebody abusing the court system the way Alex did, even though they're like, I'll lick Trump's feet, they're still going to be like, we got to take this guy.

1812
02:01:33,504 --> 02:01:34,982
Can't be doing that shit.

1813
02:01:35,126 --> 02:01:43,130
And if they review the entirety of the case, you might be like, well, we got to take this, like, this perjury stuff a little more seriously.

1814
02:01:43,250 --> 02:01:44,690
It could backfire.

1815
02:01:44,750 --> 02:01:45,360
Yes.

1816
02:01:46,050 --> 02:01:46,654
Maybe not.

1817
02:01:46,692 --> 02:01:47,242
I don't know.

1818
02:01:47,316 --> 02:01:57,142
Anyway, the point is, we're coming to the end of this special report because it's mostly just rambling about how it's just the same shit repeated over and over again, over and over again.

1819
02:01:57,156 --> 02:02:00,026
I want them to talk about cannibalism and reanimating spiders.

1820
02:02:00,098 --> 02:02:00,706
That was great.

1821
02:02:00,768 --> 02:02:01,750
That was fun.

1822
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:05,038
You could grasp something with the spider just with air.

1823
02:02:05,124 --> 02:02:05,446
Yeah.

1824
02:02:05,508 --> 02:02:12,058
Whose idea was that? Some weirdo at Rice? That's a question that I don't think anybody explained fully to me.

1825
02:02:12,204 --> 02:02:15,350
The guy who was like and nobody was like, I was drunk.

1826
02:02:15,410 --> 02:02:16,258
Nobody's saying that.

1827
02:02:16,284 --> 02:02:20,122
I was watching a video on the lady who was like the grad student who was working on it.

1828
02:02:20,256 --> 02:02:22,858
We thought we might be able to do it, and we just put the needle into work.

1829
02:02:22,884 --> 02:02:23,494
The first time.

1830
02:02:23,532 --> 02:02:26,554
I was like, what the fuck? Okay, cool.

1831
02:02:26,652 --> 02:02:28,020
That is great.

1832
02:02:29,070 --> 02:02:32,578
We were like, hey, what if we could do this? Let's do it.

1833
02:02:32,724 --> 02:02:34,800
I was on toad the other day.

1834
02:02:36,510 --> 02:02:40,860
Spiders kind of look like a okay, all right.

1835
02:02:41,970 --> 02:02:48,430
So we're coming to the end of this, and of course, we're going to have to dismount on some salesmanship.

1836
02:02:48,930 --> 02:02:53,042
But also, hey, man, you got to understand that Alex is a hero.

1837
02:02:53,186 --> 02:02:54,310
I don't know if that's true.

1838
02:02:54,360 --> 02:02:54,898
It is.

1839
02:02:54,984 --> 02:03:02,962
Okay? And he expresses his heroism quite clearly, all right? If you don't buy the products, if you spread the word, yes, we'll be shut down.

1840
02:03:03,036 --> 02:03:04,678
But it's not in Bankston's hands.

1841
02:03:04,764 --> 02:03:07,594
It's not in this SJW judge's hands.

1842
02:03:07,632 --> 02:03:09,154
It's not in Hillary Clinton's hands.

1843
02:03:09,252 --> 02:03:10,750
It's not in Satan's hands.

1844
02:03:10,860 --> 02:03:12,598
God helps those that helps themselves.

1845
02:03:12,744 --> 02:03:14,362
It is in your hands.

1846
02:03:14,436 --> 02:03:16,858
And I'll be quite honest with you.

1847
02:03:17,004 --> 02:03:18,720
I'm going to fight 100%.

1848
02:03:19,230 --> 02:03:24,586
I'm going to do the best job I can, but if you take me out of the game it was time for me to get off the field.

1849
02:03:24,648 --> 02:03:27,578
We've had nothing but devastating victory.

1850
02:03:27,734 --> 02:03:33,218
I'm not going to get the NFL quarterback ready to retire, but I can't because this isn't football, folks.

1851
02:03:33,254 --> 02:03:34,582
This is our children's future.

1852
02:03:34,716 --> 02:03:37,138
I'm telling you, I will never give up.

1853
02:03:37,224 --> 02:03:42,058
But if you don't back us and if you don't get how serious this is, you're next.

1854
02:03:42,204 --> 02:03:44,798
So I can't quit, and I will not quit.

1855
02:03:44,894 --> 02:03:49,546
But if you quit, I have no power.

1856
02:03:49,668 --> 02:03:52,250
This is such a weird abuse.

1857
02:03:52,370 --> 02:03:54,638
Listen, I will never quit.

1858
02:03:54,674 --> 02:03:56,150
But if you quit, I've already quit.

1859
02:03:56,210 --> 02:03:57,646
So that's the situation.

1860
02:03:57,768 --> 02:04:00,154
So I will never quit fighting for you.

1861
02:04:00,192 --> 02:04:03,014
I am a fucking hero for the children, and I will never quit.

1862
02:04:03,062 --> 02:04:06,194
And if the day does come that I do quit, it's your fault.

1863
02:04:06,362 --> 02:04:07,202
It's your fault.

1864
02:04:07,226 --> 02:04:08,102
It's your fault.

1865
02:04:08,246 --> 02:04:09,960
Listen, there's nothing I can do.

1866
02:04:10,290 --> 02:04:14,750
I would love to not quit, but I don't have hundreds of millions of dollars anymore.

1867
02:04:14,810 --> 02:04:16,358
Will never quit.

1868
02:04:16,394 --> 02:04:18,250
And if you stop paying me, I'm done.

1869
02:04:18,300 --> 02:04:19,106
And it's your fault.

1870
02:04:19,178 --> 02:04:21,434
Can you imagine? And then the kids will all die.

1871
02:04:21,482 --> 02:04:31,450
Can you imagine a sadder person than the one who is like, I will fight my holy crusade as long as I get a good salary.

1872
02:04:32,550 --> 02:04:34,970
Person is the person who buys into it and pays a salary.

1873
02:04:35,030 --> 02:04:35,566
That's fair.

1874
02:04:35,628 --> 02:04:36,490
Yeah, that is fair.

1875
02:04:36,540 --> 02:04:37,678
That is the sadder person.

1876
02:04:37,764 --> 02:04:39,350
Anyway, here's the dismount.

1877
02:04:39,410 --> 02:04:39,814
Okay.

1878
02:04:39,912 --> 02:04:41,266
God bless you all.

1879
02:04:41,388 --> 02:04:42,658
Thank you for tuning in.

1880
02:04:42,744 --> 02:04:51,958
Now share the live feed of this and share the archive of it at band video or roll over to die, which I know you're not going to do.

1881
02:04:51,984 --> 02:04:53,566
I'm sorry, what? I'm not going to do it either.

1882
02:04:53,628 --> 02:04:57,146
And I pledged to you all, I'm going to redouble my efforts.

1883
02:04:57,338 --> 02:04:58,560
That took a turn.

1884
02:04:59,910 --> 02:05:00,346
Yeah.

1885
02:05:00,408 --> 02:05:01,234
Got to have that.

1886
02:05:01,332 --> 02:05:01,846
But yeah.

1887
02:05:01,908 --> 02:05:04,690
Share this video or roll over and die.

1888
02:05:05,370 --> 02:05:12,120
Man, I can't imagine anyone wanting watching the video and being like, everyone must see this.

1889
02:05:13,110 --> 02:05:19,082
It's not really even a response to the news of the judgment.

1890
02:05:19,166 --> 02:05:22,080
No, it doesn't clear anything up.

1891
02:05:22,530 --> 02:05:27,158
It makes things as confusing as possible and then says, we'll get them in the Supreme Court.

1892
02:05:27,254 --> 02:05:29,662
You've said one shorter and half.

1893
02:05:29,736 --> 02:05:36,142
I know, but they've said over and over again, we're going to sue these people and we're going to win.

1894
02:05:36,216 --> 02:05:38,100
And they never sue anybody.

1895
02:05:38,670 --> 02:05:41,798
Why would you believe that? They're going to win in the Supreme Court.

1896
02:05:41,894 --> 02:05:43,990
They're going to do it one short a half.

1897
02:05:44,160 --> 02:05:47,206
I mean, Mike Lindell isn't even paying for the lawsuits this time.

1898
02:05:47,268 --> 02:05:48,214
They don't have it.

1899
02:05:48,312 --> 02:05:49,090
They don't got it.

1900
02:05:49,140 --> 02:06:00,826
Also, after that whole pageant that Alex did about really respecting Neil and Scarlett and me and wanting to support them and all this, it's great that he would want to drag this out even further and convenience them.

1901
02:06:00,888 --> 02:06:01,330
Absolutely.

1902
02:06:01,440 --> 02:06:02,602
So that's cool.

1903
02:06:02,796 --> 02:06:09,614
Anyway, we have reached what I will call the end of my patience for the trial coverage.

1904
02:06:09,662 --> 02:06:10,618
I think that's a good time.

1905
02:06:10,644 --> 02:06:18,360
This chapter has ended along with sneak week, and it's been something else.

1906
02:06:18,810 --> 02:06:29,446
I'm glad that it has closed the chapter, and I hope you have a good trip, but we have a lot to get to when you get back.

1907
02:06:29,568 --> 02:06:30,240
Right.

1908
02:06:31,590 --> 02:06:33,634
I'm looking on Twitter as we're recording this.

1909
02:06:33,672 --> 02:06:38,914
It turns out they leaked the warrant for Trump's search.

1910
02:06:39,012 --> 02:06:40,318
No, they released it.

1911
02:06:40,464 --> 02:06:42,614
I think it leaked and was released.

1912
02:06:42,782 --> 02:06:43,150
Yeah.

1913
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:44,350
Just have a fun time.

1914
02:06:44,460 --> 02:06:45,802
Have a fun day of it.

1915
02:06:45,876 --> 02:06:47,746
So there's a lot, man.

1916
02:06:47,808 --> 02:06:51,106
I mean, enjoy Ireland, but at the same time no, I understand.

1917
02:06:51,288 --> 02:06:54,110
Be conscious of the fact that chaos is brewing.

1918
02:06:54,170 --> 02:06:54,646
Sure.

1919
02:06:54,768 --> 02:06:56,570
Listen, give you brewing staff.

1920
02:06:56,630 --> 02:06:57,394
It will do.

1921
02:06:57,492 --> 02:06:59,710
You will get all kinds of druid shit, my man.

1922
02:06:59,760 --> 02:07:00,830
You are a druid.

1923
02:07:00,890 --> 02:07:01,500
Yes.

1924
02:07:03,570 --> 02:07:05,546
Get me a gandalf outfit.

1925
02:07:05,618 --> 02:07:07,138
Yeah, I got it.

1926
02:07:07,284 --> 02:07:08,950
I don't know if that's even Irish.

1927
02:07:10,830 --> 02:07:13,934
What's your character's name again? Dutch Wildfire.

1928
02:07:13,982 --> 02:07:15,098
That's right, Dutch Wildfire.

1929
02:07:15,134 --> 02:07:16,598
Anyway, I'm not going to keep that moniker.

1930
02:07:16,634 --> 02:07:25,498
It's been at the craziest few weeks, I think, either of our lives, and you have been an absolute fucking star.

1931
02:07:25,584 --> 02:07:26,158
Well, thank you.

1932
02:07:26,184 --> 02:07:26,746
You as well.

1933
02:07:26,808 --> 02:07:30,746
I am glad to take a little breaky.

1934
02:07:30,818 --> 02:07:31,750
Yeah, me too.

1935
02:07:31,860 --> 02:07:37,594
You can kind of tell, I think, in this episode, my exhaustion take a break.

1936
02:07:37,632 --> 02:07:40,958
I am glad to land this plane.

1937
02:07:41,054 --> 02:07:41,700
Absolutely.

1938
02:07:42,690 --> 02:07:43,054
Yeah.

1939
02:07:43,092 --> 02:07:43,666
We'll be back.

1940
02:07:43,728 --> 02:07:44,374
Indeed we will.

1941
02:07:44,412 --> 02:07:47,762
And we'll talk about Trump's rage response.

1942
02:07:47,786 --> 02:07:49,982
It's going to get crazy, but tell them, Jordan.

1943
02:07:50,006 --> 02:07:50,446
We have a website.

1944
02:07:50,508 --> 02:07:50,854
We do.

1945
02:07:50,892 --> 02:07:52,198
It's knowledgephite.com.

1946
02:07:52,284 --> 02:07:52,982
We're also on Twitter.

1947
02:07:53,006 --> 02:07:53,618
We are on Twitter.

1948
02:07:53,654 --> 02:07:55,010
That knowledge underscore fights.

1949
02:07:55,070 --> 02:07:56,458
We will be back.

1950
02:07:56,544 --> 02:07:58,286
But until then, Jordan.

1951
02:07:58,478 --> 02:07:59,282
I'm Neo.

1952
02:07:59,366 --> 02:07:59,990
I'm Leo.

1953
02:08:00,050 --> 02:08:01,358
I'm dzx Clark.

1954
02:08:01,454 --> 02:08:04,466
I'm Wilford Snippel snabble of the Gribble PIBBLE.

1955
02:08:04,598 --> 02:08:06,878
And now here comes the sex robots.

1956
02:08:06,974 --> 02:08:08,398
Andy and Jansis, you're on the air.

1957
02:08:08,424 --> 02:08:11,594
Thanks for holding, Alex.

1958
02:08:11,642 --> 02:08:12,542
I'm a first time caller.

1959
02:08:12,566 --> 02:08:13,334
I'm a huge fan.

1960
02:08:13,382 --> 02:08:14,170
I love your works.

1961
02:08:14,220 --> 02:08:14,500
I love you.
