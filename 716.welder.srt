00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,386
Hey, everybody, this is Dan.

2
00:00:02,458 --> 00:00:03,080
Hello.

3
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:15,838
I just wanted to drop in and give a little bit of a note before this episode begins, and the reason for that is because I kind of screwed up a little bit on the recording of this episode.

4
00:00:15,874 --> 00:00:29,194
And so some of the levels are a little bit iffy I've been using a technology that can't be named unless I be shading some business, but for remote recording.

5
00:00:29,242 --> 00:00:36,942
And it seemed like everything was totally fine as we were recording, and our guests actually very generously offered to record on their end.

6
00:00:37,016 --> 00:00:45,560
And because I had so much confidence in this tech, I thought, like, there's no need to this has worked just fine in the past.

7
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:55,200
And unfortunately, some of the audio is a little bit distorted, but it still sounds fine.

8
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,442
It could be a little cleaner.

9
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:07,480
Anyway, this is a rambling, long winded way for me to just give you a heads up about that and to take responsibility for the sound.

10
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,614
I messed up a little bit.

11
00:01:09,712 --> 00:01:19,660
Anyway, we'll be back on Wednesday with a normal episode with Jordan back, but for now, please enjoy this special app.

12
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,470
It's time to pray.

13
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,510
I have great respect for knowledge.

14
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,180
Fight.

15
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,220
knowledgefight.com.

16
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,210
I love you.

17
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,398
Hello, everybody.

18
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:23,220
Welcome back to a knowledge fight.

19
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,694
We are here.

20
00:02:24,792 --> 00:02:38,686
We've just had a week of a break, and if truth be told, I was under the impression that Jordan would be getting back over the weekend and that we could get back to work and do our job as normal, but this is not the case.

21
00:02:38,748 --> 00:02:40,634
Jordan will not be back until Tuesday.

22
00:02:40,742 --> 00:02:49,754
And so in order to get an episode out, I had to dig deep and find someone who capable of filling the shoes of Jordan.

23
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:57,194
And it turns out I found two people very excited to welcome to the podcast hosts of the Dollop, gareth Reynolds and David Anthony.

24
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,586
Welcome, gentlemen.

25
00:02:58,658 --> 00:03:00,730
Thank you, Jordan.

26
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:02,158
Yeah.

27
00:03:02,244 --> 00:03:02,950
Jordan's out.

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,390
This is a permanent thing.

29
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,782
I think we're going to go trios.

30
00:03:06,926 --> 00:03:07,606
I like it.

31
00:03:07,668 --> 00:03:16,958
Jordan, there's a great the way that we got it set up was pretty smooth and easy, so I feel like we're, like there's a synergy.

32
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,130
Yeah, definitely.

33
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:32,580
So, guys, I know that over the course of the time doing your podcast, you've touched on some of the, I don't know, maybe some things that are connected to my world, like the Jade Helm episode, for sure.

34
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,294
Clive and bundy, perhaps.

35
00:03:35,342 --> 00:03:35,940
Yeah.

36
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,500
Our god.

37
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:39,720
Yeah.

38
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,610
We've done two on the bundys or three.

39
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,494
Two on the bundys, right? Two.

40
00:03:44,532 --> 00:03:45,120
Yeah.

41
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:53,002
I was wondering, though, how much connections you have to Alex Jones himself via the show.

42
00:03:53,076 --> 00:03:55,718
Zero offline tons.

43
00:03:55,874 --> 00:03:56,580
Yeah.

44
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,050
We're very close to Alex.

45
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,890
Dave and Alex are really good.

46
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,370
A lot of people say that they get Dave and Alex confused.

47
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:15,210
I think that your personalities would mesh amazingly I would call it Vibe.

48
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:25,000
We vibe and we have a lot of the same sort of philosophies and just outlooks on life and protein powders, climate change.

49
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:29,200
That's one of the big things that's me.

50
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,986
No, we've not really gotten into Alex ever.

51
00:04:38,048 --> 00:04:40,170
If anything, it would be on the show.

52
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:40,554
Yeah.

53
00:04:40,592 --> 00:04:43,040
Maybe just minorly on the show.

54
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,794
I've always avoided him completely.

55
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:50,614
The only thing I really know about him is listening to your podcast.

56
00:04:50,782 --> 00:04:52,590
I'll pop in every once in a while to see what's going.

57
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,338
Alex Jones.

58
00:04:53,374 --> 00:04:57,222
But for the most part, I don't really pay attention to him.

59
00:04:57,296 --> 00:04:59,454
And it seems like he's had a quiet couple of weeks.

60
00:04:59,612 --> 00:05:01,700
Yeah, it's been real time.

61
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:14,970
He has, I think, abandoned Trump again, so that's a good sign for the investigation and the FBI raid.

62
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,638
I know someone who punched him and knocked him out.

63
00:05:19,784 --> 00:05:21,130
Alex charlie.

64
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:21,822
Yeah.

65
00:05:21,956 --> 00:05:25,450
20 some odd years ago in Texas.

66
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:30,250
Is this a space hitler? No, this is a guy named Charlie.

67
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,558
I'm just loving the conversation we're having from the sidelines right now.

68
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,494
It might also be space Hitler.

69
00:05:35,662 --> 00:05:37,830
Is it Space Hitler? No, Charlie.

70
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:41,350
No.

71
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:48,626
Charlie is a guy who is associated with the festival in Austin, south by Southwest.

72
00:05:48,758 --> 00:05:49,474
Oh, wow.

73
00:05:49,572 --> 00:05:53,220
He punched him, huh? He fucking knocked him down.

74
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:59,398
They were working at radio stations, I believe, and they got into it one night.

75
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:06,720
And Charlie Deckerman charlie, to this day, still gets free beers in Austin for having done that.

76
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,490
You get local hero status.

77
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,660
That's pretty awesome, I guess.

78
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:26,990
Look, I'm not thrilled with violence at any point, but if it's violence 20 years ago and it's funny, I would like to say that I am thrilled with violence.

79
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,690
I'm just happy to know there's a face Hitler.

80
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:41,200
Yeah, I think that might be the same guy because there was a dude who would, like, troll him on his public access show, and they ended up getting into a fight in a parking lot.

81
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:50,310
I think that Space Hitler was there, and that was the same night.

82
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,802
And two guys hitler was also involved.

83
00:06:54,946 --> 00:06:56,334
A different guy, though.

84
00:06:56,492 --> 00:07:01,820
How much that sounds like it would be something on Infowars, what just was said.

85
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,670
I think Space Hitler was there, but there were two guys in the parking lots.

86
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:28,990
So you guys didn't even like even before, like present days, you didn't have any kind of impression of Alex Jones as a figure? Oh, yeah, he was somebody who existed.

87
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,734
No, we've just never talked about him on the show, really.

88
00:07:32,772 --> 00:07:45,818
But yeah, obviously it's hard to even remember when you first heard about him, but yeah, obviously been following his lunacy for the better part of a decade.

89
00:07:45,854 --> 00:07:46,990
Really? Yeah.

90
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,146
But I purposely got him away not to watch anything.

91
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:53,782
I just don't watch anything with him, like, when I see clips of them online.

92
00:07:53,916 --> 00:08:01,178
But I've heard about him for a long time now, and I've definitely read a couple of articles about him and then your podcast.

93
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:05,400
I listened to both the documentary episodes, which were long but crazy.

94
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,540
Yeah.

95
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,790
That got me sub tweeted by the director.

96
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:19,120
Oh, really? It's her, right? Yeah, she did a terrible job.

97
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:24,942
So, look, there's a lot going on with Alex in the present day.

98
00:08:25,016 --> 00:08:27,020
Like you mentioned, slow week.

99
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,020
He's going through a lot of things.

100
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,062
He's having some tantrums.

101
00:08:32,206 --> 00:08:38,586
But I felt like getting into all that might be too much, might be throwing you guys into the deep end.

102
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,878
And I didn't want to put you through that.

103
00:08:40,964 --> 00:08:42,154
That's sweet.

104
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:45,726
What I wanted to do is I wanted to do something a little bit special for you.

105
00:08:45,788 --> 00:08:56,230
And a lot of times listeners will get in touch with us and ask us to do an episode about their birthday, like what happened on my birthday on infowars.

106
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:07,160
What I figured I would do is I would take us back to April 25, 2014, the day you guys put out your first episode of The Dollar wow.

107
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,640
And see what Alex Jones was doing.

108
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,440
This is around I mean, Jade Helm was starting to kick up.

109
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:20,360
I think that heat was a little bit more in the 15, though, right? Wasn't it? Okay.

110
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,638
Our first episode is the bundys.

111
00:09:23,674 --> 00:09:25,410
So it was right in the bundy rage.

112
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,366
Bundys will come up.

113
00:09:27,548 --> 00:09:29,850
Yeah, he was into that.

114
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:30,714
Yeah.

115
00:09:30,872 --> 00:09:34,150
There's a lot of news going on at that point in 2014.

116
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:41,382
There's plenty going on, and I think we'll be disappointed to learn about what most of this episode ends up being about.

117
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:45,562
But let us dive in here at the beginning.

118
00:09:45,646 --> 00:09:48,210
This is how Alex is starting off the show.

119
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,666
Ukrainian helicopter hit by grenade taking off.

120
00:09:51,728 --> 00:09:56,038
Ukraine helicopter has been crippled in the Grenada tacking Orange mosque.

121
00:09:56,074 --> 00:09:58,640
I was in sneering a third world war.

122
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:03,282
That's one to graph headline more.

123
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:07,098
That is the crane minister that's saying that, by the way.

124
00:10:07,124 --> 00:10:15,114
And also their vice presidente, ukraine foreign minister ready to fight Russia is the headline from the Associated Press.

125
00:10:15,272 --> 00:10:21,018
So, yeah, we go back into the past and we see something pretty reminiscent of recent news.

126
00:10:21,104 --> 00:10:21,740
Wow.

127
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:22,806
Yeah.

128
00:10:22,928 --> 00:10:24,450
That's so rational.

129
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,102
He does that's.

130
00:10:28,126 --> 00:10:33,990
One of the problems with him is that sometimes he sounds like that, and then other times he's screaming about you.

131
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:34,782
Wait.

132
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:35,922
Well, here's the problem.

133
00:10:35,996 --> 00:10:38,250
That's just him reading headlines.

134
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,706
Interpretation.

135
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:46,698
It's pretty easy to sound fairly rational when you're just like, cold reading, here is a thing that happened.

136
00:10:46,844 --> 00:10:47,540
Yeah.

137
00:10:47,870 --> 00:11:05,254
But then you get into the analysis of it, and it might be a little bit sillier here, and that is him blaming essentially the west is what caused the 2014 outbreak of hostilities between Ukraine and Russia.

138
00:11:05,422 --> 00:11:23,794
The west went in three months ago when Ukraine voted to not join with the EU and to be driven by that spider and instead tried to say somewhat neutral, I don't want you crane by the Russian spider or the globalist spider.

139
00:11:23,842 --> 00:11:32,180
But the global spider is about ten times bigger, fatter, older, more evil and more anti human.

140
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:44,578
I mean, the Russian is just happy to be in power and control of its own population, is trying to breed a larger Roost key population because it realizes that its own system is collapsing.

141
00:11:44,734 --> 00:11:53,254
The global spider is a transhumanist power tripping spider that believes it's God and is attacking anything decent.

142
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:56,180
I see you're trying to make sense of this day.

143
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,290
You're tracking the thought.

144
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:08,850
I'm trying to track the thought and it's very hard to track, but I will say I do like the idea of calling the EU a spider.

145
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:12,270
It's got a web, it's going to suck the drive.

146
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,794
I like the sucking dry spider.

147
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:16,938
It's almost like you know how it is.

148
00:12:16,964 --> 00:12:21,946
Like when you do a podcast, you'll say some stuff and you'll be like, that didn't make sense, and you kind of let it die.

149
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:35,034
But he's quadrupling down on the spider talk to the point where because he's so insane towards the end, you're like, I think he might actually think this is spiders that are doing this.

150
00:12:35,132 --> 00:12:39,810
Yeah, he just watched Wild Wild West the night before he was offset.

151
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,170
Kevin Klein is behind the spiders.

152
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:47,190
Kevin Klein was just elected to the UN council.

153
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:56,110
So, yeah, you have this world view and this presentation that is fairly consistent throughout time.

154
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:02,102
That is, anything that involves Russia ends up being everybody else's fault.

155
00:13:02,186 --> 00:13:02,434
Right.

156
00:13:02,472 --> 00:13:14,846
And that's not to say that he is like, obviously he's not on the Russian payroll or anything like that, but he is deeply into making excuses for everything that involves Russia.

157
00:13:14,978 --> 00:13:18,240
He's also saying Russia is collapsing at the same time.

158
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,814
True, but it's in a sympathetic way.

159
00:13:21,852 --> 00:13:25,666
I think they're the big victim, sort of.

160
00:13:25,788 --> 00:13:27,350
Yeah, the victim spider.

161
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,930
Yeah, they're the victim spider.

162
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,622
Come on.

163
00:13:30,636 --> 00:13:32,266
It's a classic victim spider situation.

164
00:13:32,388 --> 00:13:33,142
Come on.

165
00:13:33,276 --> 00:13:36,010
You know what I mean? You got to help the victim spider.

166
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:37,800
Yeah.

167
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:51,134
So with the taking of Crimea and that kind of actions that were happening, they're collapsing is kind of an excuse for why they would take these oil rich areas and these resources.

168
00:13:51,182 --> 00:13:52,238
It's like they're collapsing.

169
00:13:52,274 --> 00:13:52,858
They need to do this.

170
00:13:52,884 --> 00:13:54,422
They need to breed more Russians.

171
00:13:54,506 --> 00:13:54,934
Yeah.

172
00:13:55,032 --> 00:13:56,230
Russian fighters.

173
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:58,310
Literally.

174
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,030
No one's ever said that they need to breathe or rush.

175
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,330
They're doing that at my Humane Society.

176
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:36,214
So you guys may not be the best, like, prognosticators on this front, but do you think that Alex thinks the outbreak between Ukraine and Russia is real? This 2014 fight or the one today, the god, something being shot down, right? If anything shot down out of the sky, then Alex, it's not real.

177
00:14:36,252 --> 00:14:38,534
It can't be false fly spider.

178
00:14:38,642 --> 00:14:41,602
It's too similar to blackhawk down.

179
00:14:41,676 --> 00:14:42,566
It's all fake.

180
00:14:42,698 --> 00:14:43,858
Yes, that's right.

181
00:14:44,004 --> 00:14:44,854
Well, here we go.

182
00:14:44,892 --> 00:14:45,598
Let's see.

183
00:14:45,744 --> 00:14:50,170
But we've always known that a large global war is what's supposed to bring in the final world government.

184
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,960
That's what the globalists have said themselves.

185
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,490
And now it looks like they're trying to do it.

186
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,094
They may have some backroom deal with Putin, and this may be staged.

187
00:14:58,142 --> 00:14:59,734
My gut tells me it's not.

188
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,020
Well, there we are.

189
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:13,058
The background being between Ukraine and Russia, or between the spider, the EU, which spiders, though? There's three spiders involved.

190
00:15:13,154 --> 00:15:14,906
I don't think you cranes a spider.

191
00:15:15,098 --> 00:15:16,406
Buckeyes not a spider.

192
00:15:16,538 --> 00:15:17,726
Ukraine is a fly.

193
00:15:17,858 --> 00:15:18,986
Yeah, Ukraine's a fly.

194
00:15:19,058 --> 00:15:19,402
Right.

195
00:15:19,476 --> 00:15:20,182
Okay.

196
00:15:20,376 --> 00:15:24,000
So he's saying Russia and the EU are working together.

197
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:35,798
Yeah, he's saying the possibilities are that it's a real violent outbreak, or there's a backroom deal between the EU and Putin to split Ukraine in half.

198
00:15:35,944 --> 00:15:44,870
It's just great, because the way that he's able to bring that up and be like, my goodness, that's not what's going on.

199
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,650
It's like, Dude, you're not rational.

200
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,098
Look, that might be what's going on.

201
00:15:51,124 --> 00:15:52,960
I'm open to that possibility, obviously.

202
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:53,918
Yeah.

203
00:15:54,004 --> 00:15:59,406
It would be like someone being like, yeah, there's a lot of signs that alien invasion is right around the corner.

204
00:15:59,478 --> 00:16:00,698
My gut says it's not.

205
00:16:00,784 --> 00:16:01,658
My gut says it's not.

206
00:16:01,684 --> 00:16:03,122
But obviously it's very possible.

207
00:16:03,256 --> 00:16:04,540
It's highly possible.

208
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:10,358
It seems like you only are talking about that distinct possibility that you don't think is correct.

209
00:16:10,444 --> 00:16:11,930
You know what? That's going to be great.

210
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:24,194
What's going to be great one day is when he's just doing his show, and he's going to collapse on the infowars desk, and his belly is just going to open up, and you're going to find out that he was just a master egg for spiders, and they're all going to crawl out of it.

211
00:16:24,352 --> 00:16:25,106
Yeah.

212
00:16:25,288 --> 00:16:26,994
It was never a metaphor.

213
00:16:27,102 --> 00:16:27,760
Yeah.

214
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:34,100
All time, he was living like Vincent Dinafrio and Men in Black his whole life.

215
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:47,300
So you might think, based on what we've heard so far, that this was going to be an episode that was largely about Russia and Ukraine, and you could be forgiven for thinking that it is not.

216
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,100
Things take a turn.

217
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:59,158
Alex is discussing how one of his reporters, David Knight, he has been taking some time off, and because of that, he's ended up listening to some talk radio.

218
00:16:59,314 --> 00:17:11,240
And this is some real chaos, but he's been off the last few days moving, and I guess out of one apartment into a house while he's still trying to buy a house.

219
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,014
And so he's been listening to talk radio.

220
00:17:14,182 --> 00:17:16,662
He was listening to our local affiliate at 590 a.

221
00:17:16,676 --> 00:17:16,890
M.

222
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:27,298
Last night because his brother in law out of North Carolina, Caldon, and said, you better go listen to Glenn Beck.

223
00:17:27,334 --> 00:17:36,642
Will it rehears here locally? And so he turned in last night while packing the Hue Hall, and he said, we got to go into Glenbeck's archive and find it.

224
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,598
But he said, this is really bad.

225
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,098
We have to do something about this.

226
00:17:40,244 --> 00:17:43,218
And I said, what did he say? He said, Well, I'll just come in and tell you.

227
00:17:43,304 --> 00:17:49,398
But he told me over the phone right before broadcast, he's driving up here right now to be on the next segment or at the bottom of the hour.

228
00:17:49,544 --> 00:17:51,270
This is an emergency.

229
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,850
Glenn Beck is talking some shit.

230
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,806
Here we go.

231
00:17:55,988 --> 00:18:03,630
So he's calling in the guy who's taking time off to move into a house because he's buying a different house.

232
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:11,398
He's having that guy come to the studio on his days off because Glen Beck said some shit.

233
00:18:11,554 --> 00:18:12,260
Yes.

234
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,534
A lot of people are thinking there's not even a second house.

235
00:18:16,572 --> 00:18:19,980
A lot of people are thinking that the second house is just kind of a false house.

236
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,370
It's actually a spider's nest.

237
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,070
It's a spider's nest, exactly.

238
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,062
I mean, the amount of detail, you could just be like, coming up next, we're going to talk about Glenn back.

239
00:18:29,136 --> 00:18:31,210
But instead he's like so he's moving from one house.

240
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,550
He's listening to 590, but he's also leaving his apartment.

241
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,494
He's got these loading up the U Haul.

242
00:18:36,602 --> 00:18:37,258
He's on the way.

243
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:37,860
Yeah.

244
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:48,862
That's part of his magic, is that he throws in details about stuff that doesn't need details, and it makes him sound like he knows more than he really does.

245
00:18:48,936 --> 00:18:49,390
Yes.

246
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:56,734
But in this case, it actually convinces me a little bit that he's telling the truth about this guy moving and being inconvenient for sure.

247
00:18:56,772 --> 00:18:57,720
Seems real.

248
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:58,800
Yeah.

249
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,538
The accidental truth.

250
00:19:01,634 --> 00:19:03,790
I'm starting to think this guy might be moving.

251
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,050
That's all I'm buying.

252
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,254
And it sounds like Alex is a shitty boss.

253
00:19:09,362 --> 00:19:11,230
Yeah, totally.

254
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:15,106
To be like I mean, I'm not sure what's going he's taken three days to move.

255
00:19:15,168 --> 00:19:16,958
It's just kind of fucking ridiculous.

256
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,678
And also, the guy apparently doesn't listen.

257
00:19:19,764 --> 00:19:22,702
The only excuse he has to listen to radio is that he's moving.

258
00:19:22,776 --> 00:19:27,370
Other than that, you want to motivate yourself when you're moving.

259
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:31,226
See, throw on a little Am talk radio to just kind of get the gears in motion.

260
00:19:31,358 --> 00:19:34,918
This story actually shifts a little bit as the episode goes on.

261
00:19:35,004 --> 00:19:43,320
Later we find out that David Knight's brother lives in another city and he saw Glen back and told David Knight to listen to it.

262
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,838
There are some wrinkles here.

263
00:19:45,864 --> 00:20:01,510
We're not entirely sure what's true, but yeah, I think one thing that sucks is that he's coming in because of Glenn Beck talking shit, not because Russia and Ukraine are ramping up hostilities.

264
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:06,994
This is the kind of news organization that's like Glenn Beck, you've got to come in.

265
00:20:07,092 --> 00:20:16,300
Yeah, World War II might be happening, but Glenn Beck has a 590 a m show.

266
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,614
We got to get into this.

267
00:20:18,772 --> 00:20:26,020
But see, the problem is basically that Glenn Beck is just jealous of Alex, which I think we all could see coming.

268
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:27,520
Yeah.

269
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:33,338
He went offline he went off air and went online and moved his operation there.

270
00:20:33,364 --> 00:20:37,014
And he's never going to be as successful as Alexander.

271
00:20:37,182 --> 00:20:38,258
Well, that's true.

272
00:20:38,344 --> 00:20:48,794
But The Blaze has so many cool people working there so many greats I guess Steven Crowder is there, right? God, is that what Crowder is.

273
00:20:48,952 --> 00:20:53,030
I think he might say it's fucking two failed comedians.

274
00:20:53,410 --> 00:21:00,230
Well, I mean, that's most of the right wing, right? But let's be honest, crowder is pretty funny.

275
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:04,962
Anyway.

276
00:21:05,036 --> 00:21:07,818
Alex believes that Glenn Beck is jealous of him.

277
00:21:07,964 --> 00:21:11,994
Know what this is? He knows we're getting on affiliates all over the country.

278
00:21:12,032 --> 00:21:13,578
The show is exploding right now.

279
00:21:13,724 --> 00:21:16,150
Most of the stations were on carry Glenn Beck.

280
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:24,570
And he knows, because I've talked to some program directors that there's little comments and things going on from the people in his office.

281
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:31,326
Not even a syndicator premiere about me and how I'm a bad show to have.

282
00:21:31,508 --> 00:21:33,930
And this has been going on behind the scenes.

283
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:38,190
And then a lot of times, I'm on live and Glenn Beck's on at night.

284
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,246
He doesn't like that.

285
00:21:39,308 --> 00:21:40,606
He's an egomaniac.

286
00:21:40,678 --> 00:21:41,346
Yeah.

287
00:21:41,528 --> 00:21:44,120
My show end up getting picked up on Sunday live.

288
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:50,360
While we do that show, people get a taste of it, then they put us on at night, and then invariably, we end up going on live.

289
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:56,250
They literally replace Rush Limbaugh with us in the areas of the country and get better ratings.

290
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,942
I never had this slot to go up against Rush Limbaugh.

291
00:21:58,966 --> 00:22:00,094
I didn't want this slot.

292
00:22:00,202 --> 00:22:00,834
Wow.

293
00:22:00,992 --> 00:22:02,758
He's beating Rush Limbaugh.

294
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:03,222
Wow.

295
00:22:03,296 --> 00:22:03,920
Yeah.

296
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:18,098
Maybe mildly delusional, but cool as someone's handing him, like, notes, letting them know, like, Putin is thinking of dropping a nuke.

297
00:22:18,134 --> 00:22:18,838
Hold on a second.

298
00:22:18,924 --> 00:22:22,860
So Rush is actually also intimidated by us over here.

299
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:34,610
We have a strategy where, like, a drug dealer and I put my show on your Sunday night so you get a taste for people who are moving.

300
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,120
If you want to move and listen to a show, put us on.

301
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,358
We are info dealers.

302
00:22:41,514 --> 00:22:42,220
Yeah.

303
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:43,322
I love that.

304
00:22:43,336 --> 00:22:45,530
He's bragging about a Sunday night slot.

305
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:47,990
Baseball.

306
00:22:49,390 --> 00:23:10,298
If you're watching, you're just like, all right, are we fighting infowars, or is this like a clip? When do we go back to fighting infowars? I think that this is something that's kind of maybe under known publicly is how much of his show ends up being kind of like this, where I had no idea.

307
00:23:10,444 --> 00:23:29,800
Why does anyone list? Who cares? Well, that was one of the things about the trial that was so exceptional was to actually have someone there be like, what are you talking about? So often to be able to do that, like, to pull that move because we just need yes or no.

308
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:30,880
Yeah.

309
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:35,630
In his depositions, the best moments are the like, Mr.

310
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:42,914
Jones, do you know what question you're answering? Almost invariably, the answer is no.

311
00:23:42,952 --> 00:23:45,700
He has no idea where the sentence started.

312
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:55,974
So this goes back to when Space Nazi and Charlie here we go.

313
00:23:56,132 --> 00:24:01,580
That night, they were in a radio show, and he was a failed radio guy.

314
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:04,938
The radio guy still gas at him.

315
00:24:04,964 --> 00:24:07,626
It's still a deep seated thing.

316
00:24:07,688 --> 00:24:10,050
He wants to be king of fucking radio.

317
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,090
That's what he's talking about.

318
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,574
Like, he's bragging he's better than Radio Spider.

319
00:24:15,742 --> 00:24:17,154
It just doesn't matter.

320
00:24:17,252 --> 00:24:18,850
It just doesn't matter anymore.

321
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:22,246
Yeah, there's a bit of projection, possibly.

322
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,920
I think I'm picking up on some of that, too.

323
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,342
Yeah, he has a chip on his shoulder.

324
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:33,930
That's something that is also sort of ubiquitous throughout his career.

325
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:36,186
I'm the best.

326
00:24:36,248 --> 00:24:47,098
But also everyone is jealous of me and that's why look, they're trying to kick me off these stations because Glenn Beck is jealous of me and he's talking shit.

327
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:53,754
That kind of vibe is, yeah, funny guys have always talk shit about each other.

328
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:55,098
They can't not do it.

329
00:24:55,184 --> 00:24:56,720
No, that is very true.

330
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,480
It's such a community.

331
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:03,474
It's such a forgotten community or something.

332
00:25:03,512 --> 00:25:08,550
That was like they were the rock stars in the yeah.

333
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,510
Wolfman.

334
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:13,914
Now.

335
00:25:13,952 --> 00:25:17,120
Alex Jones brought low.

336
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:26,478
So Alex is going to bring up some of the accusations that Glenn Beck has made about him here on this next question.

337
00:25:26,504 --> 00:25:30,642
It's important to double down on the important news of the day.

338
00:25:30,836 --> 00:25:33,474
I mean, this is definitely the top story.

339
00:25:33,572 --> 00:25:45,030
Obviously, I'm going to talk to Mike briefly about what he heard Beck say last night, and I guess we're going to dig through the video and audio files of it yesterday and posted just to document what we're saying.

340
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,050
But it doesn't matter.

341
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:59,374
A lot of you probably heard it saying that we want violence and we're basically covering up the races in a bundy and that we were out there at the ranch two weeks ago when he said all this, when we all now know this was taped Saturday and would not buy our reporters.

342
00:25:59,482 --> 00:26:01,062
And of course we reported on it.

343
00:26:01,136 --> 00:26:04,990
I mean, it's one thing to say Monday could be a hillbilly or maybe racist.

344
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,174
I don't think that's the case.

345
00:26:06,212 --> 00:26:11,550
He's certainly a fossil, though, and I think some of the stuff you say could be taken as offensive.

346
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,198
I'll bring one in the house.

347
00:26:16,284 --> 00:26:17,580
Got them around here.

348
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,198
It's just literally out in the middle of nowhere.

349
00:26:20,234 --> 00:26:22,258
It'd be like I brought a Yankee in here.

350
00:26:22,404 --> 00:26:24,938
I saw them city slicker.

351
00:26:25,034 --> 00:26:26,294
These are folks in the desert.

352
00:26:26,342 --> 00:26:27,430
Seven generations.

353
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:32,306
Yeah, he might just be a fossil, but he's not racist.

354
00:26:32,438 --> 00:26:34,140
He's a fossil, but he's not wrong.

355
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:38,618
It's really odd to listen to Alex Jones.

356
00:26:38,714 --> 00:26:48,840
Alex Jones, like, for him to be talking about himself and his little orbit in the way that he does about everything else.

357
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,850
Nothing if not, like, self obsessed.

358
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,540
That does happen a lot.

359
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:05,310
But the way that you're like talking about posting audio files, honestly, nobody cares.

360
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:15,440
What's actually important? Well, what's actually important is that Glenn Beck has said that Alex wants to overthrow the government, which he kind of does.

361
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:21,140
He pretty clearly has been super against the federal government for 20 years.

362
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:37,890
And then he's covering up racism by not calling what Kaisen Bundy said racist, which I don't know if you remember, but it was basically him saying that, hey, maybe black people were better off under slavery, and then he would have one in his house.

363
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:43,950
He's not opposed to having a black person in his house, which is, in the Bundy family, considered progressive.

364
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:50,120
Basically, though, everything that Glenn Beck appears to be saying about Alex seems fair.

365
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:55,938
He's doing that thing where you're going, god damn it.

366
00:27:55,964 --> 00:27:56,118
Now.

367
00:27:56,144 --> 00:27:56,986
I agree with Glenn.

368
00:27:56,998 --> 00:27:58,410
Becky asshole.

369
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:04,814
Yeah, that is the battle.

370
00:28:04,922 --> 00:28:07,080
Sometimes it's like, oh, no.

371
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:10,918
You have made a good point about Alex Jones low bar, though.

372
00:28:10,944 --> 00:28:12,590
That's pretty unimpressive.

373
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,260
Yes.

374
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:19,958
Cliven Bundy, that was your guy's first episode, right? That was our first episode.

375
00:28:19,994 --> 00:28:22,910
That was before Dave thought he was going to have me on the show permanently.

376
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,538
We were just going to his garage to talk about the Bundy's.

377
00:28:25,634 --> 00:28:27,662
It was magic in a bottle.

378
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:35,170
And the same day you put out that episode, this was happening on Alex's show, talking about Clive and Bundle Readable and how he is.

379
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:40,440
He's just old fashioned, man that's got to understand.

380
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:47,980
Say the N word is in the middle of nowhere that do talk like this.

381
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:50,390
And they're actually not racist.

382
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,318
They are literally out of a time machine.

383
00:28:54,474 --> 00:28:54,938
Right.

384
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:57,162
But there's bad things if you go back in a time machine.

385
00:28:57,186 --> 00:28:58,226
There's also good things.

386
00:28:58,348 --> 00:29:07,086
They're saying no to the Feds and notice Square because they're so old fashioned, that's the good part of their old fashionedness is to be straight shooting and to stand up against tyranny.

387
00:29:07,158 --> 00:29:12,242
But then it's like talking to somebody who got off a time machine from 150 years ago.

388
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:17,680
It sounds really weird to modern trendies and Metrosexuals and everybody else.

389
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:23,906
So the one thing I will say he's correct on is the bunny's war against Tiananmen Square.

390
00:29:24,088 --> 00:29:24,614
Yes.

391
00:29:24,712 --> 00:29:34,780
It's just the more that that goes on, the more it's like, Jesus Christ, is he mad living? More or less.

392
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:37,420
He loses the thread quite a bit.

393
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:43,074
He's like a guy who starts running downhill and he can't stop.

394
00:29:43,232 --> 00:29:48,046
Yeah, let's start a GoFundMe to get him running down the hill.

395
00:29:48,118 --> 00:29:50,130
I would love to see that footage.

396
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:57,754
I love reality shows because you get to watch the word literally be taken out back and abused.

397
00:29:57,922 --> 00:30:02,610
And his quote in there is, they are literally from a time machine.

398
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,000
True.

399
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:17,302
I think one of the problems with the entire roll downhill and the momentum of it was that there was something true to it.

400
00:30:17,436 --> 00:30:21,420
They are essentially from a time machine, but they're coming from a racist time.

401
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:30,346
So you're making an excuse for this by being like, no, their minds are back from slavery time.

402
00:30:30,468 --> 00:30:30,934
Yes.

403
00:30:31,032 --> 00:30:32,302
And we're like, yeah, exactly.

404
00:30:32,376 --> 00:30:32,950
That's a problem.

405
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,050
And he's like, yeah, well, they're time travelers.

406
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:39,166
Okay? Yeah, well, in our time, we're not cool with that.

407
00:30:39,288 --> 00:30:43,810
If they are time travelers, then we need to teach them about the modern world.

408
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,938
No, then the whole space time continuum.

409
00:30:45,974 --> 00:30:47,710
Then you're jumping in the middle of the ripple effect.

410
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,910
You don't understand what you're doing to the universe.

411
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:51,166
Oh, no.

412
00:30:51,348 --> 00:30:56,170
When you open up the world of spiders, time spiders.

413
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:04,660
So we have a little bit more Russia and Ukraine news that comes up.

414
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:07,420
A lot of people think Glenn Beck's behind it.

415
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:12,100
There are murmurs of this and the Council on Foreign Relations.

416
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:13,480
Sure.

417
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:21,614
And so we get to the possibility of nuclear war coming up, but only after incessant amount of time.

418
00:31:21,712 --> 00:31:30,422
Talking about Glenn Beck and if I was a coward or even if I had more self preservation instincts, I would be getting my family out of the United States right now.

419
00:31:30,616 --> 00:31:55,950
And I'm not saying that means we're going to have a nuclear war, but if there was, say, a 10% chance that there was going to be a nuclear war, would you get your family out of major target sites like the middle of Texas or robbers were coming to kill you? Would you get out of your house that night? Probably higher that we're going to have a full out nuclear war.

420
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,706
And people heard my show for 19 years.

421
00:31:59,768 --> 00:32:04,410
Some of you have been listing that long in Austin, been syndicated for almost 18.

422
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,942
You know, I've never talked like that.

423
00:32:07,016 --> 00:32:08,720
He always talks like that.

424
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,130
It's very regular.

425
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:15,294
But he also does frequently say, you know, I don't talk like this.

426
00:32:15,332 --> 00:32:18,378
So if you didn't listen to a bunch of his show, you wouldn't know that.

427
00:32:18,464 --> 00:32:18,786
Right.

428
00:32:18,848 --> 00:32:22,770
Dave, you seem to have maybe a bone to pick with Texas.

429
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:29,842
Just made me laugh that he put like the main target central Texas.

430
00:32:29,926 --> 00:32:31,138
Central Texas.

431
00:32:31,294 --> 00:32:31,782
All right.

432
00:32:31,856 --> 00:32:32,780
Yeah, sure.

433
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:33,594
Yeah.

434
00:32:33,632 --> 00:32:35,254
The great threat of Central Texas.

435
00:32:35,302 --> 00:32:43,290
Yeah, we'll hit them right where the economy's hard pulses from the middle of Texas.

436
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:52,690
We've long known that the Kremlin wants to take out bevo the University of Eradicate water Burger.

437
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:55,160
Then they will be partying our hands.

438
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,466
You see the red dawn.

439
00:32:57,538 --> 00:33:00,438
We have to take out the football capitals first.

440
00:33:00,584 --> 00:33:01,410
That's right.

441
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,300
Texas a name is where these hydra heads from.

442
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:18,542
David Knight, the guy who was yes, the guy who was moving, he shows up and he wants to come in and talk about how Glen Beck has been talking this shit.

443
00:33:18,626 --> 00:33:24,098
And this leads Alex to make quite a bold pronouncement about Glenn Beck.

444
00:33:24,194 --> 00:33:25,918
What he was saying was he said, they're pushing for this.

445
00:33:25,944 --> 00:33:32,374
He goes, when I heard that it was I knew from the beginning that I didn't want I want to be on the other side of the story because Infowars made this a national story.

446
00:33:32,412 --> 00:33:35,450
He goes, that should be a red flag, not a false flag.

447
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,310
Hahaha.

448
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,410
Not blaming fraud, giving me credit.

449
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,514
Rogers made it a national story.

450
00:33:39,552 --> 00:33:40,042
We broke it.

451
00:33:40,056 --> 00:33:41,974
He made a national it is a big story.

452
00:33:42,072 --> 00:33:44,378
And he's saying that we're constantly pushing for revolution.

453
00:33:44,414 --> 00:33:46,246
I think that's not true.

454
00:33:46,308 --> 00:33:55,726
What happened there is exactly what Glenn Beck claims he wants to see happen, and that is peaceful people peacefully standing up with loaded guns in their face.

455
00:33:55,788 --> 00:33:56,962
Like Tinyman square.

456
00:33:57,096 --> 00:34:01,546
Now, some people I didn't see anybody down there with a gun on them.

457
00:34:01,728 --> 00:34:06,286
Well, actually, there was a couple of guys that were holding rifles, but nobody was waiting back up there.

458
00:34:06,348 --> 00:34:07,598
There was one guy on the bridge.

459
00:34:07,634 --> 00:34:09,770
They keep showing that picture from multiple angles.

460
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:13,462
Okay, now it's been projected onto us.

461
00:34:13,536 --> 00:34:18,758
And now we weren't there this weekend when he made the black comments.

462
00:34:18,914 --> 00:34:21,850
And then you said he said mostly we were involved in that.

463
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,038
These guys are embedded there.

464
00:34:23,064 --> 00:34:24,058
They're everywhere he goes.

465
00:34:24,144 --> 00:34:26,462
They know that he was making those comments last Saturday.

466
00:34:26,546 --> 00:34:28,990
Well, that was not even the same Saturday.

467
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,090
He's totally out of this.

468
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,100
He's not wrong.

469
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:34,126
I know his insider people.

470
00:34:34,188 --> 00:34:36,682
He's had at least four FBI just with him at all times.

471
00:34:36,876 --> 00:34:37,958
So called retired.

472
00:34:38,054 --> 00:34:39,310
This is FBI.

473
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,622
Just like Al Sharpton's.

474
00:34:40,646 --> 00:34:41,198
FBI.

475
00:34:41,294 --> 00:34:45,374
I will bet my right arm the FBI is feeding all this to Glen Beck.

476
00:34:45,482 --> 00:34:47,006
Glenbeck is the FBI.

477
00:34:47,078 --> 00:34:48,350
Oh, Glenbeck.

478
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,642
Oh, my God.

479
00:34:49,716 --> 00:34:50,998
It's, like, beautiful.

480
00:34:51,144 --> 00:34:53,410
It's like jazz nonsense.

481
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:01,660
There's so much phenomenal stuff in there.

482
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:23,510
But it's also amazing that okay, you have the audio of Glenn Beck saying this, but in order to preserve the illusion of news, you're bringing in the guy who just listened to the Am radio for his first person account of listening to the Am radio station.

483
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:29,900
Playing the clip wouldn't be as fun.

484
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:40,520
And then to have the balls to be like, and what should we lay underneath that? Let's do a little Joe Cocker help from my friends.

485
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,846
Yeah, the evidence is pretty strong.

486
00:35:54,028 --> 00:36:00,734
Now, more important question, do you think that Alex knew he was going to make that accusation when the sentence started? No.

487
00:36:00,832 --> 00:36:02,140
Honestly, no.

488
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:12,954
Again, we're outsiders, but it is just the different connection points.

489
00:36:13,112 --> 00:36:22,750
And as he starts to advance and run down the hill, remember Plinko on The Price is Right where it just sort of drops and lands.

490
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:23,910
It's sort of like that.

491
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,534
His mind is plinkoing.

492
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:28,606
He's bouncing around, and then spider.

493
00:36:28,678 --> 00:36:32,410
FBI, and then it drops flag, and then it drops in the FBI.

494
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,350
And so Glen Beck is the FBI.

495
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:42,226
Yeah, but he's going to stick with this for now, but I should say in the present day, glenn Beck likes Alex.

496
00:36:42,358 --> 00:36:44,480
So Alex likes Glenn Beck? Now.

497
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:51,550
He must have been wrong about the FBI thing, because he still has his right arm.

498
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:53,880
Well, yeah.

499
00:36:55,710 --> 00:37:00,610
One of the great things about Alex is that every episode is a bottle episode.

500
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:02,400
Nothing really.

501
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:07,320
You don't have to hold yourself to any of these predictions like nuclear war.

502
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:12,050
It all just washes away tomorrow.

503
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:14,020
It's awesome.

504
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,520
Groundhog Day conspiracy, man.

505
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:20,886
No continuity.

506
00:37:21,018 --> 00:37:21,458
Right.

507
00:37:21,544 --> 00:37:26,774
I wonder how many times he's predicted, like, something like nuclear war.

508
00:37:26,932 --> 00:37:29,910
If you could go back and count, it would be incredible.

509
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:35,186
Over 20 years on our show, I would say at least 50 times.

510
00:37:35,248 --> 00:37:37,262
I've heard it so good.

511
00:37:37,396 --> 00:37:38,080
Yeah.

512
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,318
Is often the target that he brings up.

513
00:37:41,404 --> 00:37:42,690
And so I take this personally.

514
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,530
I'm very threatened by his false predictions.

515
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:52,106
Now, is David Knight still with Glenn Beck? I know he's got his own radio show on Iheart or whatever.

516
00:37:52,288 --> 00:37:58,310
David Knight used to work for Infowars, but he got fired.

517
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:00,050
Maybe like a year ago.

518
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,930
He got into a fight with a guy named Steve Patentic.

519
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:07,178
Steve Patentock is this bullshit artist who would lie to Alex about stuff.

520
00:38:07,324 --> 00:38:15,246
And he was saying that all the ballots in the 2020 election were watermarked, and they all were, like, tracked by blockchain.

521
00:38:15,378 --> 00:38:18,690
And so Trump was going to reveal the election was stolen.

522
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:24,290
And David and I was telling Alex not to believe this nonsense, and David and I got fired.

523
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:31,078
You never say that to never say don't believe anything to Alex Jones.

524
00:38:31,174 --> 00:38:32,530
You will get fired.

525
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:33,294
Yeah.

526
00:38:33,452 --> 00:38:35,614
He was a long standing employee.

527
00:38:35,662 --> 00:38:38,262
He had had a heart attack not too long before this.

528
00:38:38,396 --> 00:38:41,218
He had come in on his day off to talk about Glenn Beck.

529
00:38:41,254 --> 00:38:46,400
Years in the past and no consideration given.

530
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:57,006
I've always kind of been a little bit fascinated by Infowars as a workplace, because when they're not on air, obviously something is happening.

531
00:38:57,128 --> 00:38:57,800
Yeah.

532
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,434
I bet they're exactly the same.

533
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:06,558
I bet they're just sitting around the water coolers talking about the same shit they talk about on air.

534
00:39:06,584 --> 00:39:08,118
I bet it's no fucking different.

535
00:39:08,264 --> 00:39:14,970
Do you think that they actually believe the stuff around the water cooler? Or it's like comics pitching jokes to each other.

536
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:27,130
Like, do you think there's something here? Yeah, I think they're the kind of guys that just endlessly talk nonsense.

537
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:33,626
It goes back to when the Bundys took over the wildlife place in Oregon.

538
00:39:33,758 --> 00:39:38,558
At one point, there were eight guys sitting in a circle talking about their military histories.

539
00:39:38,714 --> 00:39:45,058
And then when a documentarian investigated them, none of them been in the military, but they were all trading more.

540
00:39:45,084 --> 00:39:45,310
Sorry.

541
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,330
It's just like that.

542
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,658
I think once it got started, they were yes.

543
00:39:48,684 --> 00:39:50,854
They just sit around talking and they're all yes.

544
00:39:50,892 --> 00:39:59,710
And they, on some level know it's not true, but they're also so fucking deranged that they inherently believe it.

545
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,450
Does that make sure? Yeah.

546
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:06,650
And I think that is what makes the grifting of today more dangerous.

547
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:14,542
Because I think they it's like if you put them on a lie detector, would they pass? I don't know.

548
00:40:14,616 --> 00:40:21,290
But I know if they're around each other, they're not going to admit that it is bullshit.

549
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:21,994
Yeah.

550
00:40:22,092 --> 00:40:28,886
Because that sort of grifting is not okay.

551
00:40:29,008 --> 00:40:33,410
But if you believe it hard enough, then potentially it is true.

552
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:38,438
And that's really like our entire structure of government.

553
00:40:38,584 --> 00:40:48,174
And half of the successful people who give commentary on it are just finding their footing for their own personal benefit.

554
00:40:48,342 --> 00:40:53,826
And when you find an audience, of course you're going to keep believing it.

555
00:40:53,948 --> 00:40:54,838
Air quoting believing.

556
00:40:54,874 --> 00:40:55,362
Yeah.

557
00:40:55,496 --> 00:41:03,838
And the first person to break KFAB in that environment is going to get eaten by the other grift spiders.

558
00:41:03,934 --> 00:41:04,580
Right.

559
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:10,450
And it'll only reinforce the cafe and like, oh, no, you were the one who wasn't.

560
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:15,090
You were going to be there the day when Alex Jones just goes, I've been lying.

561
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:19,580
And they're all like, oh, I know.

562
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:25,520
That'll take some serious AA meetings, I think, before we get there.

563
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:30,286
So it turns out there's one rule at Infowars.

564
00:41:30,418 --> 00:41:34,122
There's only one rule, and you won't believe what it is.

565
00:41:34,316 --> 00:41:38,178
Has there not been a direct of the full year? You're here to not attack Glenn Beck and not talk about him.

566
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:38,646
That's right.

567
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:41,622
Have there been any other directors about anything else? No.

568
00:41:41,756 --> 00:41:42,694
Just tell the truth.

569
00:41:42,742 --> 00:41:44,034
It was very hard to do that.

570
00:41:44,072 --> 00:41:46,798
And don't invite and keep the eyes on stopping the global.

571
00:41:46,834 --> 00:41:47,874
That's right, yeah.

572
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:50,026
Tell the truth, I guess, abstractly.

573
00:41:50,098 --> 00:41:52,590
And leave Glenn Beck alone.

574
00:41:56,190 --> 00:42:00,370
You don't want to attack our other ally that's fighting it's, the globalists.

575
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:03,514
Think about it.

576
00:42:03,612 --> 00:42:04,800
It's the only box.

577
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:09,854
Don't attack Glenn Beck.

578
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:12,398
Rule number two don't attack Glenn Beck.

579
00:42:12,554 --> 00:42:13,620
That's it.

580
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:24,094
I love the moment of are there any other directives? If you're in, you're probably like, oh, shit.

581
00:42:24,202 --> 00:42:27,620
I think I'm supposed to say no, but that's a crazy answer.

582
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:31,820
But he wants he's goading me to say no.

583
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,140
That's it.

584
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:36,010
On someone's keypad.

585
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,230
You can punch people.

586
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,162
You don't need to wear clothes around here.

587
00:42:39,236 --> 00:42:40,294
You can steal.

588
00:42:40,462 --> 00:42:42,342
Just leave Glenn back the fuck away.

589
00:42:42,416 --> 00:42:44,060
Do not hurt that.

590
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:57,706
So one of the things that I find the most fun in these episodes is when people bring out quotes because they're often wrong, and sometimes it's a little silly.

591
00:42:57,778 --> 00:42:59,610
Like this time with David Knight.

592
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:01,614
He whisked this one a little bit.

593
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:07,146
And as Jesse Ventura said, I don't know if it was his original expression, first they assassinate your character, then they assassinate you.

594
00:43:07,208 --> 00:43:09,474
That was Gandhi, okay? That's what Gandhi said.

595
00:43:09,512 --> 00:43:10,038
Okay.

596
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:34,140
to live in an environment where that is just a passing moment.

597
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:45,250
And Gandhi, again, fun fact, it's actually not even a Gandhi quote.

598
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:51,650
It did sound a little, like, aggressive for a Gandhi quote.

599
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:55,166
Gandhi said, Let don't shoot until you see the whites of your eyes.

600
00:43:55,228 --> 00:43:56,474
That was Gandhi? Yeah.

601
00:43:56,632 --> 00:43:59,118
From my cold, dead hand Gandhi.

602
00:43:59,214 --> 00:44:00,558
No, that was stoker.

603
00:44:00,594 --> 00:44:01,350
Steve austin.

604
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:02,322
You're getting a ball.

605
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:03,760
That was gold in my ear.

606
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:06,590
Gandhi 316.

607
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:11,926
Tell me I'm an ass chase.

608
00:44:11,998 --> 00:44:12,870
Gandhi.

609
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:20,170
They have a fraught relationship with quotes on Infowars.

610
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:27,974
We covered his documentary Endgame, and I was fascinated because every quote was fake.

611
00:44:28,142 --> 00:44:33,058
It was just like wall to wall Jefferson quotes that weren't real.

612
00:44:33,144 --> 00:44:35,290
A couple of Hitler quotes that were fake.

613
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:36,970
It was wild.

614
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:46,690
I don't understand how you can take such stock in these quotes and just be like, well, that's actually just from a meme.

615
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:47,878
It's not real.

616
00:44:47,964 --> 00:44:50,066
Well, still, it's a pretty good meme.

617
00:44:50,198 --> 00:44:50,902
It sounds good.

618
00:44:50,916 --> 00:44:51,914
Yeah, it's a good meme.

619
00:44:51,962 --> 00:44:53,410
It's a very good meme.

620
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:57,622
Once you see it in writing, then all bets are off.

621
00:44:57,756 --> 00:44:58,800
It's a thing.

622
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:04,570
So in this next clip, we have alex, I'll be honest with you.

623
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:07,322
I'm not sure if there's much of a point to this clip.

624
00:45:07,466 --> 00:45:08,134
Okay.

625
00:45:08,292 --> 00:45:15,070
I'm playing it because I want you to feel what it's like to have some ramble in your life.

626
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:15,790
Thank you.

627
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,446
It's really just aimless.

628
00:45:18,638 --> 00:45:22,658
They knew when they were flying into flat clouds that was the factories they had to bomb.

629
00:45:22,754 --> 00:45:26,570
I know when I get enemy attached that I'm over the target.

630
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:29,678
So if I get killed or set up let's just get one thing straight.

631
00:45:29,834 --> 00:45:32,026
You didn't have a victory over me near world order.

632
00:45:32,148 --> 00:45:34,210
I knew what I was climbing into.

633
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,420
I knew the cockpit I was getting into.

634
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:39,938
What just happened? I am steering into the flack.

635
00:45:39,974 --> 00:45:42,250
The more I get, the more I know I'm on target.

636
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:46,510
I just want to buy you to understand that, that I'm in this to win it.

637
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,686
I'm not in this because I'm a narcissist.

638
00:45:48,818 --> 00:45:51,154
I'm not in this because I want a big name for myself.

639
00:45:51,312 --> 00:45:53,926
I am in an absolute war that I know is real.

640
00:45:54,048 --> 00:46:00,014
I've committed my full life to it, and I feel like I'm not doing a good enough job to fight these tyrants.

641
00:46:00,182 --> 00:46:04,982
I believe in humanity, and I'm committed, and I want to believe in other libertarian talk show host.

642
00:46:05,066 --> 00:46:06,600
I want to believe in you.

643
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:08,530
I want to beat these people.

644
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:09,780
I want a better world.

645
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:13,282
I want to uphold my family name.

646
00:46:13,476 --> 00:46:14,702
I want to be honorable.

647
00:46:14,786 --> 00:46:20,974
I want to look at the facts and try to give you the most recent historical, morally based analysis I can.

648
00:46:21,072 --> 00:46:22,620
And I'm impure myself.

649
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:24,982
I'm worldly myself.

650
00:46:25,176 --> 00:46:26,378
I'm not perfect, folks.

651
00:46:26,414 --> 00:46:27,686
I'm not on some high horse.

652
00:46:27,758 --> 00:46:29,520
I'm not here lecturing you.

653
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:30,430
Yeah.

654
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,738
So there are long stretches of his show that just are like that.

655
00:46:34,884 --> 00:46:37,726
It's clear he's talking to himself, right? Yeah.

656
00:46:37,788 --> 00:46:40,670
It's just rambling nonsense.

657
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:46,860
Well, and it actually reminds me a lot of the whole Cogan quote, thou doth protest too much.

658
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:53,166
That was actually chae.

659
00:46:53,358 --> 00:46:54,400
Oh, sorry.

660
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:55,526
Damn it.

661
00:46:55,588 --> 00:46:57,530
Well, either way, the point stands.

662
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:16,986
It's kind of fascinating to go and listen to as much of the show as you do, because there are these moments of, like, you're basically just someone who doesn't go to therapy, talking to yourself, talking about yourself in your feelings on air, and it can feel a little pointless.

663
00:47:17,178 --> 00:47:22,730
You know, you're in a good rhythm when you're saying, I'm not a narcissist.

664
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:26,210
Things are going pretty well.

665
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:28,960
It generally means you've been accused of that.

666
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:38,174
But even for him, because it's sort of like the unwinding of his own mind, he's accusing himself and defending himself against himself a little bit.

667
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:41,330
Well, it's a self soothing behavior.

668
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:44,200
That's what he's engaged in.

669
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:47,380
He's expressing this idea too.

670
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:59,214
You get the flak when you're above the target, and that's his way of justifying, like, every negative consequence that comes his way is actually a sign of his virtue.

671
00:47:59,322 --> 00:47:59,980
Right.

672
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:06,950
Every attack is just because I'm so right about everything and it's pretty sad.

673
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:08,570
It's a bummer.

674
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:10,674
Sometimes you're just a dick.

675
00:48:10,842 --> 00:48:18,980
And it's been so effective that it is like it is even then.

676
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:23,262
He was obviously such a powerful figure at that time.

677
00:48:23,396 --> 00:48:33,930
But to think that that has even grown out of that is so depressing because it's like, it's been so effective.

678
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:41,734
I remember when my friend's mom was like, I watch Fox and News because Fox News because it's fair and balanced.

679
00:48:41,842 --> 00:48:44,226
And I was like, well, that's what they're saying.

680
00:48:44,408 --> 00:48:50,974
You know what I mean? What are you talking? Like it's that simple to hack our dumb little brains.

681
00:48:51,142 --> 00:48:51,690
Yeah.

682
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,758
Catch phrases, man.

683
00:48:52,784 --> 00:48:53,154
They work.

684
00:48:53,192 --> 00:48:55,882
Yeah, just ask Gandhi.

685
00:48:56,026 --> 00:48:56,720
Yeah.

686
00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:08,780
So one of the things that actually is fun sort of about Alex's show is that he will come in from breaks with music sometimes and he really gets to feeling it.

687
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:12,334
One of the best that we've heard is Glenn Fry's.

688
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:13,820
You belong to the city.

689
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:17,240
He rocks out over that and it is amazing.

690
00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:25,426
This is a little bit weaker than that, but still a pretty good example of him vibing.

691
00:49:25,618 --> 00:49:34,966
We are marching, my friends, towards what all analysts openly say.

692
00:49:35,088 --> 00:49:49,140
All analysts I've seen on television or read across the political spectrum could easily lead to thermal nuclear war.

693
00:49:50,610 --> 00:50:15,790
Russian submarines carrying supersonic hydrogen bomb tipped cruise missiles are now popping up off the coast of the United States, clearly to launch attacks if given the go ahead codes against US east coast sub basis and aircraft carrier basis.

694
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:22,140
Russia is openly saying that they are prepared for nuclear war.

695
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:33,940
The Kieva of the globalist forces in Ukraine launch attacks on Russian interest.

696
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:36,050
So it's a little dramatic.

697
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:44,980
You can throw some gorillas music behind that and you got to fucking hit track.

698
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:52,790
Yeah, it is a mash up, but it's like it's just a terrible remix.

699
00:50:53,230 --> 00:51:00,760
There is something to be said for Alex talking over music that unfortunately I think I'd buy an album of it.

700
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:05,966
It would be an interesting late career pivot for him to get into that.

701
00:51:06,088 --> 00:51:08,090
It's like Tony Bennett's duet.

702
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:18,206
It's just like he can sort of just bring his spice to the classic Alex Jones doing the great American Song book.

703
00:51:18,328 --> 00:51:19,010
Yeah.

704
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:23,510
It's just the music while he's just talking about the reptilians.

705
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:27,390
Yeah, it's William Shatnery on his album.

706
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:28,142
Yeah, right.

707
00:51:28,276 --> 00:51:28,610
Yeah.

708
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:31,238
It really is a little angrier, maybe.

709
00:51:31,384 --> 00:51:32,080
Yeah.

710
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:37,610
Talking about Russian nuclear subs off the coast, ready to launch.

711
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:38,800
Yeah.

712
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:42,640
I don't think that's responsible, probably.

713
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:44,258
No.

714
00:51:44,344 --> 00:51:48,400
But God, I mean, that version is going to be stuck in my head all day.

715
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:57,746
So we get back to Glenn Beck business because, like I said, this is the top story of the brink of nuclear war.

716
00:51:57,808 --> 00:52:00,158
Plus, that guy heard Glen Beck while he was moving.

717
00:52:00,304 --> 00:52:00,938
Right.

718
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:03,126
And it involves Alex.

719
00:52:03,258 --> 00:52:11,526
And so it's very important, apparently, some people at Fox have told Alex some things that are disconcerting.

720
00:52:11,718 --> 00:52:17,202
I've told that by high level people, I mean repeatedly.

721
00:52:17,226 --> 00:52:18,158
It's not even that big of a deal.

722
00:52:18,184 --> 00:52:21,326
I'd be going into Fox Studios, another show.

723
00:52:21,448 --> 00:52:24,018
They say Glenn Beck is freaking out, climbing walls.

724
00:52:24,174 --> 00:52:26,042
You can't come on now, that's fine.

725
00:52:26,056 --> 00:52:29,478
I'm going over to The View and going over to do CNN.

726
00:52:29,634 --> 00:52:30,674
It's not that big of a deal.

727
00:52:30,712 --> 00:52:34,958
But Glenn Beckon and his, quote, people don't want you in here.

728
00:52:34,984 --> 00:52:38,860
They're throwing fits and they've got pool in the government.

729
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:42,914
And I'm like, what do you mean? And he goes, man, the guy is the government.

730
00:52:43,012 --> 00:52:44,522
Linbeck is the government.

731
00:52:44,716 --> 00:52:45,460
Wow.

732
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:48,894
I can name names, but I'm not going to name names folks.

733
00:52:48,942 --> 00:52:49,540
Okay.

734
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:52,770
He's not going to name names.

735
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:54,698
Global is the government.

736
00:52:54,844 --> 00:52:55,226
Yeah.

737
00:52:55,288 --> 00:53:00,074
No, look, would naming names really help his case? Because it's quite a claim for sure.

738
00:53:00,232 --> 00:53:02,282
But Alex isn't going to do that.

739
00:53:02,416 --> 00:53:03,302
No, he's above it.

740
00:53:03,316 --> 00:53:04,038
He's classic.

741
00:53:04,134 --> 00:53:04,806
Yeah, he's a classic.

742
00:53:04,818 --> 00:53:05,846
He's a classic act.

743
00:53:05,968 --> 00:53:06,650
Yeah.

744
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:08,510
He was actually on the View.

745
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:12,006
He was, yeah, he was talking about Charlie Sheen.

746
00:53:12,198 --> 00:53:21,162
He was in Charlie Sheen had that meltdown on Alex's show.

747
00:53:21,296 --> 00:53:24,440
That was where it all happened.

748
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:31,820
And because Alex was at the center of that, he got invited on The View and just yelled infowars.com a bit.

749
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:39,982
It's pretty surreal, though, to see him sitting there on that set.

750
00:53:40,056 --> 00:53:42,766
That feels like green screen.

751
00:53:42,828 --> 00:53:46,690
I also like that Glenn Beck is climbing the walls like Spiderman.

752
00:53:48,750 --> 00:54:04,920
Glenn Beck is both freaking out over the existence of Alex Jones and the infringement upon Glen Beck's orbit at some of these cable news operators and at the same time is so powerful that he's the government.

753
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:09,902
He got upgraded from the FBI to the whole government, which is pretty impressive.

754
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:11,242
Within like an hour.

755
00:54:11,316 --> 00:54:12,370
Yeah, within an hour.

756
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,342
That's huge.

757
00:54:13,476 --> 00:54:14,160
Yeah.

758
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:30,614
Have you ever seen Glenn Beck's Christmas show? His one man show about Randall the Boy and the bicycle? Have you ever seen it? I have not.

759
00:54:30,652 --> 00:54:31,538
No, sir.

760
00:54:31,684 --> 00:54:33,530
I cannot recommend it enough.

761
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:36,038
The man is out of his fucking mind.

762
00:54:36,184 --> 00:54:46,538
And we watched it in the theater, me and Josh Wilson, and people got mad at us for laughing the right way.

763
00:54:46,564 --> 00:54:51,350
People were very like they were decked out in their full flags and all that shit.

764
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:55,814
I can't imagine a scarier environment to see a movie like that.

765
00:54:55,972 --> 00:55:02,510
It is a deep, deep journey into the mind of Glenn Beck and his fucking outstanding.

766
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:05,870
I've heard some great reviews of his books.

767
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:09,040
I've never read a book.

768
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:10,422
I mean, his books.

769
00:55:10,446 --> 00:55:11,274
I've read books.

770
00:55:11,382 --> 00:55:14,330
I've heard negative reviews of his books.

771
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:19,794
I can imagine he's not going to name names.

772
00:55:19,902 --> 00:55:23,294
No, that's a policy that he has.

773
00:55:23,392 --> 00:55:33,030
But maybe yeah, in a way it shows you that he is honorable when it comes to not outing these sources.

774
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:33,590
Sure.

775
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:36,258
But it's also god damn.

776
00:55:36,294 --> 00:55:42,282
Would it really help? Some of this stuff just to really validate it and just be so fucking helpful.

777
00:55:42,366 --> 00:55:45,482
Could you give us a damn specific, please? Just one.

778
00:55:45,616 --> 00:55:48,446
Maybe name a name just so we could be like, okay, yes.

779
00:55:48,508 --> 00:55:49,430
That name was right.

780
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,934
Now you don't need to anymore.

781
00:55:51,042 --> 00:55:52,190
Well, maybe he will.

782
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,306
Maybe he will.

783
00:55:53,428 --> 00:55:54,254
Glenn back.

784
00:55:54,352 --> 00:55:57,220
You want it, buddy? Maybe I'll name names son.

785
00:55:57,790 --> 00:55:59,354
You want it, you're going to get it.

786
00:55:59,392 --> 00:56:01,406
You want it, you're going to get it.

787
00:56:01,588 --> 00:56:06,170
As I gave you the benefit of the doubt and I knew you were after me and I said, leave me alone.

788
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:19,830
You think the fact that you're Benedict Garnling going to come out? You were spouting White House talking points three days before word for word it came out of Media Matters.

789
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:22,050
You got the memo before they did, bud.

790
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,678
We got your ass.

791
00:56:23,824 --> 00:56:24,530
Whoa.

792
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:32,130
What? You've got them? You want more? We're going to capoladase on all your people now and we're going to put it out for folks.

793
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:36,126
We're going to realize your little base over there is a CIA FBI substation.

794
00:56:36,198 --> 00:56:37,046
Oh, my God.

795
00:56:37,168 --> 00:56:38,466
This is quite a threat.

796
00:56:50,030 --> 00:56:56,840
FBI substation from which he runs the federal government.

797
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:05,166
And we know this because he had the same talking point that Media Matters did.

798
00:57:05,288 --> 00:57:08,638
Three days later, tastes concluded.

799
00:57:08,674 --> 00:57:11,060
Motherfucker, it's over.

800
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:19,530
And I should also say that we only know that this three day thing is happening because Alex is saying it and he's iffy on dates.

801
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:29,554
But again, once you get the dossiers compiled, which I'm sure they were, and put out yeah, I'm sure that was validating.

802
00:57:29,602 --> 00:57:31,110
And corroborated all of it.

803
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:32,562
Well, sure, yeah.

804
00:57:32,636 --> 00:57:36,402
And Glenn Beck went away because he was shamed out of the public.

805
00:57:36,596 --> 00:57:39,726
Well, revealed that he was the government and that's over.

806
00:57:39,908 --> 00:57:40,254
Yeah.

807
00:57:40,292 --> 00:57:43,350
And then he got deposed, I guess because he's no longer the government.

808
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,130
No.

809
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,262
There was a coup.

810
00:57:45,346 --> 00:57:47,158
No, but he still runs the FBI.

811
00:57:47,194 --> 00:57:58,590
Castation kind of implies that it's in between a couple of stations, like in case people need to camp out there for a mission.

812
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:03,018
It's actually a station on a sub.

813
00:58:03,164 --> 00:58:03,798
Think about it.

814
00:58:03,824 --> 00:58:04,510
Whoa.

815
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:06,210
In the middle of Texas.

816
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:12,054
Doesn't he operate out of the house? Maybe that's the high level target that the nuke would say.

817
00:58:12,092 --> 00:58:14,250
You better be careful where he's operating from.

818
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:14,598
Now.

819
00:58:14,624 --> 00:58:17,180
We're getting to Jade Hill, aren't we? Wow.

820
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:18,440
Yeah.

821
00:58:19,310 --> 00:58:23,720
Just got to figure out how the spiders play into this and we are on to something.

822
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:26,180
Man.

823
00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:46,600
What the level of drugs to keep this up? What is the belief on him? Is it Adderall? Is it booze? Is it a cocktail? He's definitely a drunk, for sure.

824
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:48,774
He does his show drunk.

825
00:58:48,822 --> 00:58:54,018
Sometimes less so lately, but in the past, he would be very clearly drunk.

826
00:58:54,054 --> 00:58:59,930
Like one Christmas Eve, he was so drunk he threw a hatchet at one of his cameras.

827
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:02,750
It was madness.

828
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:06,220
Oh, my God.

829
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:20,966
Sometimes he has big knives in the studio.

830
00:59:21,038 --> 00:59:24,910
Sometimes he has, like, a barrett Fordy cow, like cannon.

831
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:31,370
There's a surreality to some of that.

832
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,078
But yes, he had that hatchet.

833
00:59:33,114 --> 00:59:34,240
That was a good day.

834
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:39,270
Rogan has said that Alex told him that he has a problem with Adderall.

835
00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:42,520
And so there is some kind of a stimulant thing right.

836
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:46,106
That keeps the words running.

837
00:59:46,228 --> 00:59:46,900
Yeah.

838
00:59:48,370 --> 00:59:55,218
I think from performing and doing shows, it can be exhausting, even though it doesn't look like it's exhausting.

839
00:59:55,374 --> 01:00:02,342
And what he does is pretty high intensity and not have some kind of a supplement, if you will.

840
01:00:02,476 --> 01:00:05,510
Yeah, that would be great if you just started selling that as the supplement.

841
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:10,314
The Adderall booze combo is pretty fucking ridiculously.

842
01:00:10,482 --> 01:00:19,410
The way that Adderall can keep the gears going no matter what you're throwing at it, if you take enough, is pretty remarkable.

843
01:00:19,590 --> 01:00:32,560
I've certainly had some friends tell me that if you're drinking pretty late, like maybe you're at here in Chicago and someone gives you some cocaine, it balances you out a little bit.

844
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:35,080
Stimulant bamboo have that effect.

845
01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:37,778
Yes.

846
01:00:37,924 --> 01:00:55,280
And I know from having done cocaine at three or four in the morning, but a lot of times it will be the appearance that you're in control, but your memories will not be there to really back that up.

847
01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:59,526
So you will seem fine, but you are out of your mind.

848
01:00:59,648 --> 01:01:03,522
This is how Alex gets away with forgetting that Glenn Beck is the government.

849
01:01:03,656 --> 01:01:04,340
Right.

850
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:07,220
His holes in his memory, sure.

851
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:12,298
But look, so he's got to put together these dossiers right, on Glenn Beck's staff.

852
01:01:12,454 --> 01:01:15,080
And to do that, he's going to need some help.

853
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:21,870
And so he calls out, he puts it out into the universe, obiwan kind of thing.

854
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:24,618
This is one fucking day of a fucking show.

855
01:01:24,704 --> 01:01:26,060
This is one day.

856
01:01:26,990 --> 01:01:28,940
This is fucking crazy.

857
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:30,970
This is Fast Dave.

858
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:34,100
Honestly, this is one of the less crazy.

859
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:37,890
I was worried that some of these clips would be very boring.

860
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:39,920
Wow.

861
01:01:40,310 --> 01:01:42,774
So here is Alex calling for some help.

862
01:01:42,872 --> 01:01:57,918
I wonder what Anonymous is going to do about this? Are you going to let them bring me down? What, to come to my age right now? Tell the enemy he's rolling the Death Star around is going to be clear to fire in five minutes.

863
01:01:58,004 --> 01:02:01,700
What are you going to do? What? I need you to help me.

864
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:03,260
I'm for real.

865
01:02:04,370 --> 01:02:06,020
People want to bring me down.

866
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:07,278
They can bring me down.

867
01:02:07,304 --> 01:02:08,142
They can bring you down.

868
01:02:08,156 --> 01:02:09,126
They can bring Drudge down.

869
01:02:09,188 --> 01:02:10,566
They can bring Rolenette daily down.

870
01:02:10,628 --> 01:02:15,560
They can bring the real liberal media down, the libertarian Thomas Jefferson media down.

871
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:29,302
I wonder if he's talked to anyone, it's because there's no real information.

872
01:02:29,436 --> 01:02:36,490
But it's just evolving in his psychosis to the point now where he's like, look, Anonymous, you're in the crosshairs now.

873
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:37,198
Yeah.

874
01:02:37,344 --> 01:02:40,282
You're just as exposed as I am here.

875
01:02:40,416 --> 01:02:43,020
It's a Glen Beck because he's the government.

876
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:48,178
Glenn Beck will unmask you and take you down.

877
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:51,910
Yeah, I do love that.

878
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:56,458
At this point, Alex is looking at Anonymous as like some kind of a like, they got my back.

879
01:02:56,544 --> 01:02:57,730
Come on, brothers.

880
01:02:58,230 --> 01:03:11,170
Do we even know? Wait, have we heard what Glenn Beck said about him yet? He said that the Infowars wants a revolution and that he didn't want to get involved with the bundes because Infowars was involved.

881
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:20,320
He just made a very nearly offhanded comment and this is what's happening.

882
01:03:20,770 --> 01:03:25,986
He also said that Alex was excusing the racism of Five and Bundy's comments, which Alex wasn't.

883
01:03:26,058 --> 01:03:33,666
But again, when you're dealing with racist time travelers, you have to be open to their racism a little bit, right? You'd be time travelist if you didn't.

884
01:03:33,738 --> 01:03:34,360
Yes.

885
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:37,538
It's just gotten so crazy.

886
01:03:37,624 --> 01:03:46,650
People, too, that it's like I can't remember where we started from because he made those comments.

887
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:52,486
Now they are taking down everything they're called a non.

888
01:03:52,498 --> 01:03:55,966
Anonymous, bring down all of Glenn Beck's operation.

889
01:03:56,098 --> 01:03:58,446
Dave, this is part of the globalist Death Star.

890
01:03:58,568 --> 01:04:00,102
You should be freaked out.

891
01:04:00,236 --> 01:04:00,920
Yeah.

892
01:04:01,490 --> 01:04:03,774
You're ready to fire in five minutes.

893
01:04:03,932 --> 01:04:05,322
Worried right now.

894
01:04:05,516 --> 01:04:19,460
In the past 90 minutes, Glenn Beck has gone from an Am radio show host to cable news host to now he's the government who is going to unmask and take down all of these people.

895
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:27,090
Listen, Anonymous, if you don't stop him now, he's going to get his at out and he's going to storm your base.

896
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:27,860
Yeah.

897
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:39,166
I hate to say this, guys, because if you're having this much of, like, wonderment at this point, I don't know if you can handle the next clip.

898
01:04:39,298 --> 01:04:39,942
Let's go.

899
01:04:40,016 --> 01:04:50,610
I cannot fucking wait because this is something that's kind of normal on his show, but for you, this might be like a lot to take in.

900
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:52,006
I'm going to throw a hatchet.

901
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:52,722
Okay.

902
01:04:52,856 --> 01:04:53,926
I'm going to say a prayer.

903
01:04:53,998 --> 01:05:02,170
God, I recognize that this is a key juncture point that the enemy realizes that we're going exponentially to come after us with their offers.

904
01:05:02,290 --> 01:05:16,362
Please have been a humble serve and try to be the best I can and please protect us and please help us expose the enemies within foreign and domestic and please allow me to continue on in my work so that I can do a better job and continue to wake others up.

905
01:05:16,376 --> 01:05:29,938
Or if it is your will that they destroy me, please let it be an edifying message to all so that we can learn from it and in the end, defeat these enemies within these Benedict Arnold, in the name of your son, Jesus Christ, amen.

906
01:05:30,034 --> 01:05:31,040
Oh, my God.

907
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:42,862
The best prayers always have my enemies, foreign and domestic, within them.

908
01:05:43,056 --> 01:05:45,502
Yeah, man.

909
01:05:45,636 --> 01:05:49,726
To the balls again.

910
01:05:49,788 --> 01:06:08,718
I mean, it's like if you just surround yourself with people who will let you get away with things, this is how you get to the point where you're doing like, pretty much one on one public prayers with God, religion, was really the only thing separating him from Jim Jones.

911
01:06:08,874 --> 01:06:14,018
And then, boom, he prays on air more than you'd think.

912
01:06:14,104 --> 01:06:20,810
And it's suspicious how often the prayers seem to be a performance.

913
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:28,250
He's talking about Glenn Beck in this prayer very clearly.

914
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:31,660
Yeah, he's subpraying back.

915
01:06:37,670 --> 01:06:47,338
Now, if that wasn't too much to take in this next clip, this will give you Whiplash Jarring, because this is immediately after he prays.

916
01:06:47,434 --> 01:06:48,690
This is what he says.

917
01:06:48,860 --> 01:07:04,894
I just ask you all to pray for this broadcast and to pray that all be revealed and that all the veils be torn back from the would be religious cult leader that is the CIA frontman, the FBI frontman, the Justice Department, Obama frontman.

918
01:07:04,942 --> 01:07:06,020
That is going back.

919
01:07:06,830 --> 01:07:07,590
Wow.

920
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,654
And I just pray that that happened.

921
01:07:09,812 --> 01:07:11,600
And if it's God's will, it will.

922
01:07:13,310 --> 01:07:15,260
He likes to invoke God all day.

923
01:07:16,610 --> 01:07:18,598
When I invoke God, I do it very humbly.

924
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:19,830
In God's presence.

925
01:07:22,130 --> 01:07:22,530
Yes.

926
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,510
When Alex does it, it's classy.

927
01:07:25,310 --> 01:07:26,420
Yeah, for sure.

928
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:29,760
Yeah.

929
01:07:43,090 --> 01:07:43,840
man.

930
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:45,700
Tough you have your head around.

931
01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:55,214
It would just make so much sense if the set of info words was just like multiplicity, where there were five of them and they just are kind of swapping in and out.

932
01:07:55,252 --> 01:08:00,714
You've got the religious Jones, the conspiratorial Jones, the musician Jones.

933
01:08:00,882 --> 01:08:05,046
Sure be terrified of spiders, Jones.

934
01:08:05,178 --> 01:08:06,738
Just reading headlines Jones.

935
01:08:06,774 --> 01:08:10,146
Spider Jones, which is the one where you're like, this one is not the best copy.

936
01:08:10,218 --> 01:08:12,458
We've got the spider guy.

937
01:08:12,484 --> 01:08:14,114
We shouldn't let him on air too often.

938
01:08:14,272 --> 01:08:17,790
The very red Alex Jones from that picture.

939
01:08:24,110 --> 01:08:24,860
man.

940
01:08:25,190 --> 01:08:26,790
Orlando Jones.

941
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:28,738
It's not the actor.

942
01:08:28,774 --> 01:08:31,234
It's actually just like a Florida Alex Jones.

943
01:08:31,282 --> 01:08:31,880
Yeah.

944
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:35,130
He has, like, board shorts and a Hawaiian shirt.

945
01:08:38,190 --> 01:08:44,770
It's really remarkable to think that nothing has changed.

946
01:08:48,550 --> 01:08:49,238
No.

947
01:08:49,384 --> 01:08:53,286
In this two hour period that nothing has changed.

948
01:08:53,358 --> 01:08:56,690
Except for potentially the level of intoxication or something.

949
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:59,402
Or just like the ratings or whatever.

950
01:08:59,476 --> 01:09:03,314
Just the fact that he's just going I don't think he's drunk, to be fair.

951
01:09:03,352 --> 01:09:08,634
I can usually tell like these he has little tells and he seems pretty sober.

952
01:09:08,742 --> 01:09:09,878
But here's the thing.

953
01:09:10,024 --> 01:09:12,950
Every episode is essentially an adventure for him.

954
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:21,018
He steps out his front door when he starts the show and who knows, right? He could end up in Mordor.

955
01:09:21,114 --> 01:09:23,526
He could end up just at the other side of the Shire.

956
01:09:23,598 --> 01:09:25,926
Who knows? Madness.

957
01:09:26,058 --> 01:09:30,880
It's who knows where the that is fucking amazing.

958
01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:38,478
We have learned just an immense amount, but we have more to learn about Glen Beck.

959
01:09:38,574 --> 01:09:40,790
Good, because we've learned he's the FBI.

960
01:09:44,110 --> 01:09:46,300
Hold on, maybe not.

961
01:09:46,870 --> 01:09:49,338
Maybe he's above Obama.

962
01:09:49,434 --> 01:09:57,194
I'm so tired of the trail of the treason I'm so tired of the dishonor I want to think more of people I want to believe that everything I was told.

963
01:09:57,232 --> 01:09:59,882
About people wasn't true, even though it's been proven to be right.

964
01:09:59,956 --> 01:10:01,278
There's no FEMA camps.

965
01:10:01,374 --> 01:10:04,660
Ron Paul has a thing called the money Bomb to blow up the government.

966
01:10:05,290 --> 01:10:15,520
He said that when the first money bombs are going on for six months, back when he said that 67 years ago, the army needs to be used against these people.

967
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:22,274
That was the Southern Property Law Center Media Matters line.

968
01:10:22,312 --> 01:10:24,402
Then I kept saying, these are government lines.

969
01:10:24,486 --> 01:10:27,938
These are hardcore inside lines first, not later.

970
01:10:28,024 --> 01:10:30,050
He doesn't repeat the lines later.

971
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,614
He progenerates.

972
01:10:31,782 --> 01:10:34,960
He gives birth, he coins them.

973
01:10:36,430 --> 01:10:38,870
He gets the memo first, folks.

974
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:41,658
And I say he works for Obama.

975
01:10:41,694 --> 01:10:42,820
It's above that.

976
01:10:45,490 --> 01:10:55,994
And then I think about, how did I get into such a hardcore game? How am I, some guy from Dallas, Texas, in the middle of this? Ladies and gentlemen, there's no secret room telling me what to do.

977
01:10:56,092 --> 01:10:57,710
I don't have any advisors.

978
01:10:58,150 --> 01:11:05,670
I'm just here real going up against these people, like bragging.

979
01:11:06,230 --> 01:11:08,480
Nobody's talking to me about this stuff.

980
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:15,394
I'm just ripping this shit out.

981
01:11:15,492 --> 01:11:17,820
Believe it or not, I am coming up with this.

982
01:11:18,330 --> 01:11:29,002
Dealing is like, if you're Glen Beck, you're like, okay, so how do I counter this? Yeah, well, if you're funsex people, you're going and you're going.

983
01:11:29,016 --> 01:11:31,642
Hey, just so you know, I guess Alex heard some of the things you said.

984
01:11:31,716 --> 01:11:34,018
What you think? He's pretty pissed off.

985
01:11:34,104 --> 01:11:34,978
I mean, whatever.

986
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:35,866
This is media.

987
01:11:35,928 --> 01:11:36,802
This can happen.

988
01:11:36,936 --> 01:11:38,542
Hey, when you have a second, we have it.

989
01:11:38,556 --> 01:11:40,366
No, someone told me about the Alex Jones thing.

990
01:11:40,428 --> 01:11:45,766
No, it's gotten a little bit more out of control in the last 15 minutes.

991
01:11:45,888 --> 01:11:47,940
Yeah, in the last 15 minutes.

992
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:53,700
I guess now his pitch is that you are pretty much inside the government, working for the government.

993
01:11:54,090 --> 01:11:55,140
That's crazy.

994
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:58,994
You have a sub FBI CIA station.

995
01:11:59,102 --> 01:11:59,798
Hey, Glen.

996
01:11:59,894 --> 01:12:00,554
Glen.

997
01:12:00,722 --> 01:12:01,234
Sorry.

998
01:12:01,332 --> 01:12:03,240
I know you're trying to get some work done.

999
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:07,690
Yeah, there's a new update.

1000
01:12:08,610 --> 01:12:20,362
So it seems now that he is suggesting that you're sort of coming up with the talking points for the government and that you're no longer part of the government.

1001
01:12:20,436 --> 01:12:23,206
You maybe are the government.

1002
01:12:23,388 --> 01:12:25,618
And he bit his right arm on the fact that you are.

1003
01:12:25,644 --> 01:12:27,360
He'll cut his arm off if you're not.

1004
01:12:28,830 --> 01:12:31,534
Sometimes I just think about how I wanted to be a stand up.

1005
01:12:31,692 --> 01:12:32,438
Hey, Glenn.

1006
01:12:32,474 --> 01:12:32,818
Sorry.

1007
01:12:32,904 --> 01:12:34,630
I know it's only been eight minutes.

1008
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,162
Yeah, you're above Obama now.

1009
01:12:37,236 --> 01:12:38,710
You might be Obama.

1010
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:45,600
How am I supposed to say anything? The show's got another 2 hours.

1011
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:49,402
He's been running for 17 minutes.

1012
01:13:09,070 --> 01:13:13,850
It's definitely a heavy day for Alex in terms of, like, Escalating.

1013
01:13:15,010 --> 01:13:18,926
It doesn't always snowball quite like this.

1014
01:13:19,108 --> 01:13:20,418
It feels druggy.

1015
01:13:20,454 --> 01:13:25,554
It feels like he's been popping pills as this has been going, looking at snowballs.

1016
01:13:25,722 --> 01:13:29,298
Maybe they just have a fog machine in the studio.

1017
01:13:29,394 --> 01:13:30,306
But it just releases.

1018
01:13:30,378 --> 01:13:31,250
Adderall.

1019
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:33,510
Vaporized Adderall.

1020
01:13:33,630 --> 01:13:34,554
That's a good theory.

1021
01:13:34,602 --> 01:13:35,980
We're onto something here.

1022
01:13:37,090 --> 01:13:40,970
Is anger a drug? It kind of is for some folks.

1023
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:52,506
It is in a way, too, where it's like he's not shouting at his friends at a bar.

1024
01:13:52,688 --> 01:14:01,330
He recognizes the people are listening to this shit, and if they're eating up the trash, that makes him want to throw more trash.

1025
01:14:01,450 --> 01:14:05,290
And as the day goes on, the trash piles have to get bigger and crazier.

1026
01:14:05,410 --> 01:14:09,090
And so now he's just sort of slamming around in a pile.

1027
01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:14,142
That's one of the problems with this style of broadcast in general.

1028
01:14:14,276 --> 01:14:14,538
Yeah.

1029
01:14:14,564 --> 01:14:15,366
The whole media.

1030
01:14:15,488 --> 01:14:21,690
I've had friends that have gone completely insane because they're just in a room talking to themselves on YouTube.

1031
01:14:23,390 --> 01:14:29,130
It's a bad medium if you're alone and no one is going, hey, check yourself a little bit here.

1032
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:40,854
If you don't have a boss and a lot of the stuff that you're talking about is kind of extreme, then people respond to the extreme stuff, and then you kind of lean into that.

1033
01:14:40,952 --> 01:14:56,600
And how are you exciting if you're used to saying extreme stuff like, it's a downward spiral and tomorrow you need to say some crazier shit like, what's Glenn Beck going to be tomorrow? Yeah.

1034
01:14:57,290 --> 01:15:01,654
We all have Washington subs ready to knock America.

1035
01:15:01,702 --> 01:15:03,750
And Glenn Beck is above Obama.

1036
01:15:15,330 --> 01:15:19,390
I'm going to have George on our Ppublic or whatever.

1037
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:20,160
Yes.

1038
01:15:20,730 --> 01:15:28,034
But magic coming back around and then being friends with this guy after that be like me being friends with Jen Kirkman.

1039
01:15:28,082 --> 01:15:29,542
It's not something that can happen.

1040
01:15:29,676 --> 01:15:30,838
I think it'll happen.

1041
01:15:30,984 --> 01:15:37,078
To be fair, I think Alex has said way worse things about Glenn back than this.

1042
01:15:37,164 --> 01:15:39,370
This could be argued to be a compliment.

1043
01:15:39,930 --> 01:15:40,680
Yes.

1044
01:15:41,310 --> 01:15:44,698
In a way it's a scary compliment, but in a way it is.

1045
01:15:44,844 --> 01:15:46,886
You are higher than Obama.

1046
01:15:47,018 --> 01:15:47,710
Yeah.

1047
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:50,650
You know who's higher than Obama? Alex Jones.

1048
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:53,114
He is higher as fuck.

1049
01:15:53,162 --> 01:15:53,760
Yeah.

1050
01:15:54,450 --> 01:16:01,150
But it's definitely an insult or an accusation that involves competence.

1051
01:16:02,010 --> 01:16:05,314
You are so competent that you are above the president.

1052
01:16:05,472 --> 01:16:07,366
Anonymous, let's go.

1053
01:16:07,548 --> 01:16:07,894
Yeah.

1054
01:16:07,932 --> 01:16:13,260
I need a giant team of faceless hackers in order to take you down.

1055
01:16:14,010 --> 01:16:16,430
I can rationalize that as being a positive.

1056
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:20,510
Yeah, it's a scary compliment, but it's a compliment.

1057
01:16:20,690 --> 01:16:22,442
This was from 2014.

1058
01:16:22,526 --> 01:16:29,950
So did Anonymous come to help him? I can't remember about the Glen back on Mastermind.

1059
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:33,710
We saw Obama's birth certificate.

1060
01:16:34,510 --> 01:16:35,560
He was back.

1061
01:16:36,370 --> 01:16:38,942
Actually, Alex doesn't believe the birth certificate stuff.

1062
01:16:39,076 --> 01:16:39,794
He did.

1063
01:16:39,892 --> 01:16:42,160
Oh, my God, what a line.

1064
01:16:44,230 --> 01:16:58,902
He initially believed it, but then he realized that it was a trick because the people like the Obamas put it out knowing that people like Alex and the right wing community were racist, and so they would jump on top of it and take the bait.

1065
01:16:58,986 --> 01:17:00,702
It's a false flag birth certificate.

1066
01:17:00,786 --> 01:17:01,682
You bet.

1067
01:17:01,876 --> 01:17:08,870
In reality, Obama's dad is Frank Marshall Davis sorry, is a communist guy.

1068
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:09,760
I don't know.

1069
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:15,054
I haven't taken this line too much further than that.

1070
01:17:15,152 --> 01:17:17,600
He made a documentary about it at some point.

1071
01:17:18,230 --> 01:17:22,366
He stole a documentary about it called Dreams of My Real Father.

1072
01:17:22,498 --> 01:17:24,510
Oh, my Lord, what a title.

1073
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:27,980
It's still a bit racist, to be honest.

1074
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:31,114
It was a different time, Dan.

1075
01:17:31,282 --> 01:17:34,770
Alex is a time traveler is a time, for God's sake.

1076
01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:47,058
So at this point, we've entered the sort of home stretch of the show, and Alex brings on Joseph Farrah, the guy who runs World Net Daily, onto the program.

1077
01:17:47,144 --> 01:17:47,960
Oh, God.

1078
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:53,026
We're not going to listen to well, just one clip of it because it's pretty boring.

1079
01:17:53,158 --> 01:17:59,250
It's mostly about how the Clintons wanted to take him out, and I don't know how that's relevant.

1080
01:17:59,690 --> 01:18:02,122
Take out Alex or the world net daily.

1081
01:18:02,146 --> 01:18:09,822
World Net Daily back in the we're in 2014, sort of getting credibility off that.

1082
01:18:09,896 --> 01:18:11,638
They did did they end up murdered? They didn't.

1083
01:18:11,674 --> 01:18:12,054
Okay.

1084
01:18:12,152 --> 01:18:20,730
Because I'm not sure if he got murdered and then this is a clone or an impossible no, but they were close because he was asking too many questions about Vince Foster.

1085
01:18:22,790 --> 01:18:24,320
There's the buzz name.

1086
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:26,754
Yeah.

1087
01:18:26,912 --> 01:18:33,126
So far one of his big points is that we got to stick together.

1088
01:18:33,188 --> 01:18:40,966
There's not many of us who are in this, and he accidentally includes Glenn Beck in his list of names.

1089
01:18:41,038 --> 01:18:41,838
Oh, yes.

1090
01:18:41,924 --> 01:18:50,898
For a long time when I started the World Net earlier bare years, I thought to myself, I wonder why nobody else is doing this.

1091
01:18:51,044 --> 01:18:56,226
I wonder why nobody else is saying, hey, we're having a modest degree of success here.

1092
01:18:56,348 --> 01:19:03,010
Why isn't anybody trying to prey? Finally, after many years, there have been info wars.

1093
01:19:03,130 --> 01:19:04,138
Breitbarts.

1094
01:19:04,234 --> 01:19:05,430
Daily Callers.

1095
01:19:06,590 --> 01:19:07,770
Glenn Beck.

1096
01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:16,674
Now we have some other folks out there joining us, and we got to make sure that we don't split hairs with them.

1097
01:19:16,772 --> 01:19:19,602
The other side wants to have a united front.

1098
01:19:19,796 --> 01:19:23,274
Where's our united front? I totally agree.

1099
01:19:23,312 --> 01:19:28,434
We talk about this every time on the phone or on air, and Savage is doing that.

1100
01:19:28,472 --> 01:19:29,420
Good for him.

1101
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:38,878
I mean, the attacks and I'm not going to bring it up, it's just Beck saying that, quote, I want a violent revolution and a civil war when I say the opposite, that I'm a racist covering up for Bundy.

1102
01:19:39,034 --> 01:19:40,494
I mean, maybe you're right.

1103
01:19:40,532 --> 01:19:41,866
Maybe he's just doing it out of fear.

1104
01:19:41,938 --> 01:19:42,690
But it doesn't matter.

1105
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:46,402
I'm being thrown into the bus here, and it's very creepy.

1106
01:19:46,486 --> 01:19:48,946
And I'm just glad that you're an honorable person, Joseph FARA.

1107
01:19:49,018 --> 01:19:50,598
Look forward to seeing you next week.

1108
01:19:50,624 --> 01:19:51,886
And I'm glad you're not a coward.

1109
01:19:52,018 --> 01:19:52,482
All right.

1110
01:19:52,556 --> 01:19:53,430
God bless.

1111
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:56,014
That's how I end my interviews.

1112
01:19:56,062 --> 01:20:00,406
But really, every lunch I have anybody, I ended up saying, I'm glad you're not a coward.

1113
01:20:00,478 --> 01:20:02,180
That's always how I end things.

1114
01:20:04,130 --> 01:20:06,150
I do it after someone orders.

1115
01:20:07,310 --> 01:20:08,518
I'm glad you're not a coward.

1116
01:20:08,554 --> 01:20:10,830
You went with fries instead of potato salad.

1117
01:20:12,170 --> 01:20:23,218
I mean, it really is amazing to have said all the things you've said and then have this guy dropped Glenn Beck and be like, well, look, to be honest, I'm not a huge Glen Beck fan.

1118
01:20:23,254 --> 01:20:29,426
It's like, yeah, there's some dissonance.

1119
01:20:29,558 --> 01:20:33,914
How do you not say to that guy? He says that about going back, and you go, well, he has a substation.

1120
01:20:33,962 --> 01:20:35,230
He runs the FBI.

1121
01:20:37,870 --> 01:20:42,830
I think this question answers itself, and that is that Josephara is not a coward.

1122
01:20:43,150 --> 01:20:43,900
Right.

1123
01:20:44,350 --> 01:20:51,698
Bringing this up would inevitably lead to some pushback, and I think that's probably why just go along, to get along.

1124
01:20:51,784 --> 01:20:53,294
None of this means anything anyway.

1125
01:20:53,392 --> 01:21:02,342
Alex I actually believe that going back is above Obama, but it's so clear there that that's the case because he uses it in the wrap up.

1126
01:21:02,416 --> 01:21:04,302
Well, to be honest, I'm not a huge Glenn Beck fan.

1127
01:21:04,326 --> 01:21:07,266
He says Civil war, but anyway, potato, potato.

1128
01:21:07,338 --> 01:21:08,620
Great to have you on.

1129
01:21:10,690 --> 01:21:12,254
I just got to defend myself.

1130
01:21:12,412 --> 01:21:13,958
I got to defend myself a little bit.

1131
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:15,710
He might be in charge of the globalist Death Star.

1132
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:16,466
We're not sure.

1133
01:21:16,528 --> 01:21:20,330
Anyway, little help from my friends is going to play us out anonymous.

1134
01:21:21,370 --> 01:21:22,610
From Anonymous.

1135
01:21:25,070 --> 01:21:27,814
Yeah, it's silly.

1136
01:21:27,982 --> 01:21:29,394
Things don't make sense.

1137
01:21:29,492 --> 01:21:31,590
And that's just part of the infowar.

1138
01:21:32,330 --> 01:21:38,858
Man in this third hour of his show, he was interviewing Joseph Farrah.

1139
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:49,118
And then the premise was basically that he was going to take calls, but time essentially runs out and too much time complaining about Glenn Beck.

1140
01:21:49,214 --> 01:21:50,822
And so there's no calls.

1141
01:21:50,966 --> 01:21:57,346
And Alex is feeling a little bit like, you know, I'm cool, I'm a cool guy.

1142
01:21:57,468 --> 01:21:59,626
And that's kind of the vibe he wants to go out on.

1143
01:21:59,688 --> 01:22:00,842
These globalists are evil.

1144
01:22:00,866 --> 01:22:02,522
I said I take calls, but I won't.

1145
01:22:02,606 --> 01:22:03,660
I'm out of time.

1146
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:09,700
It's so creepy to be targeted by the White House going back.

1147
01:22:11,230 --> 01:22:14,020
The average person is scared of what their neighbor thinks of them.

1148
01:22:15,370 --> 01:22:25,134
Every once in a while, I'll be in a restaurant or walking down the street or a store in some socialist levels of overall court, idiot, and I hate you like a kick your butter.

1149
01:22:25,182 --> 01:22:28,818
But if you're looking for Cooch man or boo boo, the more table.

1150
01:22:28,854 --> 01:22:29,834
That's happened a few times.

1151
01:22:29,932 --> 01:22:31,660
This is some liberal thing they do.

1152
01:22:33,610 --> 01:22:34,840
Shame on you.

1153
01:22:35,290 --> 01:22:37,142
And it just means nothing to me.

1154
01:22:37,276 --> 01:22:44,982
I was over to buddies once at his local community pool hot tub, and these trendy swimmers, they got Alex Jones.

1155
01:22:45,006 --> 01:22:46,142
I think you're just grace in.

1156
01:22:46,156 --> 01:22:51,738
A couple of months ago, weldon was there.

1157
01:22:51,764 --> 01:22:52,940
He was over there with me.

1158
01:22:55,470 --> 01:23:00,062
We had a few beers and I just looked at them and I just kept talking to them and they laughed.

1159
01:23:00,086 --> 01:23:01,954
And my buddies laughed because it meant nothing to me.

1160
01:23:02,052 --> 01:23:05,602
Those guys thought them laughing at me would upset me.

1161
01:23:05,676 --> 01:23:06,850
It didn't upset him.

1162
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:08,940
He just talking about it.

1163
01:23:14,110 --> 01:23:19,922
I always find that to be, like, really sincere and convincing when people don't bother me.

1164
01:23:20,056 --> 01:23:21,458
Yeah, don't bother me at all.

1165
01:23:21,604 --> 01:23:23,702
I'm talking about it here because I'm fine with it.

1166
01:23:23,716 --> 01:23:26,142
I was just at a community poolhot tub.

1167
01:23:26,286 --> 01:23:28,718
Garrison seemed to discuss you a little bit.

1168
01:23:28,744 --> 01:23:31,490
You were taken aback by the community pool, first of all.

1169
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:32,550
Community pool.

1170
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:35,834
I'm like, is Alex Jones going to a community pool? But that's not crazy.

1171
01:23:35,932 --> 01:23:40,242
But community hot tub just has, like, weird kind of orgy vibes.

1172
01:23:40,326 --> 01:23:44,418
You know what I mean? Yes, community hot tub.

1173
01:23:44,514 --> 01:23:45,738
It's like a community pool.

1174
01:23:45,774 --> 01:23:46,454
I'm like, all right.

1175
01:23:46,492 --> 01:23:48,222
Somewhere for the kids to go on the weekends.

1176
01:23:48,246 --> 01:23:49,518
It's the community hot tub.

1177
01:23:49,554 --> 01:23:51,246
Like, all right, you fucking creep.

1178
01:23:51,378 --> 01:23:56,570
Yeah, the part after the slash was, yeah, communitypool hot tub.

1179
01:23:56,950 --> 01:24:06,198
And also just picturing Alex remind me, like, when they put Bugs Bunny in a cauldron and try to cook him like Alex Jones carrot.

1180
01:24:06,354 --> 01:24:09,100
Yeah, just Elmer Fudd carroting him up.

1181
01:24:10,270 --> 01:24:15,806
What color does Alex Jones turn in a hot tub? It's lobster Town, man.

1182
01:24:15,928 --> 01:24:16,250
Yeah.

1183
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:19,074
I mean, seriously, he must start crustacheining.

1184
01:24:19,242 --> 01:24:20,414
Well, here's the thing.

1185
01:24:20,512 --> 01:24:21,998
You guys don't listen to a ton of this.

1186
01:24:22,024 --> 01:24:25,790
You wouldn't know, but a lot of Alex's stories take place in hot tubs.

1187
01:24:29,510 --> 01:24:38,238
He has a famous story about being in a hot tub, and a couple of globalists came in, and we're going to get you.

1188
01:24:38,324 --> 01:24:40,462
They were, like, threatening him in the hot tub.

1189
01:24:48,390 --> 01:24:48,682
by.

1190
01:24:48,696 --> 01:24:50,098
Globalists in hot water a lot.

1191
01:24:50,124 --> 01:24:52,690
He might want to stay clear, some of these hot bodies.

1192
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:57,810
Is there a space in here? I'm a globalist.

1193
01:24:57,990 --> 01:24:59,066
Excuse me.

1194
01:24:59,248 --> 01:25:01,862
So it says six people at a time.

1195
01:25:01,936 --> 01:25:08,382
Is that six regular humans? How many globalists may squeeze in now? Don't mind my eight legs.

1196
01:25:08,466 --> 01:25:08,786
Yeah.

1197
01:25:08,848 --> 01:25:09,820
Pardon me.

1198
01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:11,322
I'm in a rock band.

1199
01:25:11,346 --> 01:25:12,146
You see.

1200
01:25:12,328 --> 01:25:18,650
Spider comes out and what do you do, sir? I'm a globalist.

1201
01:25:20,050 --> 01:25:21,446
It's on the business card.

1202
01:25:21,568 --> 01:25:22,758
Hey, I'm a globalist.

1203
01:25:22,794 --> 01:25:24,580
We're both in the globalist business.

1204
01:25:25,630 --> 01:25:28,722
So this brings us to the end of this episode.

1205
01:25:28,806 --> 01:25:37,578
And I don't know if you have some feelings on making it through something of basically your birthday, your show's birthday.

1206
01:25:37,674 --> 01:25:43,286
Yeah, at least everything has gone so much better since then.

1207
01:25:43,468 --> 01:25:44,200
Yeah.

1208
01:25:49,670 --> 01:25:52,280
He's just such a train wreck figure.

1209
01:25:53,510 --> 01:26:02,600
But it's almost like, I guess you think of him when you don't know as much as you all do.

1210
01:26:04,850 --> 01:26:06,258
He is dangerous in so many ways.

1211
01:26:06,284 --> 01:26:09,080
But this is the mind of a child.

1212
01:26:10,610 --> 01:26:12,582
It's just a child's mind.

1213
01:26:12,716 --> 01:26:15,474
And it's just pretty simple what's going on.

1214
01:26:15,572 --> 01:26:19,266
And it's, I guess, very effective for those who are in.

1215
01:26:19,448 --> 01:26:23,514
But there's really not much to it.

1216
01:26:23,552 --> 01:26:28,338
He's just trying to fucking keep the train running.

1217
01:26:28,424 --> 01:26:30,510
Just keep the words coming out.

1218
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:32,360
Create the straw man.

1219
01:26:33,110 --> 01:26:34,254
He's got his terms.

1220
01:26:34,352 --> 01:26:35,386
They're very effective.

1221
01:26:35,458 --> 01:26:44,410
And to what you were saying, like, he walks out his door, and he's like every day he's a Pixar movie for him.

1222
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:45,466
Yeah, I'm certain.

1223
01:26:45,528 --> 01:26:52,718
He has essentially no preparation for anything, just seed of his pants.

1224
01:26:52,874 --> 01:26:59,602
And that's how you can get these ridiculous things, like an entire show where he's escalatingly accusing Glen Beck of stuff.

1225
01:26:59,736 --> 01:27:00,420
Right.

1226
01:27:00,990 --> 01:27:04,054
Well, I have nothing else really to talk about.

1227
01:27:04,152 --> 01:27:09,180
I've already made people scared about this nuclear war thing, and I got nowhere else to go with that.

1228
01:27:10,410 --> 01:27:27,382
What can I say? In between Hawking survival items, he really is like when people like, you have a friend that did something, and then in your head, you're like, oh, I'm going to say this to him and this to him, and then it kind of spirals out and you're just thinking of all this stuff.

1229
01:27:27,516 --> 01:27:29,566
But that's all he does on Show.

1230
01:27:29,748 --> 01:27:31,162
It's the kind of thought you have.

1231
01:27:31,176 --> 01:27:32,798
And then you go, oh, no, it's just Frank.

1232
01:27:32,954 --> 01:27:34,500
I just fucking call him.

1233
01:27:35,010 --> 01:27:37,320
But he just goes for hours.

1234
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:41,340
It's a guy spiraling out for fucking hours.

1235
01:27:42,870 --> 01:27:52,320
If this was so hugely important, it probably should have gotten on his radar in another way than a guy who worked for him was moving.

1236
01:27:54,030 --> 01:28:01,200
Well, again, like I said, the guy who was moving, his brother heard it and told the guy who was moving I mean, it's like, come on.

1237
01:28:01,710 --> 01:28:03,286
God, it's so good.

1238
01:28:03,468 --> 01:28:05,890
We will reveal his sources and what he does.

1239
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:08,650
It's a guy who works for me, his brother.

1240
01:28:09,390 --> 01:28:14,110
One of his big sources of information in the present day is his wife's tennis partner.

1241
01:28:15,570 --> 01:28:17,820
He gets a lot of deep intel from her.

1242
01:28:20,650 --> 01:28:22,070
This shows stupid.

1243
01:28:24,650 --> 01:28:35,514
So the next day, is he just over completely and onto something else, or does he continue on? Will he continue on with something like this, or will he just drop it? It changes.

1244
01:28:35,672 --> 01:28:36,318
I'm not sure.

1245
01:28:36,344 --> 01:28:39,582
I haven't listened to the next day's episode, so I couldn't say for sure.

1246
01:28:39,716 --> 01:28:44,490
Sometimes it becomes a little bit of a crusade, and then sometimes he'll get distracted.

1247
01:28:45,350 --> 01:28:45,894
Sure.

1248
01:28:45,992 --> 01:28:55,470
Or like he went on Piers Morgan's show and yelled at him about guns because Alex started a petition to get Piers Morgan deported.

1249
01:28:57,350 --> 01:28:58,050
That's great.

1250
01:28:58,100 --> 01:28:59,382
Finally we agree.

1251
01:28:59,576 --> 01:28:59,970
Yeah.

1252
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:07,446
And then he went on Piers Morgan show and started yelling at him about how, like, you guys tried to take our guns in 1776.

1253
01:29:07,628 --> 01:29:12,440
And that became, like, two weeks of his show.

1254
01:29:17,210 --> 01:29:23,300
Don't tell Alex that you for weeks.

1255
01:29:25,430 --> 01:29:27,678
That's actually what the War of Independence is about.

1256
01:29:27,824 --> 01:29:29,310
It was gun confiscation.

1257
01:29:29,870 --> 01:29:30,882
Oh, my God.

1258
01:29:31,016 --> 01:29:33,778
Well, thank you for having us on, Dan.

1259
01:29:33,874 --> 01:29:34,820
Thank you.

1260
01:29:35,750 --> 01:29:48,766
I'm sure almost everybody who listens to our show be aware of your show, the Dollop, but is there anything else you want to direct people's attention to that they should check out? I mean, I would keep your eyes on Glenn Beck.

1261
01:29:48,838 --> 01:29:51,766
Yeah, keep your eyes peeled.

1262
01:29:51,838 --> 01:29:55,110
We have a virtual show we're doing September 8.

1263
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:58,760
We're touring, so you can go to Dollopodcast.com.

1264
01:29:59,090 --> 01:30:04,834
I'll be recording some shows in Seattle, Portland, and vancouver.

1265
01:30:04,882 --> 01:30:09,990
You could go to Gareth Reynolds.com for those stand up shows and listen to the dog.

1266
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:12,102
Like you said, hell yeah.

1267
01:30:12,236 --> 01:30:12,920
Save.

1268
01:30:13,790 --> 01:30:14,900
I got nothing.

1269
01:30:17,270 --> 01:30:18,174
Fair enough.

1270
01:30:18,332 --> 01:30:19,342
Check me out on Twitter.

1271
01:30:19,366 --> 01:30:20,550
I'm yelling at people.

1272
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:23,120
Yeah, if you can get into Dave's Twitter bar.

1273
01:30:25,830 --> 01:30:27,650
Not that protected status.

1274
01:30:27,770 --> 01:30:28,440
Yeah.

1275
01:30:28,890 --> 01:30:36,420
Do you think Twitter ends with me having blocked everybody on Twitter, just yelling at myself? I think it ends when you realize you can block yourself.

1276
01:30:39,910 --> 01:30:46,660
If you do end up blocking everybody and you're just yelling at yourself, eventually this episode of Alex is going to be your future.

1277
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:49,926
Yeah.

1278
01:30:50,048 --> 01:30:51,438
Well, thanks again, guys.

1279
01:30:51,584 --> 01:30:55,018
It's been a real pleasure and hopefully can do it again sometime.

1280
01:30:55,114 --> 01:30:56,154
Yeah, love to.

1281
01:30:56,252 --> 01:30:56,586
Thanks.

1282
01:30:56,648 --> 01:30:57,234
Awesome.

1283
01:30:57,392 --> 01:30:58,938
Andy and Janzis, you're on the air.

1284
01:30:58,964 --> 01:30:59,910
Thanks for holding.

1285
01:31:01,370 --> 01:31:02,134
So, Alex.

1286
01:31:02,182 --> 01:31:03,106
I'm a first time caller.

1287
01:31:03,118 --> 01:31:03,874
I'm a huge fan.

1288
01:31:03,922 --> 01:31:04,710
I love your work.

1289
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:05,050
I loved.
