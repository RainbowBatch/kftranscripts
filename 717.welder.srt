1
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,470
Not knowledge fights.

2
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,382
I am sweating knowledgebuddy.com.

3
00:00:20,456 --> 00:00:21,490
It's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,850
I have great respect for Knowledge.

5
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,402
I'm sick of them posing as if they're good guys.

6
00:00:27,476 --> 00:00:27,786
Chang.

7
00:00:27,848 --> 00:00:29,240
We are the bad guys.

8
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:52,906
I love your room.

9
00:00:53,028 --> 00:00:54,250
Knowledgefight.

10
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,240
Knowledgefight.com.

11
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,158
I love you.

12
00:00:59,244 --> 00:01:00,446
Hey, Rebel.

13
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:00,898
Welcome back.

14
00:01:00,924 --> 00:01:01,694
Knowledge, right? I'm Dan.

15
00:01:01,742 --> 00:01:02,402
I'm Jordan.

16
00:01:02,426 --> 00:01:07,286
We're a couple of dudes like to sit around worship at the altar of Celine and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

17
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:09,806
Oh, indeed we are, Dan.

18
00:01:09,878 --> 00:01:12,446
Jordan, Jordan, Jordan.

19
00:01:12,518 --> 00:01:13,282
Quick question for you.

20
00:01:13,296 --> 00:01:18,790
What's up? What's your bright spot today, buddy? My bright spot today, I guess, is that we're back in the saddle.

21
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,930
Everything is back to normal.

22
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,222
Yes, it was very nice.

23
00:01:22,296 --> 00:01:27,782
And a big thank you to Dave and Gareth for filling in your seat on Monday.

24
00:01:27,866 --> 00:01:29,026
Fantastic job.

25
00:01:29,148 --> 00:01:37,450
I would also like to apologize to the audience that apparently that whole spider thing is maybe based on anti Semitic conspiracies from history.

26
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,266
Also, maybe it's just a spider.

27
00:01:39,338 --> 00:01:42,422
I mean, sometimes a spider is just a spider.

28
00:01:42,506 --> 00:01:43,958
It's not always a penis.

29
00:01:44,054 --> 00:01:45,960
It's hard to say in this case.

30
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:52,906
Freud said that, but, yeah, I didn't realize that at the time, but, yeah, it's nice to be back.

31
00:01:52,968 --> 00:01:53,974
Yeah, absolutely.

32
00:01:54,132 --> 00:01:55,514
Thank you for the bath bombs.

33
00:01:55,562 --> 00:01:57,600
Oh, you are very welcome, my friend.

34
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:04,090
Bespoke Irish bath bombs of the kind that can only be found in Dublin.

35
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,218
Beautiful, beautiful Dublin.

36
00:02:06,314 --> 00:02:08,290
Little shape of the Blarney stone.

37
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,438
Each one has a tiny piece of the Blarney stone.

38
00:02:11,534 --> 00:02:29,422
So what's your bright spot, Dan, is my bright spot is obviously my, quote, vacation was a little bit longer than usual, and that's because my partner is on mental health leave from school, and school has started.

39
00:02:29,496 --> 00:02:36,490
And rather, for those who don't know, she's an art teacher at a school that shall not be named.

40
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:49,802
So the amount of nonsense that is immediately out the gate, there's only two art teachers, and one of them now has 50 kids in her class.

41
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:55,706
And rather than hire a different art teacher, the administrative staff hired three more admin people.

42
00:02:55,828 --> 00:02:58,634
So I think we know exactly what their focus is.

43
00:02:58,732 --> 00:02:59,298
Admin.

44
00:02:59,394 --> 00:02:59,870
Yeah.

45
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,790
And it ain't teachers.

46
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:14,466
How is this your bright spot? Her mental health during that time period was revelatory, getting away from it all.

47
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,830
I mean, it was a reset for her.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,910
She was better than it was not quite that great.

49
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,606
Okay.

50
00:03:21,788 --> 00:03:28,110
She did not stop climate change, but she slept better than I think I've seen her sleep in a long time.

51
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,814
And not like that.

52
00:03:29,912 --> 00:03:32,638
I slept 12 hours kind of sleep, but that healthy.

53
00:03:32,734 --> 00:03:36,786
I'm waking up on a good time, and I'm happy, and I'm doing a good job.

54
00:03:36,908 --> 00:03:40,770
It was beautiful to watch, and it just filled me with so much joy.

55
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:49,938
So, yeah, that's my bright spot, is that we have left that horrible place where she was happy and come back to Chicago where she can be abused by everybody.

56
00:03:50,084 --> 00:03:53,854
We got Vienna beef right through the garden.

57
00:03:53,902 --> 00:03:54,690
That's what we got.

58
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,310
Give me some of that relish.

59
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,026
They don't have it there.

60
00:03:58,088 --> 00:03:59,274
No, that's true.

61
00:03:59,312 --> 00:03:59,998
They really don't.

62
00:04:00,034 --> 00:04:02,026
There's an embargo on relish.

63
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:02,840
Absolutely.

64
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,730
So, Jordan, today we have an episode to go over.

65
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:05,958
Hell.

66
00:04:05,984 --> 00:04:06,560
Yeah.

67
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:12,994
There's been a lot that's happened since we've recorded a present day episode.

68
00:04:13,042 --> 00:04:13,650
Right.

69
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:19,030
Because you're gone and then the trial stuff was pretty dominant.

70
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:19,530
Yes.

71
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,520
It caused a clog in the pipes, as it were.

72
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:32,334
And I decided that what we should do is focus on the thing that I think most people were talking about, maybe the highest profile piece of information.

73
00:04:32,432 --> 00:04:37,698
And that was that last week on Wednesday, Alex turned on Trump.

74
00:04:37,784 --> 00:04:38,286
Right.

75
00:04:38,408 --> 00:04:40,458
Or one would be led to believe that.

76
00:04:40,484 --> 00:04:41,240
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,700
So this was last Wednesday, not four months ago.

78
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,846
Not a year ago.

79
00:04:48,968 --> 00:04:51,102
No, not a year and four months ago.

80
00:04:51,176 --> 00:04:53,034
No, not a year and eight months ago.

81
00:04:53,072 --> 00:04:56,106
The point is made that Alex turns on Trump a lot.

82
00:04:56,168 --> 00:04:57,882
Seems like he's turned on Trump quite a bit.

83
00:04:57,956 --> 00:04:59,526
I'm surprised it's still news.

84
00:04:59,648 --> 00:05:00,006
Yeah.

85
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:04,422
So we're going to talk about August 17, 2022.

86
00:05:04,496 --> 00:05:06,200
How do you do? Okay.

87
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:16,762
We'll get back to some other present day stuff on Friday, but that seemed like something that has an immediate need.

88
00:05:16,836 --> 00:05:17,950
It needs an address.

89
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,994
Indeed, yes.

90
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:33,214
Now, Jordan, I want to address one thing really quick, and that is that there's a widespread perception that I took a week off because you were good luck out of town, and this is not true.

91
00:05:33,312 --> 00:05:35,554
I would give anything for you to take a week off.

92
00:05:35,592 --> 00:05:37,898
We did not put out any episodes so publicly.

93
00:05:37,934 --> 00:05:41,194
It might have appeared that I took a week off, but I did not.

94
00:05:41,292 --> 00:05:47,510
And I have something very special to announce, and that is that we are doing another round of buttons.

95
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,486
What? Everyone loves a button.

96
00:05:49,548 --> 00:05:50,170
Everybody.

97
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:55,750
And I'm really thrilled with this round.

98
00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:05,890
Our flagship button this time around is made by my dear friend Angela Lampsberry, and she's designed the Squatch Has No Heroes button.

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,418
So everyone who responds will get one of those.

100
00:06:09,504 --> 00:06:09,898
Right.

101
00:06:09,984 --> 00:06:15,086
And then there's a random pick from a series of other buttons.

102
00:06:15,158 --> 00:06:15,574
Yes.

103
00:06:15,672 --> 00:06:19,330
A number of them made by the very talented Lard D'Souza.

104
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:25,740
A number of different buttons themed on Alex things like Grape Job is one of them.

105
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,718
And so those are there.

106
00:06:27,864 --> 00:06:32,834
Also our dear friend Sarah Shockey from Marty and Sarah Love Wrestling.

107
00:06:32,882 --> 00:06:33,310
Absolutely.

108
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:38,086
Among other things, she designed a dreamy, creamy summer button.

109
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:38,722
Oh, man.

110
00:06:38,796 --> 00:06:39,662
And dreamy.

111
00:06:39,686 --> 00:06:40,858
Creamy Summer 2022.

112
00:06:40,884 --> 00:06:41,662
Because I'm going to do this every day.

113
00:06:41,676 --> 00:06:44,842
Well, yeah, obviously, that is our deal.

114
00:06:45,036 --> 00:06:46,860
Next year will be yogurts, though.

115
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,078
I don't think it won't be no, we don't do yogurts.

116
00:06:50,114 --> 00:06:50,758
I'm not going to do that.

117
00:06:50,784 --> 00:06:56,494
I was going to say so we have all these buttons, and there's two important things to bring up.

118
00:06:56,592 --> 00:07:04,418
One is that I have learned over the course of doing these button things that this is the best way to ruin an inbox.

119
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:10,118
So I have needed to create a separate email address for button requests.

120
00:07:10,154 --> 00:07:10,714
Right.

121
00:07:10,872 --> 00:07:13,810
I wanted to get Kfbuttons@gmailcom.

122
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,770
Of course you did.

123
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,490
It's taken.

124
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,520
How? By whom? I don't know.

125
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:25,330
Kingfightersbuttons, what are you talking about? So the email address that you need to write to if you want a button oh, boy.

126
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,970
Is Kfbutton 69 at Gmail.

127
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,706
Oh, man.

128
00:07:31,888 --> 00:07:45,326
That was available? How could it not be? So, if you want a button, just send an email to that with your address, or a shipping address, mailing address, and we will get those turned around.

129
00:07:45,448 --> 00:07:51,654
Ideally, I would like to get those maybe mailed and all done by the end of the dream and creamy summer.

130
00:07:51,702 --> 00:07:52,382
Sure.

131
00:07:52,576 --> 00:07:55,000
As a sort of celebration of the end of it, actually.

132
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:59,330
But I'm not totally committed to that because these things I don't know.

133
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:02,258
I mean, we had way more people want them last time than I could.

134
00:08:02,284 --> 00:08:03,686
God knows what's going to happen now.

135
00:08:03,748 --> 00:08:03,974
Yeah.

136
00:08:04,012 --> 00:08:05,730
This could be absolutely chaos.

137
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,200
I said I wouldn't do this again and then I did it again.

138
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,918
That's what happens when you go out of town.

139
00:08:09,954 --> 00:08:10,720
I know.

140
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,890
You can't not work.

141
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,222
You can't not work.

142
00:08:14,296 --> 00:08:16,998
Now, one more important thing about these buttons.

143
00:08:17,034 --> 00:08:17,342
Yes.

144
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:18,306
This is very exciting.

145
00:08:18,378 --> 00:08:19,082
Okay.

146
00:08:19,276 --> 00:08:24,590
There is a design that is a what's your bright spot design of a button.

147
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,040
It has a little treasure chest on it.

148
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,474
I've made three of these.

149
00:08:29,572 --> 00:08:30,326
Oh, my God.

150
00:08:30,388 --> 00:08:30,738
Damn.

151
00:08:30,774 --> 00:08:32,034
I wanted to make a Willy Wonka.

152
00:08:32,082 --> 00:08:33,218
Willy Wonka ad.

153
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,430
Motherfucker.

154
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,238
There are three golden tickets.

155
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:38,846
Yes.

156
00:08:38,968 --> 00:08:39,640
Okay.

157
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,534
There are only three.

158
00:08:41,692 --> 00:08:43,070
I've only made three.

159
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:47,306
And whoever receives them will also receive an ironic punishment of some sort.

160
00:08:47,428 --> 00:08:48,100
No.

161
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:54,662
If you receive one of those and send us a picture of you with the button yeah.

162
00:08:54,676 --> 00:09:01,862
You don't have to send yourself a picture of your face or whatever, but we will make a donation to a charity of your choice in your name.

163
00:09:01,936 --> 00:09:02,318
Absolutely.

164
00:09:02,404 --> 00:09:05,234
So that's the way we're going to Wonka it's done.

165
00:09:05,272 --> 00:09:06,966
No ironic punishments necessary.

166
00:09:07,038 --> 00:09:10,000
Just something kind of fun, something really cool.

167
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:15,662
I thought it would be silly, but then I also thought we should just do one.

168
00:09:15,796 --> 00:09:17,150
No, we can't just do one.

169
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,594
And the odds of it maybe not getting to the person trying to scare me.

170
00:09:20,632 --> 00:09:20,906
Right.

171
00:09:20,968 --> 00:09:23,154
So three seem like the sweet spot.

172
00:09:23,202 --> 00:09:25,286
Right? Well, at least get two, maybe.

173
00:09:25,348 --> 00:09:26,462
You know what I'm saying? Yeah.

174
00:09:26,536 --> 00:09:30,062
And this isn't true at all, but I'm going to say it in order to scare people.

175
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:30,518
Okay.

176
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:32,980
I can tell a bootleg a mile away.

177
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:37,250
I will be able to tell if you're trying to run a fast one.

178
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,342
Absolutely not.

179
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,514
And they're not be putting up with any of that.

180
00:09:40,552 --> 00:09:42,594
Don't post your button picture publicly.

181
00:09:42,642 --> 00:09:47,270
Otherwise somebody will get the screenshot, image search.

182
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,400
Oh, that's true.

183
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:49,526
Yeah.

184
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:50,714
I don't know what that means.

185
00:09:50,812 --> 00:09:52,242
He was going to say, Sounds convinced.

186
00:09:52,266 --> 00:09:53,500
Well, you both know it.

187
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,382
So Jordan let's get into this episode.

188
00:09:56,406 --> 00:09:58,386
But first, let's say hello to some new wands.

189
00:09:58,458 --> 00:09:59,006
That's great.

190
00:09:59,068 --> 00:10:03,534
Also, because we were out of town and we didn't have the backlog.

191
00:10:03,582 --> 00:10:04,394
Once again.

192
00:10:04,552 --> 00:10:05,440
Oh, boy.

193
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:06,830
Sorry.

194
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,610
Yeah.

195
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:14,274
Anyway, coming from the outer regions of the universe, it's Dantron Zero and Jordan Nader.

196
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:14,870
Check it.

197
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,482
Thank you so much.

198
00:10:15,496 --> 00:10:16,598
You're now a policy walk.

199
00:10:16,684 --> 00:10:17,834
I'm a policy walk.

200
00:10:17,932 --> 00:10:20,930
Dantron Zero and Jordan Nader.

201
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,886
Next, Jordan's physics knowledge is awesome.

202
00:10:26,008 --> 00:10:27,534
Doctor of Physics Lily.

203
00:10:27,582 --> 00:10:28,118
Thank you so much.

204
00:10:28,144 --> 00:10:29,430
You're an I'm a policy wonk.

205
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,642
I'm a policy wonk.

206
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:31,538
Thank you very much.

207
00:10:31,624 --> 00:10:33,938
You know about physics? I know a lot, actually.

208
00:10:34,024 --> 00:10:34,910
It's weird.

209
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,610
So tell me something about physics.

210
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:41,006
Well, an electron is not really a thing.

211
00:10:41,068 --> 00:10:43,782
It's actually kind of a superposition.

212
00:10:43,866 --> 00:10:46,058
So you can never know what an electron is.

213
00:10:46,084 --> 00:10:49,070
And so it's more considered a field at this point in time.

214
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:54,820
Now, if you put it through a particle accelerator, all right, you're going to get all kinds of wild stuff.

215
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,154
I love it when Jordan says bananas.

216
00:10:59,202 --> 00:10:59,798
Thank you so much.

217
00:10:59,824 --> 00:11:00,938
You're now a policy walk.

218
00:11:01,024 --> 00:11:02,118
I'm a policy wonk.

219
00:11:02,154 --> 00:11:02,834
Thank you very much.

220
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:05,258
I feel like that's sarcastic because I say it too much.

221
00:11:05,404 --> 00:11:10,554
No, this person actually explained that they chose the name because they like it when you say banana.

222
00:11:10,602 --> 00:11:11,102
Oh, wow.

223
00:11:11,176 --> 00:11:14,162
I mean, that's a very literal bananas thing to say.

224
00:11:14,236 --> 00:11:14,634
Indeed.

225
00:11:14,682 --> 00:11:15,006
Yay.

226
00:11:15,078 --> 00:11:17,502
So we also got some Technocrats in the mix here, Jordan.

227
00:11:17,526 --> 00:11:18,194
So first.

228
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:18,986
Oh, my God.

229
00:11:19,048 --> 00:11:20,946
Coal has been taken over by the globalists.

230
00:11:21,018 --> 00:11:21,594
Just kidding.

231
00:11:21,642 --> 00:11:22,994
It's as dope as it's ever been.

232
00:11:23,032 --> 00:11:24,040
Thank you so much.

233
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,718
Oh, I get it.

234
00:11:25,744 --> 00:11:26,562
It's not cold.

235
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:27,342
I thought it was cold.

236
00:11:27,366 --> 00:11:28,290
It's cold.

237
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,762
Oh, the open mic.

238
00:11:29,836 --> 00:11:30,362
The bar.

239
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:30,926
The bar.

240
00:11:30,988 --> 00:11:31,250
Yeah.

241
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:31,722
Just kidding.

242
00:11:31,746 --> 00:11:32,738
It's as deep as it's ever been.

243
00:11:32,764 --> 00:11:33,182
Thank you so much.

244
00:11:33,196 --> 00:11:34,458
You are now a technocrat.

245
00:11:34,614 --> 00:11:38,838
Next, the magical, mystical Master Sergeant Daniel Jordan's.

246
00:11:38,874 --> 00:11:44,330
Mystery Conspiratorial time Machine Band Featuring the Doctor Dreamy Creamy.

247
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,358
Featuring the Dreamy Creamy.

248
00:11:47,394 --> 00:11:47,666
Dr.

249
00:11:47,728 --> 00:11:50,598
twoTS and the Amazing Technical Squatch.

250
00:11:50,694 --> 00:11:52,626
Thank you so much, you are now a Technocrat.

251
00:11:52,758 --> 00:11:56,366
And soyboizoo the pretend race team.

252
00:11:56,488 --> 00:11:57,398
Thank you so much.

253
00:11:57,484 --> 00:11:58,758
You're now a Technocrat.

254
00:11:58,854 --> 00:12:00,030
I'm a policy wonk.

255
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:03,366
I have risen above my enemies.

256
00:12:03,498 --> 00:12:04,838
I might quit tomorrow, actually.

257
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:09,940
I'm just going to take a little break now, a little breaky for me.

258
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:16,562
And then we're going to come back and I'm going to start the show over.

259
00:12:16,696 --> 00:12:17,478
I'm the devil.

260
00:12:17,514 --> 00:12:19,060
I got to be taken over here.

261
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:22,850
Fuck you.

262
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:31,218
I got plenty of words for you, but at the end of the day, fuck you in your new world order, and fuck the horse you rode in on and all your shit.

263
00:12:31,374 --> 00:12:33,330
Maybe today's creep on this broadcast.

264
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,980
Maybe I'll just be gone a month, maybe five years.

265
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:40,360
Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow and you never see me again.

266
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,700
That's really what I want to do.

267
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,846
I never want to come back here again.

268
00:12:44,968 --> 00:12:51,520
I apologize to the crew and the listeners yesterday that I was legitimately having breakdowns on air.

269
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,262
I'll be better tomorrow.

270
00:12:53,346 --> 00:12:53,906
He's not.

271
00:12:53,968 --> 00:12:54,806
Oh, no.

272
00:12:54,988 --> 00:13:02,954
So we start off here with Alex being in a mood about deaths in the world.

273
00:13:03,052 --> 00:13:03,422
Sure.

274
00:13:03,496 --> 00:13:04,554
There's a lot of deaths.

275
00:13:04,662 --> 00:13:06,290
Well, yes, recently.

276
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,490
Yeah.

277
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,422
His take on it might be a little off though.

278
00:13:09,436 --> 00:13:12,640
Okay, there's no turning back now.

279
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:16,202
We've chosen which side we're on.

280
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:17,750
Team Freedom.

281
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:44,974
We are now inside the operational phase of global cultural and economic societal collapse and the mass forestry population that has already begun according to all major insurance I'm sorry, what now? Record deaths in every western country that has taken the experimental injections.

282
00:13:45,082 --> 00:13:46,390
Incredible time to be alive.

283
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:52,570
Look, so look, you look, alex, look up the claim that all western countries are seeing record deaths.

284
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:56,226
It's not something that Alex can make in any meaningful way.

285
00:13:56,348 --> 00:13:59,430
The type of statistics you would need to prove that aren't available.

286
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:09,610
And the only thing you could possibly be working off of is like anecdotal stories that his antivax friends are telling him that he sees on social media or that weird Steve guy's substitute.

287
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:27,318
Yeah, I mean, is there a running tally of deaths per twelve month time period that you can compare going back several hundred years perhaps, to the Black Death? You know what I'm saying? Like what is a record number compared to what? Oh, that is a good point.

288
00:14:27,404 --> 00:14:29,250
He says record deaths.

289
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,750
It's not very specific.

290
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,898
Yeah, I don't know.

291
00:14:32,924 --> 00:14:33,798
I don't think he cares as much.

292
00:14:33,824 --> 00:14:34,678
He's just talking shit.

293
00:14:34,714 --> 00:14:35,274
That's a good point.

294
00:14:35,312 --> 00:14:39,538
But Alex is blaming this on the COVID vaccines, which again, is also a lot of shit.

295
00:14:39,694 --> 00:14:43,522
The only place he ever pulls vaccine data from is VAERS.

296
00:14:43,606 --> 00:14:53,780
Because it's a place where all reports of any side effects that anyone experiences after getting vaccinated are reported, regardless of whether or not the vaccine caused the side effect.

297
00:14:54,230 --> 00:15:06,838
Up to August 10, 2022, there had been 606,000,000 doses administered and 15, 930 reports of people dying after getting the vaccine that had been entered into VAERS.

298
00:15:06,994 --> 00:15:10,630
That doesn't mean that almost 16,000 people died because of the vaccine.

299
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:16,150
But even if it did, that represents 00:20 6% of vaccinations.

300
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:22,138
The CDC has identified nine deaths that they can causally link to a vaccine for COVID.

301
00:15:22,234 --> 00:15:24,030
And those aren't even the mRNA ones.

302
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,310
Those are people who got the Johnson and Johnson show.

303
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,290
So none of this makes any sense.

304
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:38,302
This is stupid, but Alex wants to be very extreme about the vaccine, and I got that sense pretty immediately.

305
00:15:38,446 --> 00:15:39,990
And I think that there's a good reason.

306
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,354
I think you'll see as this goes on, why this needs to be heightened.

307
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:43,722
Okay.

308
00:15:43,796 --> 00:15:46,100
And made as severe as possible.

309
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,110
So yeah, we got the midterms coming up.

310
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,180
Oh my God.

311
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,886
Why does he keep talking about the midterms? Because they're very important.

312
00:15:53,948 --> 00:15:54,826
No one cares.

313
00:15:54,898 --> 00:15:57,438
The Republicans, they might want to take over the country.

314
00:15:57,524 --> 00:16:03,306
Sure, Alex might be okay with that, but also maybe they need to take over the country more.

315
00:16:03,368 --> 00:16:04,254
That sounds right.

316
00:16:04,352 --> 00:16:17,454
Republicans running around wedding themselves with excitement that we're about to take over the country even if we get more Senate seats and take the Senate and take the House.

317
00:16:17,612 --> 00:16:20,230
So many Republicans are basically Democrats.

318
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:24,860
Yeah, only that's the big problem.

319
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,642
But the good news is this.

320
00:16:27,836 --> 00:16:40,446
We have leaders like Rhonda Santas and we have leaders like Balsamaro and Victor Orban and others that understand what's going on.

321
00:16:40,568 --> 00:16:43,558
He's been ramping up his name dropping of Orban.

322
00:16:43,714 --> 00:16:46,230
It's been definitely happening more lately.

323
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:47,874
Let me be clear.

324
00:16:47,972 --> 00:16:50,610
We don't have leaders like Bolsonaro and Orban.

325
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:56,430
Just because Orban spoke at CPAC doesn't mean he has any control over the US.

326
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:03,190
I feel like if I was DeSantis, I would be like, please don't put me in without and out fascists.

327
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:12,030
I would like to still slide under the radar for at least a little while before I get to become president and fascist with the shit out of people, ironically get me past the midterm.

328
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,038
Exactly.

329
00:17:13,184 --> 00:17:13,710
Yes.

330
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,694
Then we'll talk.

331
00:17:14,792 --> 00:17:15,440
Yeah.

332
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:26,918
Obviously the big talking point that was circling around social media after this episode was that Alex has turned on Trump in favor of DeSantis.

333
00:17:26,954 --> 00:17:27,334
Sure.

334
00:17:27,432 --> 00:17:36,650
So it's obviously a high praise for him to be put in the same category as or bomb the people destroying the Amazon rainforest.

335
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:47,678
So Alex does still like Trump, and that's something that's important to recognize, despite what the sort of Alex has turned on Trump.

336
00:17:47,764 --> 00:17:49,662
Finally, the discourse.

337
00:17:49,746 --> 00:17:50,380
Yeah.

338
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:54,218
This episode has been now, I'll say this.

339
00:17:54,244 --> 00:18:01,826
I like Donald Trump, and I know the system doesn't like him, and I know I've been persecuted like nothing in my life for supporting him.

340
00:18:01,888 --> 00:18:02,150
Sure.

341
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:15,974
That made me kind of pig headedly support him a few years ago, even though I disagree with his warp speed, because I thought that we had to keep him in office because of the nightmare scenario if Hillary or Biden got in.

342
00:18:16,072 --> 00:18:24,738
So if this is true and Alex supported Trump when Operation Warp Speed was happening because of need to keep Trump in office, then he was lying to his audience.

343
00:18:24,894 --> 00:18:29,874
Alex was super clear that he had, like, these really high level back channel intelligence sources.

344
00:18:29,922 --> 00:18:36,462
They were telling him that Trump was supporting the vaccine to set a track for the globalists and so he could force their hand to reopen the economy.

345
00:18:36,606 --> 00:18:46,566
Alex has also said that Trump got tricked into supporting the vaccine development, but he's never said that it was a purely partisan political consideration on his own part to excuse that behavior.

346
00:18:46,638 --> 00:18:48,194
Yeah, that's fucked up.

347
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:48,662
Yeah.

348
00:18:48,736 --> 00:18:54,302
Also, covet happened after Hillary had lost the 2016 election, so I have no idea what she's coming up here.

349
00:18:54,436 --> 00:19:09,062
It's pretty insane to think that Alex could have acted the way he did and excused all the shit that he's completely philosophically against just because of a desire to keep Trump in office, who, I should remind you, is the person who is doing all the stuff Alex is philosophically against.

350
00:19:09,256 --> 00:19:11,358
He supported vaccines and boosters.

351
00:19:11,454 --> 00:19:14,126
He didn't get Alex and the weirdos back on social media.

352
00:19:14,188 --> 00:19:15,426
He didn't lock up Hillary.

353
00:19:15,498 --> 00:19:17,826
He didn't build a wall and kick out all the immigrants.

354
00:19:17,898 --> 00:19:19,686
He didn't free Julian Assange.

355
00:19:19,818 --> 00:19:23,058
All of this stuff should be fundamentally disqualifying for Alex.

356
00:19:23,094 --> 00:19:27,606
And yet he turned a blind eye because he didn't want a Democrat to win the presidency.

357
00:19:27,738 --> 00:19:28,730
That's weird.

358
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:35,286
And this obviously doesn't apply to him.

359
00:19:35,348 --> 00:19:38,014
Obviously, Alex this does not apply to Alex.

360
00:19:38,062 --> 00:19:54,630
But for me personally, I would feel shame if I was telling you that, by the way, when I said all of that stuff, I was betraying all of my principles for no reason other than that people made me feel like I should because I oppose them.

361
00:19:54,680 --> 00:20:00,982
And I was coming up with elaborate stories to pretend that I wasn't giving up on my principles.

362
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:10,014
By rationalizing giving up on my principles for several years, I have learned that I was rationalizing giving up my principles for several years.

363
00:20:10,052 --> 00:20:10,930
You motherfuckers.

364
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:15,210
I made up so many Lieutenant Colonels these last five years.

365
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:15,654
Oh, man.

366
00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:23,682
There are so many people who are fighting against the deep state, who let me know that it was okay for me to betray all my what? Great.

367
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:26,194
What? I don't want to sound too mean, but this is pathetic.

368
00:20:26,302 --> 00:20:34,710
Alex rejected the opportunity to stand up for all of his principles because he saw a possibility that someone who he kind of knew might be able to hang on to power.

369
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,874
This isn't the sort of thing a person like who Alex pretends to be would do.

370
00:20:38,912 --> 00:20:40,422
It's what a coward does.

371
00:20:40,556 --> 00:20:42,546
And guess what? It didn't matter.

372
00:20:42,668 --> 00:20:45,882
Biden still won the 2020 election, and here we are.

373
00:20:46,016 --> 00:20:52,230
Alex sold himself out for a presidential election, something his past self would never let him get away with.

374
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,714
And what has he got to show for it? Nothing.

375
00:20:54,812 --> 00:20:55,962
Basically nothing.

376
00:20:56,156 --> 00:21:07,146
It is funny to go back and think about all of those positive comments from Glenn Greenwald and Matt Taibbi about how he was ahead of his time and he's sticking to his guns, and that's why people didn't like him.

377
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:11,610
It was because he refused to be a part of the two party system.

378
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:18,260
And then to hear him say, you know, I'm thoroughly a part of the two party system.

379
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:19,462
Sad.

380
00:21:19,606 --> 00:21:20,314
Quite sad.

381
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:20,826
Yeah.

382
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:23,394
Almost as sad as we're recording this.

383
00:21:23,432 --> 00:21:27,022
I'm seeing on Twitter that it looks like Laura Loomer might win her primary.

384
00:21:27,106 --> 00:21:28,040
Hell yeah.

385
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:31,066
It's a heavily GOP district.

386
00:21:31,198 --> 00:21:32,922
She's probably going to be in.

387
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,100
She's in.

388
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,610
Put her right next to MTG.

389
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:37,614
Oh, my God.

390
00:21:37,712 --> 00:21:42,526
I think they should put them in a Pope mobile in Congress.

391
00:21:42,598 --> 00:21:48,800
They should be put behind glass so everybody can sometimes turn and look at them and go, oh, look at that.

392
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,370
We have pets.

393
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,454
Oh, my God, she's going to be great.

394
00:21:53,492 --> 00:21:57,478
She's going to handcuff herself to one door of Congress.

395
00:21:57,574 --> 00:21:58,220
Beautiful.

396
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:01,494
More dumbness, please.

397
00:22:01,592 --> 00:22:02,262
Oh, my God.

398
00:22:02,336 --> 00:22:03,462
I can't handle this.

399
00:22:03,596 --> 00:22:08,562
Anyway, Alex likes DeSantis now because he's getting pilled as hell, sure.

400
00:22:08,696 --> 00:22:11,850
But that said, I am supporting the Santa.

401
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:20,520
DeSantis is just gone from being awesome to being unbelievably good.

402
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:24,790
And I don't just watch a man's actions, as Christ said, just a tree by his fruits.

403
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:39,840
I can also look in his eyes on HD video and I see the real sincerity of a father and a husband who loves his children in this country and that he's getting red pilled more and more each day.

404
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:43,522
And then he's white pilled about the future and we stand up.

405
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:48,518
I'm sorry, what if we don't? Yeah, that white pill, black pill thing is convoluted.

406
00:22:48,614 --> 00:22:53,822
If you believe that there is a chance you can do something to alter the future, then you can't be blackpilled.

407
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:56,246
This is just Alex wanting to throw around pill language.

408
00:22:56,318 --> 00:22:58,894
Willynilly pilly nilly, if you will.

409
00:22:58,992 --> 00:22:59,582
I won't.

410
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:00,370
All right, fine.

411
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:00,742
Yeah.

412
00:23:00,816 --> 00:23:08,834
I think Alex may have some problems with DeSantis that he doesn't expect to come up because he doesn't really know much about him except for the shit he talks.

413
00:23:08,882 --> 00:23:15,754
Right? Like the Santa does talk a fair amount of shit, sure, but I think some of the positions that he holds could end up being a problem for Alex, too.

414
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:20,230
It's fun, though, that he has a shiny new aspiring fascist to cheerlead for.

415
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:27,026
But that light is only going to dim over time as DeSantis fails to live up to Alex's comically extremist expectations.

416
00:23:27,218 --> 00:23:29,162
But also, this is just a bummer.

417
00:23:29,306 --> 00:23:31,270
Alex can just support no one.

418
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:38,678
That's what he's supposed to be, the guy who isn't backing any individual because he's too busy rooting out corruption on both sides of the aisle.

419
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:45,818
Having a candidate you're supporting kind of makes your whole Watchdog thing seem a little false, and it's really a repudiation of his entire character.

420
00:23:45,914 --> 00:23:49,658
And I put Ron Paul on the side because he was a perennial loser.

421
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:51,780
Ron Paul, he's never going to win.

422
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:57,300
Even if he did win, his function is to destroy the thing he was elected into.

423
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:59,040
It's different.

424
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:05,438
If I were Alex, I would have gone back to Rand Paul or I would have just abandoned Trump without choosing a new hero.

425
00:24:05,534 --> 00:24:20,498
I have a strong sense of why Alex is doing the thing this way, and we'll get into this over the course of the episode, but it's just so sad to see him go from a guy who's like, I'm above it all to being like, I'm going to hedge my bets with a different GOP candidate.

426
00:24:20,654 --> 00:24:23,640
Here's my big problem with all of this.

427
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:27,734
All of it, which is, one, he's supporting DeSantis.

428
00:24:27,782 --> 00:24:32,210
For what? President? No, for the governor of Florida.

429
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,962
He's already the governor of Florida.

430
00:24:33,986 --> 00:24:35,222
He's got to be reelected.

431
00:24:35,366 --> 00:24:36,142
Fine.

432
00:24:36,336 --> 00:24:38,266
He has not announced he's running for president.

433
00:24:38,388 --> 00:24:39,862
He's not going to win.

434
00:24:39,996 --> 00:24:40,750
Oh, my God.

435
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,014
But even then okay, so he's supporting DeSantis now.

436
00:24:44,112 --> 00:24:45,742
That doesn't mean anything now.

437
00:24:45,756 --> 00:24:48,626
He's supporting him for president in the 2024 election.

438
00:24:48,698 --> 00:24:57,900
But 2022, who gives a fuck who you're supporting now, right? Especially if that person is not it's not even officially running for anything, and neither is Trump.

439
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:15,754
Why are we talking about the 2024 president of that presidential election? The world is burning now because I think that there's a dynamic going on that Alex got bit by the presidential election bug in 2015 and you just can't get enough.

440
00:25:15,852 --> 00:25:16,402
Sure.

441
00:25:16,536 --> 00:25:26,686
I think that it's been so successful for him in terms of marketing, audience attracting, all kinds of things.

442
00:25:26,748 --> 00:25:28,680
People get really caught up in it.

443
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:44,918
There's a sportsy element to it very much, and I think he didn't tap into that much for his entire career because as much as you can cheerlead for Ron Paul during the early parts of the GOP primary where he's involved, that kind of dies down and then you just got to talk shit about all the candidates.

444
00:25:44,954 --> 00:25:45,720
Yeah, exactly.

445
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,846
Great hooray.

446
00:25:47,978 --> 00:25:57,834
But now, in the same way that people started talking about the midterms after the general election, alex is just jumping the gun.

447
00:25:57,942 --> 00:26:00,882
He's over eager for the general election.

448
00:26:00,966 --> 00:26:02,846
I mean, here's the problem, though.

449
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:04,166
I don't care.

450
00:26:04,288 --> 00:26:17,918
And I feel like if you're one of the people who wrote that an infinite number of Alex Jones finally turned on Trump stories, if you're talking about that, then you're talking about the 2024 election, of which there's no reason to speak of.

451
00:26:18,004 --> 00:26:19,430
Yeah, it's silly.

452
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:29,970
I wish I had some names, but I did see a couple of articles that did a good job of pointing out, maybe not in the lead of the story, but in the body of the article.

453
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:34,754
He has done this a bunch of times when he has been seeking attention or publicity stuff.

454
00:26:34,912 --> 00:26:35,860
That's nice.

455
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:48,030
There have been people, some people who have called out that Alex does this a bit, but that definitely was not the prevailing attitude on social media and a number of other media places.

456
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:55,998
But even then, if you pointed out in the body of the article and the headline is still there, you're using his bullshit for your clicks.

457
00:26:56,094 --> 00:26:57,098
That's what it is.

458
00:26:57,184 --> 00:27:02,202
So regardless of how well a job you do in your writing, the headline is bullshit.

459
00:27:02,226 --> 00:27:06,198
It's a tough line to draw, tough balance, and maybe some people didn't.

460
00:27:06,354 --> 00:27:07,314
Some people whisked.

461
00:27:07,362 --> 00:27:08,390
Yeah, I don't know.

462
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:14,822
But look, this is not what it appears to be.

463
00:27:14,896 --> 00:27:18,066
This is not a throwing out Trump and bringing in DeSantis.

464
00:27:18,078 --> 00:27:18,398
Sure.

465
00:27:18,484 --> 00:27:22,070
And that is the perception that you would get if you didn't pay much attention.

466
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:35,680
He has basic self preservation instincts and I'm a DeSantis guy, and if we can use the Santa's leadership to get Trump back on the straight and narrow, that's all the better.

467
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:42,150
But Trump will not talk about his poison vaccines anymore.

468
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,322
That's a plus.

469
00:27:43,516 --> 00:27:46,790
He still says he won't say the V word, but he's still proud of it.

470
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:53,274
So yeah, he just is really interested in getting Trump away from the vaccines.

471
00:27:53,322 --> 00:27:53,678
Right.

472
00:27:53,764 --> 00:28:01,994
This is a solid thrust that Alex is pushing, and he was like, hey, you even have a scapegoat here, man.

473
00:28:02,152 --> 00:28:16,970
Just by fauche that's all Trump needs to do is say, I was lied to by Burke and Fauche, and they were holding the country hostage, and I thought it was a regular vaccine, and it turns out they shouldn't be pushing it on children.

474
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,674
They shouldn't be making people take it.

475
00:28:18,772 --> 00:28:29,834
He's already saying that, but he has to come out all the way and say, I was lied to and decouple his pig headed butt that I still love.

476
00:28:29,992 --> 00:28:30,734
He's real.

477
00:28:30,832 --> 00:28:32,562
What? He's just pinheaded.

478
00:28:32,706 --> 00:28:38,090
So you said earlier when he's fighting for us, it's not when he won't admit he's wrong.

479
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,846
Balsamaro apologized.

480
00:28:40,038 --> 00:28:42,206
What? And said it was bad from the start.

481
00:28:42,268 --> 00:28:44,198
I shouldn't have halfway supported it, though.

482
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:46,010
I was never for forced injection.

483
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:53,260
And now the Santa has come out in a bunch of speeches and said, this is bad news.

484
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:59,054
That's all we want so we can stop poisoning the newborn babies and the six month olds and everybody.

485
00:28:59,152 --> 00:29:05,246
And they got public schools all over blue cities and blue states trying to make the injections mandatory to go to school.

486
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:06,146
Damn it.

487
00:29:06,268 --> 00:29:15,482
So I think he's editorializing a little bit on Bolsonaro's comments, but he apologized after he went to the hospital the fifth time.

488
00:29:15,556 --> 00:29:20,894
Yeah, the one that he's got his head up his ass.

489
00:29:20,932 --> 00:29:26,298
I think he had an impacted bowel for a while, and then they removed it, and then he was anti vaccine.

490
00:29:26,394 --> 00:29:27,578
I think that's how it went.

491
00:29:27,664 --> 00:29:35,850
So Trump is pig headed and what have you, but Alex but Alex said earlier that he supported Trump because he was being pig headed.

492
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,670
It's an interesting point.

493
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,102
Shouldn't that make him support Trump further? Nah.

494
00:29:42,186 --> 00:29:42,854
Okay, fair enough.

495
00:29:42,892 --> 00:29:45,206
Supports DeSantis, but also still supports Trump.

496
00:29:45,268 --> 00:29:45,494
Right.

497
00:29:45,532 --> 00:29:54,150
And Trump is big headed, but if he's big headed in the right direction, then everything would be fine, right? Alex is saying, I'm a big baby.

498
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,014
Wah wah wah.

499
00:29:55,062 --> 00:29:56,380
Please listen to me.

500
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,286
He's just begging Trump.

501
00:29:58,348 --> 00:29:58,862
Yeah.

502
00:29:58,996 --> 00:30:03,280
So I choose children over Trump, and I'm going to say it.

503
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:10,490
I'm not going to get sucked into politics and just support Trump because I hate the Democrats.

504
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:35,394
If Trump doesn't come out against these shots and if he doesn't stand with the children, if he doesn't go in the offense to admit there's major problems, then I'm really caught between a rock and a hard place, because I don't want Kamala Harris or Michael Obama or any of those people.

505
00:30:35,552 --> 00:30:44,694
I know you don't, but I cannot support Trump when the evidence is out that it's killing all these people and maaming others if he continues to do this.

506
00:30:44,732 --> 00:30:47,194
And I think we should open the phones up today on this subject.

507
00:30:47,302 --> 00:30:48,382
So, yeah, here's what's.

508
00:30:48,406 --> 00:30:55,366
Going on as we're getting experienced throughout the course of this episode, alex is torn between supporting Trump and DeSantis.

509
00:30:55,498 --> 00:30:57,402
There are pros and cons with both.

510
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:07,462
With DeSantis, he's got a lot of policy positions that the audience wants to hear, and most importantly, he's been a strong opponent of vaccines, or at least that's the way he has allowed himself to be portrayed.

511
00:31:07,606 --> 00:31:12,558
On the flip side, DeSantis is not going to give Alex the opportunity to pretend to be his friend.

512
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:16,330
He's an actual politician who knows better than to make that kind of an association.

513
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,998
It's going to be crippling in the long term.

514
00:31:18,034 --> 00:31:19,100
He's too young.

515
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:20,514
He has a career ahead.

516
00:31:20,552 --> 00:31:21,378
We get a future.

517
00:31:21,524 --> 00:31:30,010
Conversely, Trump is fine letting weirdos into the inner circle, and Alex has the best shot of staying relevant with Trump are plus Alex's buddies with Roger Stone.

518
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:33,246
So the connection with Trump there is pretty important, I think.

519
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:36,430
They probably not talk anymore, right? Alex flipped.

520
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:44,386
Well, it's more likely for Alex to get some sort of pardon or whatever should that need arise from Trump as opposed to DeSantis.

521
00:31:44,458 --> 00:31:45,654
That is true.

522
00:31:45,812 --> 00:31:50,058
I don't know what things Alex could be pardoned for by Trump.

523
00:31:50,144 --> 00:31:54,440
I mean, at this point, you want a preemptive pardon from the President for whatever.

524
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:57,978
There's a good chance you're committing a crime just by being around it.

525
00:31:58,004 --> 00:31:58,758
Just in case.

526
00:31:58,844 --> 00:31:59,718
Yeah, absolutely.

527
00:31:59,864 --> 00:32:02,554
The problem is that Trump supports vaccines.

528
00:32:02,722 --> 00:32:09,330
This is a big deal because Alex's audience is aggressively antivaxx, and they don't like Trump as much anymore because of it.

529
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:14,002
But this ceases to be a problem if Alex can just convince Trump to become antivaxx.

530
00:32:14,146 --> 00:32:18,462
That will be a much easier fix than trying to get to Santa to be an infowars guy.

531
00:32:18,596 --> 00:32:21,174
And I think that's what this whole pageant has been about.

532
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:26,494
Over the course of this episode and then this video that Alex puts out later, there were two goals.

533
00:32:26,602 --> 00:32:32,962
He's trying to threaten Trump like he did with Rogen, into contempt vaccines by saying that he's going to be like a pig.

534
00:32:33,046 --> 00:32:34,030
You got sneaky snake.

535
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:34,602
Yeah.

536
00:32:34,736 --> 00:32:40,302
And he's trying to score as much free publicity as possible from rubes who feel like they're actually dunking on him.

537
00:32:40,436 --> 00:32:44,134
Third, there's probably an element here that he's soft pitching to the audience.

538
00:32:44,182 --> 00:32:53,682
The actual idea of becoming into DeSantis fully sure, because I think you want to see how the audience responds that you heard him say, we're going to take some calls, put the feelers out there.

539
00:32:53,756 --> 00:32:54,030
Right.

540
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:59,598
And also, you've got plenty of time for the election that is several years away.

541
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:01,266
Yes, you certainly do.

542
00:33:01,328 --> 00:33:02,454
Yeah, you got plenty of time.

543
00:33:02,492 --> 00:33:03,750
Let's put that in the news.

544
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:09,800
Alex changes his support for candidate who is not yet running for president to another guy who's not yet running for president.

545
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:26,850
Another thing I want to point out here is that Ron Flipkowski, this Twitter account, posted a 42nd clip of Alex saying that he was supporting DeSantis, which, as I was preparing this episode, had over 2500 retweets and had been watched by almost 9000 people.

546
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:38,590
This clip is inaccurate, and it's actually manipulatively edited in order to present an image that Ron wants to convey, as opposed to what's actually being said by Alex in this episode.

547
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:45,786
His clip entirely omits the part where Alex is clearly saying that if Trump would just stop that shit with the vaccines and there wouldn't be a problem.

548
00:33:45,908 --> 00:33:49,194
And I think that that's a major component of what Alex is saying here.

549
00:33:49,352 --> 00:33:55,066
It would be one thing if this was actually a straight up episode where Alex was like, I'm done with Trump, let's just go with DeSantis.

550
00:33:55,138 --> 00:33:57,174
But that's not what's going on here.

551
00:33:57,272 --> 00:34:02,226
If you posted an abbreviated clip of that and it captured what Alex was saying, fine.

552
00:34:02,288 --> 00:34:07,938
If he said I was going to shove DeSantis up his dirty asshole, that's a whole different story.

553
00:34:08,024 --> 00:34:08,310
Sure.

554
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,914
Yeah, because he's never done something like that before.

555
00:34:11,012 --> 00:34:11,742
No.

556
00:34:11,936 --> 00:34:29,446
Accounts like this farm attention and social media cloud by posting things that their audience wants to hear, this Ron Fella knows that there's a pretty solidly Democratic voter base that follow him, and it would give them a sense of shodding Freud to hear that Trump had lost his most zealous and rabid supporter.

557
00:34:29,518 --> 00:34:33,020
And so this is the clip that's provided, and it pays off really well.

558
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:39,178
Actually conveying what Alex was saying wouldn't be as emotionally appealing to the people who he's hoping will retreat.

559
00:34:39,214 --> 00:34:40,906
This because it's complicated.

560
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:44,394
And as much as it pains me to say this, it makes sense.

561
00:34:44,552 --> 00:34:52,210
Alex has actually pretended to turn on Trump in far more extreme ways in the past, and this isn't even really an active abandonment.

562
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:55,522
It's very clear that this serves two possible purposes.

563
00:34:55,666 --> 00:35:04,950
Get Trump to be antivaxxed so the ship can be steady, or create a paper trail that Alex can use as a rationale to fully detach from Trump later when he needs to.

564
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:12,406
Like, I gave him a shot, right? What do you want me to do? I feel like the story that I'm missing from all of these people is shame.

565
00:35:12,478 --> 00:35:23,214
I would like more shame for how many times I've seen Ron Philipkowski embedded in a fucking Guardian article or in the Rolling Stone or whomever is embedding him.

566
00:35:23,312 --> 00:35:35,374
Feel shame? Why doesn't anybody feel shame anymore? Dan I kind of understand the reason why I think that a lot of these outlets don't have the time to get their own clips.

567
00:35:35,422 --> 00:35:36,726
Hey, you know what? Clips are there.

568
00:35:36,788 --> 00:35:39,442
I feel like that is a legitimate excuse.

569
00:35:39,586 --> 00:35:46,590
If you don't have time to do a good job, do a shitty job, and then act like it's fine because you don't have time, you make a fair point.

570
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,034
Yeah.

571
00:35:47,132 --> 00:35:52,700
I really resent people who act like this Twitter account, too, because it's essentially doing the same thing that Alex does.

572
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:58,822
If you just say Alex chose to Santos over trump or make implications that the rats are leaving a sinking ship.

573
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:01,582
That's essentially the equivalent of Alex skimming a headline.

574
00:36:01,666 --> 00:36:09,858
And then each party here just makes the narrative up that they want to attach to the headline based on what they want the headline to mean.

575
00:36:09,944 --> 00:36:19,942
Right, but then you're saying that the people who embed him are doing the exact same thing Alex does by skimming that headline from Ron phelpkowski less knowingly, perhaps.

576
00:36:20,026 --> 00:36:20,418
Maybe.

577
00:36:20,504 --> 00:36:26,154
But that's still I don't want to belabor the point, but there's a reason I'm stressing this.

578
00:36:26,192 --> 00:36:28,280
Yeah, we're going to get to it here.

579
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:40,462
So a little bit after this episode, a couple of days later, alex put out a video that's supposed to be an emergency message to Trump explaining that he was just trying to get his attention and get him to ditch the vaccines.

580
00:36:40,606 --> 00:36:52,594
This is completely in line with the message that Alex was putting out on his show on Wednesday, but it is not in line with the narrative that Ron was selling on Twitter in the video that almost a million people watched.

581
00:36:52,762 --> 00:37:02,158
And so when Alex puts out his emergency message, this video is kind of an opportunity for Ron to incorporate it with the narrative that he's constructed.

582
00:37:02,314 --> 00:37:12,390
He posted a 35 2nd clip from the video with this text, quote, getting some blowback after he announced Thursday it was Wednesday that he was backing to Santa's over Trump.

583
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:20,600
Now, Alex Jones issued an emergency message to Trump saying he was simply trying to persuade him to change his position on the vaccines with some tough love.

584
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:30,714
It very well may be that Alex got some blowback from the audience, but I'd be surprised if it was very severe or if it would even matter at all in changing Alex's mind.

585
00:37:30,872 --> 00:37:41,062
If you gauge the temperature of his audience from user comments on his website and callers, they aren't really that opposed to moving past Trump, and DeSantis is a really appealing option for the extreme right wing.

586
00:37:41,206 --> 00:37:49,690
Making that Pivot would likely only cost Alex's proximity to power, and probably a couple of guests might stop coming on and Roger that might get iffy.

587
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:56,602
So, I don't know how that would play out, but I don't know if that's a bridge that Alex can't afford to burn.

588
00:37:56,746 --> 00:37:59,050
Rogers already on Mike Lindell's network.

589
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:18,258
It's not like they're intimately entwined anymore, right? It's just one of those things where, why are we doing this? It feels like everybody is making poor choices simultaneously in defiance of the very obvious.

590
00:38:18,344 --> 00:38:19,234
Good choice.

591
00:38:19,402 --> 00:38:20,326
It's terrible.

592
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:28,102
Well, I think that a lot of people don't realize the game that's being played, right? They don't realize that they're playing with a shady character.

593
00:38:28,186 --> 00:38:36,630
Also, it makes sense for the people not to give a shit if he abandons Trump because we've already done cuckoo bananas in the White House.

594
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:44,850
Now, I'm sure that at least more than enough people are like, what if we tried somebody with a basic level of competence.

595
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:51,330
Also, Alex knows that there's not really that much of a consequence for saying you're turning on Trump because he's done it.

596
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,434
He's done it a ton of times.

597
00:38:52,472 --> 00:38:52,638
Yeah.

598
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:54,930
The consequences, he gets more attention.

599
00:38:55,550 --> 00:39:05,658
But the larger picture here is that that tweet is acting like what Alex is saying in that emergency video that he put out a couple of days later is incongruent with the message that he was putting out on his show.

600
00:39:05,744 --> 00:39:07,002
And that's not true.

601
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,382
And this is a huge problem.

602
00:39:08,456 --> 00:39:13,678
And in order to explain why, I need to play the 32nd section of Alex's video that Ron posted.

603
00:39:13,714 --> 00:39:15,560
This is from that emergency message.

604
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:18,690
So this is my emergency message to you, Mr.

605
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:23,238
President, to go and actually watch the first 30 minutes of Thursday's show.

606
00:39:23,324 --> 00:39:25,830
We'll put a link below here.

607
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:34,230
See what I said in context? The corporate media edited down a 32nd clip to make it sound like that I'm only for DeSanis and that I've abandoned you.

608
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,586
That's not true.

609
00:39:35,768 --> 00:39:37,230
It's the contrary.

610
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,282
I understand you're under attack.

611
00:39:39,356 --> 00:39:45,200
I understand you are surrounded and I'm trying to get you to reassess the situation.

612
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,850
What Alex is saying is true.

613
00:39:48,020 --> 00:40:03,402
If people got the impression that Alex was abandoning Trump and they took him up on that challenge of listening to the 30 minutes, the first 30 minutes of this show from Wednesday, they would come away from that with the conclusion that the clip they were shown on Twitter actually was out of context and it didn't capture what Alex is saying.

614
00:40:03,536 --> 00:40:08,778
The only real problem I have with what Alex is saying there is that Ron flipkowski is not the corporate media.

615
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:09,330
Right.

616
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:16,074
The danger in this is that Alex always says that he's being taken out of context and he basically never is.

617
00:40:16,232 --> 00:40:28,810
Ron actually is taking Alex out of context and he's running a very serious risk of giving people the reason to increase their level of trust in Alex and decrease their trust in critical voices of the extreme.

618
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:29,562
Right.

619
00:40:29,756 --> 00:40:31,638
He is being taken out of context here.

620
00:40:31,664 --> 00:40:39,162
So who's to say if he's actually being taken in context about all that Sandy Hook stuff? Hey, let's do a bad job.

621
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:41,166
We don't have time for a good job.

622
00:40:41,228 --> 00:40:41,838
Come on.

623
00:40:41,924 --> 00:40:52,570
By playing Alex's game, you've exposed people to Alex in a way that if they look into these clips any deeper, they'll come away with the conclusion that Alex is right and that Ron took them out of context.

624
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,702
And this isn't a small deal either.

625
00:40:54,836 --> 00:40:59,418
These videos get hundreds of thousands of views on Twitter and spread all over the place.

626
00:40:59,504 --> 00:41:03,838
As you've already mentioned, many news outlets don't have the resources to hunt down these video clips.

627
00:41:03,874 --> 00:41:06,834
So you'll often see them repost clips from his account.

628
00:41:06,932 --> 00:41:10,366
And by proxy, they are taking Alex out of contest.

629
00:41:10,558 --> 00:41:11,566
It's dangerous.

630
00:41:11,638 --> 00:41:25,386
And more of note, it's a pretty predictable system you could game if you wanted to so if you're Alex now, there's a second thing I need to point out, and that this is a short clip Ron is taking from this emergency video.

631
00:41:25,508 --> 00:41:30,066
It's approximately five minutes into the video that Alex put out.

632
00:41:30,248 --> 00:41:39,670
The video does involve Alex restating that he's trying to play hardball to get Trump to go anti vex, basically pulling the I'm really leaving this time threat.

633
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,420
That's totally that's fair.

634
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:44,034
But that's not what the video is about.

635
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:50,298
The first five full minutes are a breakdown of Alex's main COVID vaccine talking points.

636
00:41:50,444 --> 00:41:56,262
Basically, he's distilling it down to, like he's pretending to have a briefing for Trump giving talking points.

637
00:41:56,336 --> 00:41:56,970
Right.

638
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:03,262
What? The first five minutes of this nine minute video is where the last two minutes are a fucking commercial.

639
00:42:03,406 --> 00:42:13,122
So the more important thing, like what that video actually is, is Alex clarifying and providing the talking points.

640
00:42:13,256 --> 00:42:25,306
Should Trump watch that video? Why are we even posting it anyways if it's theoretically a message to someone who will never in a million years watch it? Two reasons.

641
00:42:25,378 --> 00:42:32,430
One, to capitalize on the media attention that he got out of trending for supposedly turning on Trump, of course.

642
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:40,974
And second, Alex in that video claims that some people that he knows, who know Trump were like, hey, man, what's the fucking deal? Sure.

643
00:42:41,132 --> 00:42:42,030
I don't believe that.

644
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:46,086
Okay, giuliani emailed him like, hey, man, what are you doing? Right? Yeah.

645
00:42:46,148 --> 00:42:54,634
So framing this video as being Alex backpedaling only serves to strengthen the original, out of context framing that was crafted by Ron's original tweet.

646
00:42:54,742 --> 00:43:02,742
In essence, he's putting out information that just lives in a false reality that he's designed for his audience, whether intentionally or not.

647
00:43:02,876 --> 00:43:07,182
It's one that he probably thinks is benign, like this reality and information.

648
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:16,726
But it's a bad idea even if you accept that this series of poorly contextualized clips are being put out as the result of an honest, innocent mistake.

649
00:43:16,798 --> 00:43:17,070
Sure.

650
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:21,138
The information model that's being used for this Twitter account is not good.

651
00:43:21,284 --> 00:43:33,450
It's one that plays directly into the games that the people he's covering use, and they have a responsibility to do better because there is a massive audience that is viewing this content.

652
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:38,780
And as you pointed out, it's something that's being used as a resource for larger media.

653
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:46,494
And I don't know, I have a really tough time with it because I see this stuff come up all the time.

654
00:43:46,532 --> 00:43:50,614
I see these clips all the time from his account being everywhere.

655
00:43:50,662 --> 00:43:51,198
Yeah.

656
00:43:51,344 --> 00:43:57,454
And I don't know enough about a number of the things to know if these are out of context.

657
00:43:57,502 --> 00:43:57,966
Sure.

658
00:43:58,088 --> 00:44:03,198
But I know enough about Alex that I can see these, and I can say that's not fair.

659
00:44:03,284 --> 00:44:06,210
Right? Alex sucks, but that's not fair.

660
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:23,866
It should be required for everyone who post anything about Alex Jones to listen to the first how not to Cover Alex Jones episode, because over time, we've done several hundred how not to cover Alex Jones episodes, and I feel like we're back in the same spot.

661
00:44:23,938 --> 00:44:30,418
Yeah, unforced errors are made a bunch and yeah, it's unfortunate.

662
00:44:30,454 --> 00:44:38,730
I think it's because people think that they're dealing with something that is not as dangerous as it is.

663
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,146
You know what I mean? Right.

664
00:44:40,268 --> 00:44:46,194
I think that there is a blase nature that is taken towards coverage of this.

665
00:44:46,292 --> 00:44:50,058
Like, haha, you lost your cheerleader guy.

666
00:44:50,144 --> 00:44:50,754
Ha ha.

667
00:44:50,852 --> 00:44:56,898
And I can understand how it's emotionally gratifying to do that.

668
00:44:56,984 --> 00:44:57,342
Right.

669
00:44:57,416 --> 00:45:03,642
No, we're never going to defeat the dopamine rush of feeling good for 2 seconds and then going back to your day.

670
00:45:03,716 --> 00:45:04,206
You bet.

671
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:05,010
Yeah, you bet.

672
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:11,814
But the flip side of it is that let's say there's a million people who watch this video.

673
00:45:11,972 --> 00:45:19,522
Let's say, I don't know, 1% go look into it and see that Alex was taken out of context.

674
00:45:19,606 --> 00:45:27,274
Maybe like this alex actually all about how many people have you misled down a terrible path.

675
00:45:27,442 --> 00:45:34,390
And even though they're 99% who don't look into anything you have just given useless information to that isn't accurate.

676
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:38,710
Yeah, one of my favorite things it's a waste.

677
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:39,390
Yeah.

678
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:51,078
One of my favorite things about the media, whatever that may be, the corporate blah, blah, blah, is that after Trump was elected, they took stock of themselves.

679
00:45:51,224 --> 00:46:03,954
They realized that they too played a part in destroying the America that we used to know and electing Trump, and then they changed their model to wait, did they do that? I think maybe a few yes.

680
00:46:03,992 --> 00:46:04,342
Folks.

681
00:46:04,426 --> 00:46:05,060
Great.

682
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:13,930
So anyway, I just think that maybe just that account should do better.

683
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:18,830
Anyway, look, Trump has made some improvement.

684
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:20,326
On what? I don't know.

685
00:46:20,388 --> 00:46:23,770
Okay, he's already turned the ship around about 80 degrees.

686
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:35,886
the opposite direction.

687
00:46:36,078 --> 00:46:37,850
He's only turned part way away.

688
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,098
Okay, fine.

689
00:46:39,184 --> 00:46:41,354
He's only turned part way around.

690
00:46:41,452 --> 00:46:50,082
We need a full turning around and going the opposite direction because I will not be part of the poisoning of these six month old babies.

691
00:46:50,226 --> 00:46:51,160
Damn it.

692
00:46:51,490 --> 00:46:52,154
Damn it.

693
00:46:52,192 --> 00:46:54,342
I don't mean that as taking a Lord's name in vain.

694
00:46:54,486 --> 00:46:58,958
Damn these people to hell, including Trump, if he doesn't stop it.

695
00:46:59,104 --> 00:47:00,486
People are our enemies.

696
00:47:00,678 --> 00:47:06,400
So I like the idea of Trump doing 180 and I guess becoming a globalist sure.

697
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:11,260
Welcoming in immigrants with open arms, right? Yeah.

698
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:14,010
There's not good people on both sides.

699
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:14,680
Yeah.

700
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:26,666
What should we go for? Is he really looking for more of an extra 160 degrees to get them at a different clockwise angle? Because you don't want to go a full 180 degrees, do you? Go 240 deg.

701
00:47:26,728 --> 00:47:27,342
It's a metaphor.

702
00:47:27,366 --> 00:47:27,758
Wasn't good.

703
00:47:27,784 --> 00:47:28,962
Yeah, it's a bad metaphor.

704
00:47:28,986 --> 00:47:34,634
But again, the important thing to remember is that Alex is saying, like, hey, you're doing some good stuff.

705
00:47:34,792 --> 00:47:37,406
Essentially, the message is, Trump, you're doing some good stuff.

706
00:47:37,468 --> 00:47:39,750
You just need to stop it with the vaccines.

707
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:40,070
Right.

708
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:49,646
My audience will not tolerate you not being anti vax because under you and Operation Warp Speed, that's what brought these vaccines about.

709
00:47:49,768 --> 00:47:53,018
We need you to accept that it was wrong.

710
00:47:53,104 --> 00:47:54,122
Disavow it.

711
00:47:54,196 --> 00:47:54,650
Exactly.

712
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:58,158
Of course, it's too big of a hurdle for you just to ignore.

713
00:47:58,254 --> 00:48:04,526
It's great that you're shutting up about vaccines and how you want people to get boosters, right? But you need to go the other way.

714
00:48:04,588 --> 00:48:12,782
How about the new headlines for this are alex attempts carrot and stick towards person not paying attention to him.

715
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:14,438
We give him more attention for it.

716
00:48:14,464 --> 00:48:18,326
Or it would be great if the headline was, like, inside jokes for us.

717
00:48:18,508 --> 00:48:20,994
Alex tries to give Trump the rogen treatment.

718
00:48:21,042 --> 00:48:21,734
Yeah, exactly.

719
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:22,802
That would be good.

720
00:48:22,936 --> 00:48:26,646
Alex relitigating 911 with Rogen.

721
00:48:26,718 --> 00:48:28,490
Yeah, something along those lines.

722
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:29,942
Yeah.

723
00:48:30,016 --> 00:48:38,234
To say this is better than Trump, but I kind of hear this statement almost as a like, you hear this Trump.

724
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,226
You hear me saying, yeah, absolutely.

725
00:48:40,408 --> 00:48:44,570
The Santas is, again, just over the top with what he's doing.

726
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:47,390
This is absolutely presidential material.

727
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:49,706
This is what Trump should be like.

728
00:48:49,828 --> 00:48:53,354
And I've been hammering this point, and he's doing it now.

729
00:48:53,512 --> 00:48:59,390
And we have someone that is better than Trump, way better than Trump.

730
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:05,250
And I want Trump to decouple himself from the poison shot now, but I'm not going to sit here and hold my breath.

731
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:07,914
But that is opening the door.

732
00:49:07,962 --> 00:49:10,602
That if it does change my breath.

733
00:49:10,686 --> 00:49:12,640
I mean, he's nagging Trump.

734
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:15,734
He's fucking hating on Trump.

735
00:49:15,892 --> 00:49:18,866
He's complimenting DeSantis because he's trying to fuck Trump.

736
00:49:18,928 --> 00:49:20,234
Like, that's what's happening here.

737
00:49:20,272 --> 00:49:25,946
He's even using some of the same rhetorical flourishes towards DeSantis that he always does with Trump.

738
00:49:26,128 --> 00:49:31,180
Well, God has given us DiSantis, make no mistake about that.

739
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:34,790
For what? And I got a message for President Trump.

740
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,160
You are the real president.

741
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:40,458
I have fought for you.

742
00:49:40,604 --> 00:49:42,634
95% of what you've done has been incredible.

743
00:49:42,682 --> 00:49:46,062
You have amazing courage and energy, and I respect you.

744
00:49:46,256 --> 00:49:56,040
But if you continue to let this poison be pushing our people and our children, I'm coming after you.

745
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:57,490
Sure.

746
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:04,466
I'm not risking fuck off and going through hell to sit here and then have it on my conscience.

747
00:50:04,598 --> 00:50:12,022
All these dead and dying children and others that are taking your stupid, evil warp Speed crap that you got fooled and roped into.

748
00:50:12,156 --> 00:50:18,098
He's just trying to escalate this negative threat on the other side in order to be like, it's carrot and stick.

749
00:50:18,134 --> 00:50:19,906
Exactly what you're talking absolutely.

750
00:50:20,088 --> 00:50:20,830
Yeah.

751
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,286
This is pathetic.

752
00:50:22,358 --> 00:50:22,750
It is.

753
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:23,810
This is stupid.

754
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:24,238
Also.

755
00:50:24,324 --> 00:50:25,450
I forgot about that.

756
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,630
I forgot that he still believes in that Trump election.

757
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:41,558
How can you switch to another candidate if you think that the entire election is a fucking fake and that Trump should legitimately be president? And if that's the case, then Trump shouldn't be allowed because it would be his third term.

758
00:50:41,594 --> 00:50:42,180
Exactly.

759
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:45,710
And you're supposed to be the tip of the spear.

760
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:48,770
You should be the people not even talking about candidates.

761
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:54,970
You should be like, we need to continue the fight to get Trump back in the office that he theoretically won.

762
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,998
He doesn't need to do that because Lindell has got that car.

763
00:50:57,024 --> 00:50:57,646
Oh, my God.

764
00:50:57,708 --> 00:50:58,342
That's true.

765
00:50:58,416 --> 00:50:59,400
That is true.

766
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:01,570
You've already got a warrior on that front.

767
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:03,000
Lindell's keeping the fire.

768
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:13,874
So look, there's a lot of people who are delusional about vaccines that get them, and Alex proves this in a very succinct fashion.

769
00:51:14,042 --> 00:51:14,782
Look at this.

770
00:51:14,856 --> 00:51:16,082
Jack Pacific retweeted.

771
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:20,770
It Patricia carvalus.

772
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:22,042
Look at this.

773
00:51:22,116 --> 00:51:23,486
This is a real tweet.

774
00:51:23,678 --> 00:51:28,142
I just had my fourth dose after receiving listen to this carefully.

775
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:56,710
just had my fourth dose after recovering from three months of actively having covered 19.

776
00:51:57,450 --> 00:51:59,162
Now listen to the Stockholm syndrome.

777
00:51:59,246 --> 00:52:06,266
Listen to the mind control, and I'm very happy to be boosted thanks, science.

778
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:12,910
So she murders logic here, doesn't see what's being done, and then has the cult statement of thanks, science.

779
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:15,058
Like she's just trumped everybody.

780
00:52:15,204 --> 00:52:16,250
That was a tweet.

781
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:17,122
Yes.

782
00:52:17,316 --> 00:52:28,870
Can you imagine, like, an actual news outlet doing any kind of coverage of, like, someone tweeted that they got vaccinated and they didn't get covered and had no side effects? Ha ha.

783
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:32,602
I mean, what is this? Here's the even weirder part.

784
00:52:32,676 --> 00:52:39,146
How do you know this is a real person's account? This is like, 1920s newspapers.

785
00:52:39,338 --> 00:52:43,678
And including the part where he has a misogyny comment about her.

786
00:52:43,764 --> 00:52:57,538
Hey, listen, sweetheart, that's somebody writing in the New York Times in the 20s, like, oh, this lovely young woman walking through the street said, I got a vaccine yesterday for polio, and this, sweetheart, is looking good.

787
00:52:57,684 --> 00:53:00,550
What are you doing? It's insane.

788
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:09,550
So this next clip Alex proceeds talking about, he's still sort of responding to this tweet.

789
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:20,282
That sentence should be more that was the fun thing about listening to David Gareth on the show.

790
00:53:20,416 --> 00:53:29,850
As they were reacting to it, I got reminded of the first episode we did, especially when the prayer happened, and they were like I was like, this doesn't even faze us anymore.

791
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:31,010
This means nothing.

792
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:32,342
We need hard stuff.

793
00:53:32,476 --> 00:53:33,160
Exactly.

794
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:34,722
We're heroin junkie.

795
00:53:34,746 --> 00:53:35,320
Yeah.

796
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:43,262
There was something really sort of I was taken aback by that because I had forgotten even that.

797
00:53:43,336 --> 00:53:52,960
Like, oh, people are normal, right? Even people who are exposed to a lot of horrible stories on their own podcast, right? This is still surprising to some people.

798
00:53:53,350 --> 00:54:00,314
So as Alex is talking, you're not even going to be prepared for what's coming, and probably you'll be able to handle it.

799
00:54:00,352 --> 00:54:08,570
But for some reason, Alex's brain thinks of maybe a documentary that he's seen about sex workers.

800
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:11,942
I believe he's talking about hookers on The Point.

801
00:54:12,016 --> 00:54:12,640
Okay.

802
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:14,666
I think that's what he's talking about.

803
00:54:14,788 --> 00:54:15,230
All right.

804
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:20,342
And this leads to a protracted rambling about hookers on The Point.

805
00:54:20,536 --> 00:54:21,962
I forget the name of the show.

806
00:54:22,036 --> 00:54:28,794
I'm not a huge TV watcher, but it was on 15, 1617 years ago about pimps and prostitutes.

807
00:54:28,962 --> 00:54:35,690
Say pimps, prostitute with cigarette burns all over and broken arm and leg beat up by her pimp.

808
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:54,766
baby.

809
00:54:54,898 --> 00:54:56,634
She says to the pimp, I'm going to get better.

810
00:54:56,672 --> 00:54:57,838
I'm going to get back up on my feet.

811
00:54:57,874 --> 00:55:00,930
I'm going to get back down the street, baby, please don't hold, baby.

812
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:06,774
And they start interviewing the pimp, and they go, well, how do you treat her? He goes, I treat her bad.

813
00:55:06,812 --> 00:55:08,240
That's how she likes it.

814
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:13,260
Well, how much do you pay her? I pay her nothing.

815
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:16,510
I might give her a bucket of chicken.

816
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:20,758
And that's the American people, and that's the left.

817
00:55:20,844 --> 00:55:28,838
That's the American people that are left for this, all right? The Stockholm syndrome, right? She's had four shots.

818
00:55:28,994 --> 00:55:35,146
She's been sick for months after the first few shots, and now she's gotten another shot and thinks Kobage has taken her life over.

819
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:39,910
But this shot was 100% effective, they said, but the shot gives you the disease.

820
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:43,200
But she can't help it.

821
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:47,940
She can't admit she was lying to she can't admit the system is out to get her.

822
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:55,738
Just like that poor prostitute with broken arm and leg and cigarette burns all over her hair, falling out.

823
00:55:55,764 --> 00:56:02,410
You tell she's been a beautiful woman, and in comes the swaggering, arrogant devil right in front of the mother.

824
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:04,430
Oh, baby.

825
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:05,422
Baby, I'm sorry.

826
00:56:05,496 --> 00:56:06,754
I'm so let you down.

827
00:56:06,792 --> 00:56:09,960
I'm going to get back on the street right now as soon as I get better.

828
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:12,540
It's not good.

829
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:15,970
You better get back on the street.

830
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:17,530
Jesus Christ.

831
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:30,970
And the mother looks at him and says, what have you done to my baby? What have you done to my baby? He said, Shut up, you old bitch.

832
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:34,390
I can't believe I missed doing this show.

833
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:35,674
This is a family show.

834
00:56:35,772 --> 00:56:41,560
First of all, Alex is really getting into that.

835
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:43,986
He was embodying the character.

836
00:56:44,058 --> 00:56:45,810
Yeah, that was some method acting.

837
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:46,962
A little problematic.

838
00:56:47,046 --> 00:56:47,680
Yeah.

839
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:52,802
He said pimp and shot so many times, they both lost meaning to me.

840
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:58,850
Yeah, look, in my time, I watched some hookers on the Point.

841
00:56:58,900 --> 00:56:59,078
Sure.

842
00:56:59,104 --> 00:57:01,840
It was Titillating when I was ten or something.

843
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:03,846
Era.

844
00:57:03,918 --> 00:57:04,622
Right.

845
00:57:04,816 --> 00:57:06,170
I think this is that.

846
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:08,322
But I don't remember this particularly.

847
00:57:08,406 --> 00:57:13,730
I only recognize this from other times alex has told this story and played these characters.

848
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:17,906
He does really stuck out in his mind.

849
00:57:17,968 --> 00:57:24,338
I really don't like how much he minor complements the pimp in this.

850
00:57:24,424 --> 00:57:28,578
You know what I'm saying? Like, Income is the swaggering devil.

851
00:57:28,734 --> 00:57:32,394
Yeah, but the swaggering devil is kind of a compliment.

852
00:57:32,562 --> 00:57:34,494
Some people say you're a handsome devil.

853
00:57:34,662 --> 00:57:35,454
That's a compliment.

854
00:57:35,502 --> 00:57:37,110
And then he's got the voice.

855
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:42,220
The voice is not he's trying to be like, cool.

856
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:44,034
It's unfortunate.

857
00:57:44,082 --> 00:57:45,038
I don't appreciate it.

858
00:57:45,064 --> 00:57:51,698
I wanted to keep that clip in full just to get the really, the experience of how long this goes on.

859
00:57:51,724 --> 00:57:55,610
Yeah, I don't think Ron Philip causing is posting that one.

860
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:55,946
No.

861
00:57:56,008 --> 00:57:56,666
Maybe you should.

862
00:57:56,728 --> 00:57:57,098
Maybe.

863
00:57:57,184 --> 00:58:06,726
So Alex talked a little bit about Tucker and how he's maybe spreading some bullshit about how the FBI planted bombs on January.

864
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:07,550
For sure.

865
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:10,074
Yeah, it's totally in the white papers.

866
00:58:10,122 --> 00:58:10,874
I love it.

867
00:58:10,972 --> 00:58:14,546
Tucker Carlson is taking it into the danger zone as well.

868
00:58:14,608 --> 00:58:16,910
Everybody's up in their game or they're rolling over.

869
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:20,478
I should point out this is right after he came in for break to the danger zone.

870
00:58:20,574 --> 00:58:20,870
Yeah.

871
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:21,494
Okay.

872
00:58:21,652 --> 00:58:22,958
I was going to say that makes sense.

873
00:58:22,984 --> 00:58:25,410
Either going to get more hardcore or you're going to die.

874
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:27,890
You're going to either fight or you're going to be a slave.

875
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:30,518
Carlson came right out.

876
00:58:30,544 --> 00:58:35,874
We'll hit the next segment and said the FBI is the prime suspect with the pipe bombs and laid out the evidence.

877
00:58:35,922 --> 00:58:41,822
January 6, as it just came out, the FBI planted the pipe bombs and the bombs with the Whitmer case.

878
00:58:41,956 --> 00:58:44,070
Now they're having the next trial.

879
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:51,486
They already found the other people basically hung juries in the whole Whitmer kidnapping platte that was fake.

880
00:58:51,618 --> 00:58:52,790
That's all coming out.

881
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:56,658
So it's an incredible time to be alive.

882
00:58:56,814 --> 00:59:08,562
This is unfortunate bullshit for Alex to be spreading because on August 23, the day we're recording this episode, the final two defendants in the Whitmer kidnapping case were found guilty by a jury of conspiracy to kidnap.

883
00:59:08,706 --> 00:59:10,542
Adam Fox and Barrycroft Jr.

884
00:59:10,626 --> 00:59:12,090
Are definitely going to jail.

885
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:16,362
And their defense tried to use the entrapment argument, which was unsuccessful.

886
00:59:16,506 --> 00:59:20,442
This was their second trial after the first one in April, resulted in a hung jury.

887
00:59:20,526 --> 00:59:25,458
Alex is citing that in this episode, unaware that a few days later they'd be convicted.

888
00:59:25,614 --> 00:59:29,442
Two other accused conspirators were acquitted and two others pled guilty.

889
00:59:29,466 --> 00:59:31,994
So honestly, it doesn't seem like this whole thing fell apart at all.

890
00:59:32,032 --> 00:59:33,294
Actually, quite the opposite.

891
00:59:33,342 --> 00:59:36,402
Yeah, it was four out of six, something along those lines.

892
00:59:36,426 --> 00:59:36,686
Yeah.

893
00:59:36,748 --> 00:59:44,886
Also, the prosecution alleges that Croft actually made some explosives using mortar shells from fireworks that were packed with shrapnel.

894
00:59:45,018 --> 00:59:48,186
Nothing Alex says has any connection to reality whatsoever.

895
00:59:48,318 --> 01:00:11,898
Can you imagine Carlson saying, this shit is actually absolutely insane? This has been normalized so much, but can you imagine if a major news network came on shortly after JFK was assassinated? Like, okay, sure, it could be that guy, but maybe it was the fucking FBI who murdered JFK.

896
01:00:12,054 --> 01:00:15,062
And then everybody would just be like, Interesting point.

897
01:00:15,196 --> 01:00:19,240
Or maybe JFK wasn't even real.

898
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:22,070
He was a puppet.

899
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:24,590
It was a paper mache cut out.

900
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:29,834
And JFK jr actually is an immortal JFK Absolutely.

901
01:00:29,932 --> 01:00:30,194
Yeah.

902
01:00:30,232 --> 01:00:31,646
That makes more sense than anything.

903
01:00:31,708 --> 01:00:33,126
I'm getting an update from Twitter.

904
01:00:33,198 --> 01:00:36,810
Yeah, it looks like Loomer might have lost the primary.

905
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:40,050
It looks like she was ahead for a bit, but it looks like you might have lost.

906
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:41,514
All right, we can all breathe.

907
01:00:41,562 --> 01:00:42,858
A little bit easier.

908
01:00:42,954 --> 01:00:43,382
I don't know.

909
01:00:43,396 --> 01:00:44,490
There might be a recap.

910
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:45,820
Who knows? Yeah.

911
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:48,398
Anyway, let's get back to some actual news here.

912
01:00:48,424 --> 01:00:49,758
Alex is reading some headlines.

913
01:00:49,794 --> 01:00:50,282
Sure.

914
01:00:50,416 --> 01:00:51,498
Let's get back to the stack.

915
01:00:51,534 --> 01:00:58,118
I was already mentioned Jackie's top Biden adviser, Anita Dunn, divulges massive conflict of interest.

916
01:00:58,204 --> 01:01:02,958
She worked for Pfizer, but it's okay.

917
01:01:03,044 --> 01:01:11,698
I just had my fourth dose after recovering three months from actually having Cobra after the first shots, and I'm very happy to be boosted.

918
01:01:11,734 --> 01:01:12,750
Thanks, Science.

919
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:14,178
Yeah, it doesn't work.

920
01:01:14,204 --> 01:01:14,734
It's all alive.

921
01:01:14,782 --> 01:01:15,658
Thanks, Science.

922
01:01:15,814 --> 01:01:17,470
Getting a lot of mileage out of that tweet.

923
01:01:17,530 --> 01:01:17,898
Yeah.

924
01:01:17,984 --> 01:01:22,602
So Don is an advisor for Biden, but she doesn't really have a conflict of interest.

925
01:01:22,676 --> 01:01:24,874
Really? She didn't work for Pfizer.

926
01:01:24,922 --> 01:01:29,686
She worked for a consulting firm called SKDK, one of whose clients was Pfizer.

927
01:01:29,818 --> 01:01:36,910
She also was the Obama White House Communications Director for a while in 2009 and is working on a shitload of Democratic candidates campaign.

928
01:01:36,970 --> 01:01:39,054
Yeah, I was going to say I think I remember her.

929
01:01:39,212 --> 01:01:44,358
This isn't a big deal, but maybe it's a big deal, but not in the way Alex is making it.

930
01:01:44,444 --> 01:01:52,842
Alex doesn't know the basics of the story he's covering, but he's made up something he can work with and then juxtapose it with that tweet, which I guess is a dunk for him.

931
01:01:52,976 --> 01:01:53,890
So it's just dumb.

932
01:01:53,950 --> 01:02:07,354
There's nothing going on here I'd be fine with considering that a conflict of interest if we also considered Obama appointing, like Geithner as Treasury Secretary a conflict of interest not even start to unpack Trump's appointment.

933
01:02:07,402 --> 01:02:07,938
Exactly.

934
01:02:08,084 --> 01:02:09,178
Let's leave that alone.

935
01:02:09,214 --> 01:02:12,330
You want to talk about the culture in Washington? Yeah, fine.

936
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:13,458
Yeah, let's go for it.

937
01:02:13,484 --> 01:02:13,854
Yeah.

938
01:02:13,952 --> 01:02:20,218
Nobody is going to complain, right? That's a different conversation than the way it done was nearby.

939
01:02:20,374 --> 01:02:29,890
So Alex does take some calls and the first one who comes in suggests, hey, man, maybe we get MTG on a ticketg.

940
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:31,330
Light us on Friday afternoon.

941
01:02:31,390 --> 01:02:31,690
Alex.

942
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:33,030
I have a suggestion.

943
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:39,200
Trump has got a lot of legal problems right now, all right? He's getting old.

944
01:02:40,310 --> 01:02:44,250
He's had a real good record of endorsing candidates.

945
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:52,580
He should graciously step aside, endorse DeSantis, and have MTG as their running mate for Vice President.

946
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:55,350
I love it.

947
01:02:55,520 --> 01:03:03,294
Why do you think Trump obviously is not stupid and knows the shot was a lie? Why is he being picked at it? I don't know.

948
01:03:03,332 --> 01:03:08,154
Whether it's threats against his family or whether he just doesn't listen to people, I don't know.

949
01:03:08,192 --> 01:03:10,206
But this is a way out of it for him.

950
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:13,760
He can step out of the whole mess with the vaccines by doing this.

951
01:03:14,270 --> 01:03:15,114
Beautifully said.

952
01:03:15,152 --> 01:03:21,058
Spike, anything else? The prosecutor and the judge are not human in your trial.

953
01:03:21,094 --> 01:03:26,060
I hate to tell you they're replicas of some kind.

954
01:03:28,010 --> 01:03:35,240
That's a return regular suggestion of something that is pretty crazy.

955
01:03:35,570 --> 01:03:46,386
Let's put Mtpg in the White House with fucking insane and then to follow it up with the judge as a replicant should really disqualify the earlier yes.

956
01:03:46,448 --> 01:03:47,094
Mark as well.

957
01:03:47,132 --> 01:03:48,426
We all know Mark is a rep.

958
01:03:48,488 --> 01:03:58,440
Again, honestly, I'm willing to believe it's possible he was joking, but I don't know exactly.

959
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:03,770
We're in the danger zone, if you will, of joking about whether or not someone is a replica.

960
01:04:03,830 --> 01:04:04,440
Yeah.

961
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:12,550
I think that you can tell from that call he is not someone who is like, you have to stick with Trump.

962
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:13,714
Yeah, no, that's fine.

963
01:04:13,752 --> 01:04:17,222
That's not trump should step aside is pretty hardcore.

964
01:04:17,306 --> 01:04:18,310
Let's get rid of Trump.

965
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:18,682
Yeah.

966
01:04:18,756 --> 01:04:20,198
So here's another caller.

967
01:04:20,354 --> 01:04:25,586
How are you doing? Just a little insight on Trump and the vaccine.

968
01:04:25,658 --> 01:04:32,974
Are you there? I am sure I'm listening a lot, but I've never heard this brought up.

969
01:04:33,012 --> 01:04:47,662
I read Anthony, I mean, Kennedy's book on Anthony Fauche, and he expresses in there that Trump took a million dollars from Pfizer, and I just never heard anybody bring that up.

970
01:04:47,736 --> 01:04:48,130
He did.

971
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:49,162
Trump took campaign money.

972
01:04:49,176 --> 01:04:50,038
I think it's more than a million.

973
01:04:50,124 --> 01:04:50,338
Yes.

974
01:04:50,364 --> 01:04:57,718
Why didn't you bring that up, Alex? It seems like now that you're talking about a conflict of interest for Anita Done, it really seems important to bring this one up.

975
01:04:57,744 --> 01:05:11,194
Right there's, that fascinating thing that Alex does with his awareness, all of a sudden, it becomes okay to admit that the reality that everyone knows is there.

976
01:05:11,352 --> 01:05:14,950
This guy is saying, Why doesn't anyone bring this up? It's a pointed question.

977
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,102
That is not the tip of the spear.

978
01:05:17,126 --> 01:05:21,998
Isn't there? And that is, why didn't you talk about this? This isn't like his 2020 campaign.

979
01:05:22,034 --> 01:05:23,078
This is 2016.

980
01:05:23,174 --> 01:05:23,820
Right.

981
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:28,778
And Alex's whole presentation has been like, trump funded his own campaign.

982
01:05:28,814 --> 01:05:30,650
He spent millions totally.

983
01:05:30,770 --> 01:05:32,078
He self funded.

984
01:05:32,114 --> 01:05:36,902
He didn't take money from these other that's why he was such a straight shooter.

985
01:05:36,986 --> 01:05:37,306
Right.

986
01:05:37,368 --> 01:05:43,402
This is totally an indictment of Alex's false presentation that he's had for five years.

987
01:05:43,536 --> 01:05:46,714
And Alex is so casually like yes, he did.

988
01:05:46,752 --> 01:05:49,260
And not only that, it was more totally yeah.

989
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:58,514
That's such proof or a demonstration that what he is doing is gatekeeping this negative information from his audience.

990
01:05:58,562 --> 01:05:59,098
Yes.

991
01:05:59,244 --> 01:06:01,750
And that's pretty sad.

992
01:06:02,310 --> 01:06:17,160
And they themselves should be really bummed out about everything that they think personally if they are not capable, for one instance, of applying these criticisms retroactively to Trump from the very start.

993
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:20,606
Oh, I don't know why he's being pigheaded.

994
01:06:20,678 --> 01:06:23,086
Maybe he just doesn't listen to people well.

995
01:06:23,208 --> 01:06:23,950
Go back.

996
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:25,222
Go back in time.

997
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:28,654
Let's go back to that earlier time period when we were all so young.

998
01:06:28,752 --> 01:06:30,934
Maybe he wasn't listening to people then.

999
01:06:31,092 --> 01:06:34,294
Do you not understand? Yes.

1000
01:06:34,452 --> 01:06:37,260
So here's something that's slightly positive about Trump.

1001
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:55,654
Trump at this time is working to boost the primary candidates because he has this massive following and which would also help DeSantis whether he runs as VP or runs as President, because it's going to help create an America first agenda no matter what.

1002
01:06:55,692 --> 01:06:57,218
We know that's the paradox.

1003
01:06:57,254 --> 01:06:58,742
Trump's getting a lot of good people elected.

1004
01:06:58,766 --> 01:06:59,282
Not a paradox.

1005
01:06:59,306 --> 01:07:00,218
He's trading momentum.

1006
01:07:00,254 --> 01:07:02,030
So he's a flawed vessel.

1007
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:03,538
But that's why I'm still behind him.

1008
01:07:03,564 --> 01:07:04,078
Absolutely.

1009
01:07:04,224 --> 01:07:05,398
Still behind him.

1010
01:07:05,544 --> 01:07:09,638
So we're having this positive but the audience also looks kind of like wishy washy.

1011
01:07:09,674 --> 01:07:10,534
They don't really care.

1012
01:07:10,572 --> 01:07:12,442
But also, there's some other negative things about you.

1013
01:07:12,456 --> 01:07:13,970
We just want fascism.

1014
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:16,846
We don't really care who brings it to us as long as they're white.

1015
01:07:16,908 --> 01:07:17,650
Yeah, exactly.

1016
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:18,310
And a man.

1017
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:18,718
Yes.

1018
01:07:18,804 --> 01:07:20,254
Unless it's Margaret Taylor Green.

1019
01:07:20,292 --> 01:07:21,338
Then maybe we'll make an exception.

1020
01:07:21,374 --> 01:07:21,790
Exactly.

1021
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:27,194
But look, there's other things about Trump that apparently Alex just decided not to tell his audience.

1022
01:07:27,242 --> 01:07:27,706
Sure.

1023
01:07:27,828 --> 01:07:28,958
Hello, Alex.

1024
01:07:29,114 --> 01:07:36,662
I would like to encourage the United States to realize that Donald Trump and his family are working for the World Economic Forum.

1025
01:07:36,806 --> 01:07:43,694
And that's why we're not going to get leadership from Donald Trump is because he's in on it until he proves otherwise.

1026
01:07:43,802 --> 01:07:48,010
He's in on his daughter is the World Economic Forum young global leader.

1027
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:50,580
He put his daughter in the White House.

1028
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:53,938
She and Jared Kushner are working for the other side.

1029
01:07:53,964 --> 01:07:55,320
There's no doubt about that.

1030
01:07:55,890 --> 01:07:57,118
There is no doubt about it.

1031
01:07:57,144 --> 01:07:58,894
And Trump's working for the other side, too.

1032
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:11,374
This kind of conversation is pretty why doesn't this apply retroactively? Why doesn't this apply retroactively? If you're saying that he's working for the World Economic Forum, shouldn't you then go back to it? Maybe this caller does.

1033
01:08:11,472 --> 01:08:12,370
Oh, that's true.

1034
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,594
We don't know what this caller believes fully.

1035
01:08:14,642 --> 01:08:21,360
But yeah, I wonder also, some of this stuff really makes a question that 98%, 95% right about stuff.

1036
01:08:23,370 --> 01:08:25,306
He's already several things wrong.

1037
01:08:25,368 --> 01:08:27,802
But actually, I know a way around this.

1038
01:08:27,996 --> 01:08:32,398
Alex and his heart knew all this stuff, so he was right about these things.

1039
01:08:32,544 --> 01:08:33,790
He just lied.

1040
01:08:35,730 --> 01:08:38,654
That is a good point about the Alex Jones right crowd.

1041
01:08:38,702 --> 01:08:39,658
I was right.

1042
01:08:39,744 --> 01:08:43,258
I just told you the wrong thing on purpose because it worked better.

1043
01:08:43,344 --> 01:08:44,098
Right? Right.

1044
01:08:44,244 --> 01:08:48,938
Alex Jones right is a different story, if you're like, well, he's lying to us for good reasons.

1045
01:08:49,034 --> 01:08:50,662
In his heart, he was right.

1046
01:08:50,796 --> 01:08:51,130
Great.

1047
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:51,718
Cool.

1048
01:08:51,864 --> 01:08:54,250
So Savannah Hernandez comes on.

1049
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:56,002
Oh, yeah.

1050
01:08:56,076 --> 01:08:57,550
That's about the right response.

1051
01:08:58,470 --> 01:09:06,974
I can't stand listening to her in the same way that I have a tough time with that Patrick Howley guy and Harrison Smith.

1052
01:09:07,142 --> 01:09:11,520
The three of them have a real baby reporter vibe to me.

1053
01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:25,110
I don't know, there's just something about their delivery that I find it would be good voice acting for a cartoon about child detectives.

1054
01:09:25,230 --> 01:09:26,154
But we're reporters.

1055
01:09:26,202 --> 01:09:27,690
Yeah, they don't have chops.

1056
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:28,722
They have zero chops.

1057
01:09:28,746 --> 01:09:29,894
And they're young, too.

1058
01:09:29,992 --> 01:09:33,902
No, they could learn chops, but right now, no chops, maybe.

1059
01:09:33,976 --> 01:09:34,502
Yeah.

1060
01:09:34,636 --> 01:09:36,760
And so she has a big scoop here.

1061
01:09:37,270 --> 01:09:46,790
She has a whistleblower about some human trafficking going on that she should be careful, this might veer into defamation territory.

1062
01:09:47,170 --> 01:09:54,182
So this is government corruption and like you said, essentially child smuggling happening on a federal level.

1063
01:09:54,256 --> 01:09:54,914
MVM, Inc.

1064
01:09:54,952 --> 01:09:59,942
The same company that was already caught shipping migrants in the middle of the night to New York City.

1065
01:10:00,016 --> 01:10:06,686
They signed a federal contract with Joe Biden's administration back in 2021 for $136,000,000.

1066
01:10:06,748 --> 01:10:17,798
So I want people to understand that the biggest and most sinister angle of this story is that we are passing off innocent children to unvetted and properlyally identified adults via our taxpayer dollars.

1067
01:10:17,884 --> 01:10:19,478
Joe Biden funding all of this.

1068
01:10:19,564 --> 01:10:24,578
So this is a rare instance where Savannah Hernandez is not covering a completely false story.

1069
01:10:24,724 --> 01:10:26,678
It's just that it's not a new story.

1070
01:10:26,824 --> 01:10:31,202
The Daily Beast reported on the Biden administration having contracts with MVM Inc.

1071
01:10:31,276 --> 01:10:34,682
For transporting immigrants back in May 2021.

1072
01:10:34,816 --> 01:10:44,858
Savannah's report doesn't cover anything that's not already pretty well established as public information, but she does presented as coming from a secret whistleblower who has to appear with their face blurred out.

1073
01:10:44,884 --> 01:10:55,742
So it's big stuff, right? Conversely, the Daily Beast actually did some reporting on the story because, spoiler alert, this was actually a follow up article to the one that they wrote in June 2018 about the same stuff.

1074
01:10:55,816 --> 01:10:56,442
Ouch.

1075
01:10:56,586 --> 01:11:01,322
Alex and Savannah probably don't want to think about that, though, because that was during the Trump times.

1076
01:11:01,396 --> 01:11:11,742
And back then, this MVM had a $162,000,000 contract with the government compared to the $136,000,000 contract they have under Biden.

1077
01:11:11,886 --> 01:11:16,298
The actual story here is that their contract was lowered from this higher amount that Trump paid them.

1078
01:11:16,384 --> 01:11:17,762
But don't worry about that.

1079
01:11:17,896 --> 01:11:18,390
Jesus.

1080
01:11:18,450 --> 01:11:19,898
Anyway, the story is pretty fucked up.

1081
01:11:19,924 --> 01:11:21,590
Or kind fucked up, I don't know.

1082
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:27,702
MVM was a CIA contractor who provided security for CIA and NSA installations in Iraq.

1083
01:11:27,846 --> 01:11:36,702
They may have some logistics background, so they very well may be capable of helping transport migrants, but their company's history does not inspire much confidence.

1084
01:11:36,846 --> 01:11:44,202
That said, the claims that people like Savannah are making here about, like, a child smuggling operation are probably legally actionable defamation.

1085
01:11:44,346 --> 01:11:48,134
If I were Alex, I would maybe get this in check a little bit.

1086
01:11:48,292 --> 01:11:56,882
I think, especially now, it's a good change for MVM to go from being war criminals to just being regular domestic criminals of some sort.

1087
01:11:56,956 --> 01:12:00,400
I don't know how many war crimes they committed while being security.

1088
01:12:00,910 --> 01:12:02,402
Maybe some, I don't know.

1089
01:12:02,476 --> 01:12:03,590
I can't nail this down.

1090
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:04,946
But your point is taken.

1091
01:12:05,008 --> 01:12:05,630
Yeah.

1092
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:09,400
So, look, Savannah got hired at Infowars right out of college.

1093
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:11,378
That's right.

1094
01:12:11,524 --> 01:12:16,838
And then she went on to do such great things, but only because Alex had the wisdom to hire her right out of college.

1095
01:12:16,924 --> 01:12:19,362
Okay? Right out of college in Texas.

1096
01:12:19,506 --> 01:12:21,510
He hired Savannah Hernandez.

1097
01:12:21,690 --> 01:12:26,538
Then she left to go work with some of the biggest patriot organizations in America, the Blaze.

1098
01:12:26,574 --> 01:12:34,818
Now you can see her becoming a major investigative journalist in the fight against Tyranny Infowars mission.

1099
01:12:34,914 --> 01:12:42,330
Can you see her do that? Finding the leaders and giving them the platform to launch from? I literally had a vision.

1100
01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:48,340
25, sitting in Waterloo househouse, eating a chicken fried steak and drinking an iced tea.

1101
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:51,314
And I saw the future.

1102
01:12:51,472 --> 01:12:59,126
And the message was you are to build the platform to launch the generation of leaders to fight the new world order at the critical point they try to take over.

1103
01:12:59,188 --> 01:13:00,254
That really happened.

1104
01:13:00,352 --> 01:13:02,618
I told you for decades that happened.

1105
01:13:02,704 --> 01:13:04,334
And now you're witnessing it.

1106
01:13:04,372 --> 01:13:05,920
You have a lot of visions, man.

1107
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:08,106
Also, your team sucks.

1108
01:13:08,298 --> 01:13:19,430
If this is the next crop of patriots, they're untethered from the things that made the patriot community what it was in the 90s, which is what Alex grew out of.

1109
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:19,910
Right.

1110
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:25,730
They are, if anything, a withering vine on that tree.

1111
01:13:26,770 --> 01:13:28,610
Well, actually, that's not entirely true.

1112
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:36,138
It's just something that will be supplanted or grafted easily onto authoritarianism.

1113
01:13:36,234 --> 01:13:36,494
Right.

1114
01:13:36,532 --> 01:13:42,510
It will be consumed by that because it doesn't have the grounding in some kind of a philosophy.

1115
01:13:42,570 --> 01:13:43,902
As much as it sucks.

1116
01:13:44,046 --> 01:13:51,294
At least anticommunism is something that it has the roots, that has some kind of a tradition.

1117
01:13:51,402 --> 01:13:52,060
Sure.

1118
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:54,114
A horrific tradition.

1119
01:13:54,222 --> 01:13:54,566
Sure.

1120
01:13:54,628 --> 01:13:55,346
Yeah, sure.

1121
01:13:55,408 --> 01:14:09,946
But it does go back the cold war roots of that and the Fed, the conspiracies and stuff like that is a tradition for better or for worse.

1122
01:14:10,018 --> 01:14:10,254
Right.

1123
01:14:10,292 --> 01:14:19,990
And these people like Savannah, like Harrison and even Owen, they don't really have that background.

1124
01:14:20,050 --> 01:14:22,894
They just have the attention economy background.

1125
01:14:23,062 --> 01:14:33,274
And they're going to do the things that naturally or they'll gravitate naturally to the things that get attention and get a rise out of people owning the Libs.

1126
01:14:33,382 --> 01:14:33,942
Yeah.

1127
01:14:34,076 --> 01:14:36,966
And that's just not sustainable in any way.

1128
01:14:37,088 --> 01:14:42,610
It only flows downstream to less and less responsible actions.

1129
01:14:42,670 --> 01:14:42,966
Yeah.

1130
01:14:43,028 --> 01:14:45,390
One thing, I didn't own the Libs.

1131
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:50,506
McNeil and Larry, they didn't particularly care about owning the Libs.

1132
01:14:50,578 --> 01:14:52,530
No, they were busy.

1133
01:14:56,610 --> 01:15:08,138
I feel like we should have tracked if we could go back to the very beginning, we should track what foods Alex eats to what visions he receives.

1134
01:15:08,234 --> 01:15:09,170
Chicken fried steak.

1135
01:15:09,230 --> 01:15:11,642
That gives you a future reporter.

1136
01:15:11,786 --> 01:15:14,138
Like too much chili, that gives you vision.

1137
01:15:14,174 --> 01:15:15,598
You just forget your teacher's name.

1138
01:15:15,684 --> 01:15:22,190
I do think maybe he has indigestion.

1139
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:24,220
It does seem possible.

1140
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:26,174
Let's get that checked out.

1141
01:15:26,212 --> 01:15:26,774
Yeah.

1142
01:15:26,932 --> 01:15:28,600
You just got heartburn, man.

1143
01:15:30,070 --> 01:15:40,074
I'm thinking about this even more and there is like maybe David Knight is someone who actually was in the tradition.

1144
01:15:40,182 --> 01:15:40,840
Sure.

1145
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:46,094
I think about other people who were on air in the earlier days.

1146
01:15:46,192 --> 01:15:50,210
I don't know enough about where Jakari Jackson's head was at.

1147
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:50,738
Sure.

1148
01:15:50,824 --> 01:15:56,138
I don't think Leanne Mcidoo was an acolyte of those G.

1149
01:15:56,164 --> 01:15:57,234
Edward Griffin types.

1150
01:15:57,282 --> 01:15:58,238
No, absolutely not.

1151
01:15:58,264 --> 01:15:59,810
She won a contest to work there.

1152
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:07,634
She was an acolyte of other contest winners from whenever you used to have to have your hand on a car in order to win the car for the longest time.

1153
01:16:07,672 --> 01:16:09,162
That's kind of her tradition.

1154
01:16:09,306 --> 01:16:13,494
To be fair, at least the contest was an on air thing, not just touching.

1155
01:16:13,662 --> 01:16:14,800
That is true.

1156
01:16:15,490 --> 01:16:26,018
Although I believe Owen got his first job because he just needed to get airtime for the lawsuit or something along those lines, right.

1157
01:16:26,104 --> 01:16:27,798
No, he was wrongfully.

1158
01:16:27,954 --> 01:16:28,554
Wrongfully.

1159
01:16:28,662 --> 01:16:32,426
Fired at some radio station, and then they gave him 3 hours a night.

1160
01:16:32,488 --> 01:16:33,510
Yeah, that's complicated.

1161
01:16:33,570 --> 01:16:34,180
Yeah.

1162
01:16:34,570 --> 01:16:36,640
That was back in the sports radio days.

1163
01:16:39,650 --> 01:16:53,830
I think that there's a big division, and if what he's doing now is an attempt to create the next crop of folk, it will be a massive step downward, and it's just trolls.

1164
01:16:53,890 --> 01:16:54,474
Yeah.

1165
01:16:54,632 --> 01:16:56,660
You're talking about the garbage Patch Kids.

1166
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:58,350
That's where we're coming from.

1167
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:58,686
Yeah.

1168
01:16:58,748 --> 01:17:00,874
So I hope you enjoyed that chicken fried steak.

1169
01:17:00,982 --> 01:17:02,254
I hope you didn't.

1170
01:17:02,422 --> 01:17:10,518
So, yes, one of the questions that I think a lot of people had in our time away was, what does Alex think about the FBI raid on Mara Lago? Sure.

1171
01:17:10,604 --> 01:17:12,246
Turns out he does not care.

1172
01:17:12,368 --> 01:17:16,830
Is everybody's focused on Trump in the Marlago raid? I don't give a damn about that.

1173
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:18,390
It's bad, but whatever.

1174
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:25,834
We need everybody talking about the human smiling and the illegal activity happening, the closing comments.

1175
01:17:25,882 --> 01:17:28,866
Savanna hernandez 100% agree.

1176
01:17:28,928 --> 01:17:35,838
Alex Everybody is focused in on the Trump FBI raid, but again, there's bigger issues going on here in this country right now.

1177
01:17:35,864 --> 01:17:37,902
We need to be focused in on saving our children.

1178
01:17:37,976 --> 01:17:39,874
And again, just with the border.

1179
01:17:39,922 --> 01:17:40,134
Right.

1180
01:17:40,172 --> 01:17:44,790
That crisis in itself is horrible, but then we also need to focus in on the sexualization of our children.

1181
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:48,018
What school is the targeting of our children by? The LGBTQ company.

1182
01:17:48,044 --> 01:17:48,980
Oh, my God.

1183
01:17:49,430 --> 01:17:50,180
Wow.

1184
01:17:50,690 --> 01:17:56,242
Okay, so Savannah wants to protect children from LGBTQ.

1185
01:17:56,326 --> 01:17:56,960
Okay.

1186
01:17:59,010 --> 01:18:01,020
And I'm going to throw this out at you.

1187
01:18:01,530 --> 01:18:13,622
Should the FBI have rated, let's say, any previous president that wasn't named Trump or even Biden right now? It would be a very big deal to Alex Jones.

1188
01:18:13,766 --> 01:18:15,658
It would be a huge deal.

1189
01:18:15,744 --> 01:18:18,310
I think it's a good strategy for it not to be a big deal.

1190
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:23,666
It is a good strategy, especially after all the information has come out that's like, oh, this picture is looking worse.

1191
01:18:23,798 --> 01:18:25,670
Boy, he's got nuclear secrets.

1192
01:18:25,790 --> 01:18:27,334
Oh, boy, that's not good.

1193
01:18:27,432 --> 01:18:35,350
No, we don't focus on nuclear secrets being torn away from the White House illegally and the FBI searching about it.

1194
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:38,918
What we need to do is portray people as pedophiles.

1195
01:18:38,954 --> 01:18:39,370
Yeah.

1196
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:43,486
You know what I think is going on here is Alex is like, this is too big.

1197
01:18:43,548 --> 01:18:44,160
Yeah.

1198
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:53,860
If your best spin is, yeah, it's bad, but whatever.

1199
01:18:57,170 --> 01:18:59,778
I don't think you should be allowed to get away with that.

1200
01:18:59,804 --> 01:19:03,886
If I were Trump and I heard that, I'd be like, oh, shit, I'm going to jail.

1201
01:19:03,958 --> 01:19:05,454
I'm fucked this bad.

1202
01:19:05,492 --> 01:19:05,938
Serious.

1203
01:19:06,034 --> 01:19:07,040
But whatever.

1204
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:10,194
Isn't crying about this.

1205
01:19:10,292 --> 01:19:11,480
It's bad news.

1206
01:19:12,050 --> 01:19:17,098
That is like, borderline Alex just being like, okay, Bush did 911.

1207
01:19:17,194 --> 01:19:18,162
But whatever.

1208
01:19:18,356 --> 01:19:22,786
Moving on, right? So Alex gets back to calls.

1209
01:19:22,858 --> 01:19:28,518
He has Savannah go back to making sure get back to your whole cover.

1210
01:19:28,664 --> 01:19:31,042
Savannah Hernandez I don't think you can do that anymore.

1211
01:19:31,066 --> 01:19:31,902
She doesn't work there.

1212
01:19:31,976 --> 01:19:32,670
That's true.

1213
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:34,520
She's on to bigger and better, I think.

1214
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:39,462
So he goes back to calls and this is really, really fun.

1215
01:19:39,596 --> 01:19:49,770
So before the break, this caller had said, hey, Alex, I went to the library and I know that they and Alex hissed, instinctually.

1216
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:51,620
Got you.

1217
01:19:52,430 --> 01:19:59,610
She says, I went in there and I know that they have a system where you can request books that they should get.

1218
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:03,200
And so I decided I was going to request your book.

1219
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:09,030
What does Alex think? Here's what I would think if I was Alex.

1220
01:20:09,350 --> 01:20:10,662
I wrote a book.

1221
01:20:10,856 --> 01:20:13,760
He dictated a book.

1222
01:20:14,450 --> 01:20:17,840
His book is a great reset war for the world or whatever.

1223
01:20:20,310 --> 01:20:25,810
I've heard him talk about it, and it's mostly just transcripts of things he said on air about the credit.

1224
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,034
Yeah, it's a book.

1225
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:27,538
It's a book.

1226
01:20:27,564 --> 01:20:30,360
And then someone else weaved them together or something.

1227
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:32,470
Also the point of order.

1228
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:37,658
Glenn Beck has already released a book called The Great Retailer bummer Riding Coat Tails.

1229
01:20:37,694 --> 01:20:44,302
Copyright See, Alex obviously is thinking that the end result of this story is they said no.

1230
01:20:44,436 --> 01:20:51,480
Right? Listen, as he's disappointed by the news, I'm not being censored exactly.

1231
01:20:51,990 --> 01:21:05,794
Catherine in Michigan trying to put our new book coming out next week, the Great Reset the World of the World in Libraries, and the response she got.

1232
01:21:05,832 --> 01:21:06,970
So finish your story.

1233
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:08,590
I appreciate you calling, Catherine.

1234
01:21:09,150 --> 01:21:10,298
Hi, Alex Jones.

1235
01:21:10,334 --> 01:21:11,410
Thanks for holding me over.

1236
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:18,190
So I went to the library and went up to librarian's desk and asked if there's a form that I could fill out to order the book.

1237
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:19,658
And they didn't have any forms.

1238
01:21:19,694 --> 01:21:33,250
She handed me a little ripped up piece of paper, like a piece of printer paper, and said, write the name of the book and the author and we'll send it to our central library headquarters or whatever it is, and we'll request them to order the book for you.

1239
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:34,810
So I turned in a slip of paper.

1240
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:37,380
I thought I'll never see that case on paper again.

1241
01:21:38,190 --> 01:21:44,698
And lo and behold, I checked the library's database and they obliged me.

1242
01:21:44,784 --> 01:21:55,586
They ordered one copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, and it's on order right now, being sent to the district library.

1243
01:21:55,658 --> 01:21:59,110
That's beautiful because librarians still believe in the First Amendment.

1244
01:22:06,250 --> 01:22:15,102
Because the story didn't go the way Alex that's why he held her over the break, because it was supposed to be, yeah, they won't even let my book in the library.

1245
01:22:15,246 --> 01:22:15,806
Come on.

1246
01:22:15,868 --> 01:22:19,886
The way she was building that story up was leading to that.

1247
01:22:19,948 --> 01:22:20,478
Totally.

1248
01:22:20,574 --> 01:22:25,166
It's a swerve at the end, when the book is ordered the piece of paper I'd never see again.

1249
01:22:25,288 --> 01:22:26,738
They didn't have a form.

1250
01:22:26,884 --> 01:22:31,310
All of this is to build a conspiracy that they're trying to keep Alex out of the library.

1251
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:40,142
Well, I feel like her big storyteller, her big pitch was like, they only got one copy of the book.

1252
01:22:40,336 --> 01:22:41,560
I don't think so.

1253
01:22:42,070 --> 01:22:44,718
I think that was we got one copy in the library.

1254
01:22:44,814 --> 01:22:45,254
Okay.

1255
01:22:45,352 --> 01:22:45,854
All right.

1256
01:22:45,952 --> 01:22:51,590
I would be surprised if she's going to a big enough library that there would need to be multiple copies of any of that.

1257
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:53,250
Kind of maybe some of the classics.

1258
01:22:53,310 --> 01:23:00,546
I mean, shouldn't your opinion then be like, libraries don't even have the resources for forms.

1259
01:23:00,618 --> 01:23:11,010
They're just tearing printer paper up, and they're still working for me despite the fact that I went in there with a clearly confrontational attitude.

1260
01:23:11,070 --> 01:23:13,022
No, that shouldn't be it.

1261
01:23:13,156 --> 01:23:14,766
They love the First Amendment library.

1262
01:23:14,838 --> 01:23:15,290
Sure.

1263
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:15,890
Great.

1264
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,306
It's interesting, though.

1265
01:23:17,368 --> 01:23:23,954
I do think that I admire her ability to tell a story because she got you.

1266
01:23:24,112 --> 01:23:28,602
If I hadn't spoiled that in advance, you would have thought it was going in one direction.

1267
01:23:28,626 --> 01:23:31,434
It was going the only direction it could go on Info.

1268
01:23:31,482 --> 01:23:32,382
There was a reveal.

1269
01:23:32,466 --> 01:23:32,714
Yeah.

1270
01:23:32,752 --> 01:23:35,390
It's a disappointment, but it's a reveal.

1271
01:23:36,010 --> 01:23:37,058
It's not fair.

1272
01:23:37,144 --> 01:23:41,150
It's not fair for you to not give a shit when you're not censored.

1273
01:23:41,710 --> 01:23:43,298
But that's kind of what it's all about.

1274
01:23:43,384 --> 01:23:44,462
Yeah, obviously.

1275
01:23:44,596 --> 01:23:53,834
So Alex takes another call, and, man, he's really allowing a lot of that stuff that he kept behind that gate about Trump to come out.

1276
01:23:53,992 --> 01:24:03,638
I'm just going over the things that Trump did while being president and campaigning like, the campaign of Trump was completely different than the president.

1277
01:24:03,724 --> 01:24:13,290
Trump campaign promises will lock her up, build a wall, all these three word phrases.

1278
01:24:13,410 --> 01:24:18,006
But once he gets in, he partners the five megabanks for rampant fraud and corruption.

1279
01:24:18,078 --> 01:24:18,978
City Group JP.

1280
01:24:19,014 --> 01:24:21,738
Morgan Barclays, UBS and Deutsche Bank.

1281
01:24:21,894 --> 01:24:22,578
Deutsche bank.

1282
01:24:22,614 --> 01:24:37,646
He reported, like, $300 million to he openly talks about her sexual fantasies with Ivanka, like The Howard Stern Show and Oprah or Good Morning America or whatever, saying that if she wasn't his daughter, he'd be married to her.

1283
01:24:37,768 --> 01:24:39,618
He has the Epstein connections.

1284
01:24:39,774 --> 01:24:44,802
He was introduced to Melania through Gisley, Maxwell and Epstein.

1285
01:24:44,946 --> 01:24:51,054
Roy Dershowitz, where his lawyers alan Dershowitz is part of the Epstein thing.

1286
01:24:51,092 --> 01:24:51,718
Roy colin.

1287
01:24:51,754 --> 01:24:53,754
No, you don't think Trump's good.

1288
01:24:53,792 --> 01:25:01,146
So what do you think of Governor DeSanis? I don't trust any of them.

1289
01:25:01,268 --> 01:25:11,310
I think the Santa might be better than Trump, but I feel like people are just being funneled to the Sansa, just like people were funneled to Trump by Alex.

1290
01:25:11,930 --> 01:25:18,366
I mean, apparently even the proletarian of the Trump wing is beginning to figure shit out.

1291
01:25:18,428 --> 01:25:22,410
Well, except where he's not realizing that he's talking to the person who did the thing.

1292
01:25:22,460 --> 01:25:29,058
He's some people are funneling us towards DeSanis the same way they funneled us towards Trump.

1293
01:25:29,144 --> 01:25:36,366
It's almost like somebody earlier on this show was like, I'm going to support you doing that again over Trump.

1294
01:25:36,488 --> 01:25:45,886
And then they're funneling me towards and you just asked me that question right now is a way of implying that you are funneling me towards DeSantis.

1295
01:25:46,078 --> 01:25:46,578
Yes.

1296
01:25:46,664 --> 01:25:50,146
Or at least toying around with that to see if that's something that's tenable.

1297
01:25:50,218 --> 01:25:56,070
Yeah, but these kinds of things are not stuff that would have been allowed.

1298
01:25:58,010 --> 01:26:11,622
Curious listing of all the people in Trump circle that are connected to Epstein, considering Alex's big thing in all Alex Jones was write stories, is that he was the first person on the Epstein thing.

1299
01:26:11,696 --> 01:26:19,810
For them to now just be like, hey, did you remember that Trump is the whole Epstein guys? And Alex has constantly been like, yeah, I met him once or twice.

1300
01:26:19,870 --> 01:26:20,780
Yeah, exactly.

1301
01:26:21,950 --> 01:26:23,082
You can't have this.

1302
01:26:23,156 --> 01:26:35,878
And the idea of his debts and how beholden he may be to certain entities, these are not things that Alex would accept as reality.

1303
01:26:35,914 --> 01:26:37,230
He write back on these things.

1304
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:37,638
Right.

1305
01:26:37,724 --> 01:26:38,982
The gate is down.

1306
01:26:39,116 --> 01:26:56,586
And I think that matters somewhat because the overton window of conversation on his show seems to be a little bit more open to these things that are critical of Trump, based on the reality of Trump as opposed to the image of Trump that Alex has wanted to maintain all this time.

1307
01:26:56,648 --> 01:26:57,306
Right.

1308
01:26:57,488 --> 01:27:02,862
Stuff you would hand wave away with just like, he's not perfect, that kind of thing.

1309
01:27:03,056 --> 01:27:20,614
That's not specifically that is so funny because all of this stuff was widely known in 2015, and all of these people who you are literally speaking to right now work their asses off to make sure you didn't pay attention to that.

1310
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:21,142
Yeah.

1311
01:27:21,276 --> 01:27:25,210
Everyone in the Infowars orbit and all the guests and everything.

1312
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:35,878
It was an act of creating a false reality that would obscure this from you so you wouldn't make an informed decision about who you want to do elected president.

1313
01:27:35,964 --> 01:27:36,358
Right.

1314
01:27:36,444 --> 01:27:43,586
And now you're starting to realize that and not realizing the second part that totally has not changed any of his behaviors.

1315
01:27:43,658 --> 01:27:49,394
He's still doing the same thing and toying around with the idea of creating a false version of DeSantis for you to worship.

1316
01:27:49,442 --> 01:27:49,654
Right.

1317
01:27:49,692 --> 01:27:51,302
Because God has given us DeSantis.

1318
01:27:51,326 --> 01:27:51,514
Right.

1319
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:52,150
No.

1320
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:59,938
It is such that all the people in Britain like, hey, I'm starting to think this whole Brexit thing was a bad idea.

1321
01:28:00,084 --> 01:28:07,582
Now, of course, I'm going to vote Tory for the rest of my life and make sure that they're still allowed to do whatever it is they want.

1322
01:28:07,656 --> 01:28:11,686
US humans, man, we're crazy easy to lie to.

1323
01:28:11,808 --> 01:28:13,930
So this next clip is just kind of fun.

1324
01:28:13,980 --> 01:28:15,110
This is another caller.

1325
01:28:15,230 --> 01:28:16,810
Hey, thanks, Alex.

1326
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:27,790
Just wanted to say something here about I just watched your documentary with Aaron Russell where you interviewed him the other night and it was pretty compelling.

1327
01:28:30,510 --> 01:28:32,520
I think everybody should take a look at that.

1328
01:28:33,270 --> 01:28:36,622
2006? Yeah, something like that.

1329
01:28:36,696 --> 01:28:37,582
Yeah, it was great.

1330
01:28:37,656 --> 01:28:38,638
It was great.

1331
01:28:38,784 --> 01:28:39,298
It's great.

1332
01:28:39,324 --> 01:28:40,118
It was really compelling.

1333
01:28:40,154 --> 01:28:40,930
Powerful stuff.

1334
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:49,022
For those who don't know Aaron Russo, the interview that Alex did with him, this I believe, what was it? America freedom.

1335
01:28:49,046 --> 01:28:50,074
Or fascism, I think.

1336
01:28:50,112 --> 01:28:51,814
Or America destroyed by design.

1337
01:28:51,912 --> 01:28:52,174
Sure.

1338
01:28:52,212 --> 01:28:54,158
One of those titles.

1339
01:28:54,194 --> 01:28:54,780
Yeah.

1340
01:28:55,890 --> 01:29:06,098
That is heavily predicated on the idea that Aaron Russo became friends with a guy who was part of the Rockefeller family, and he told them all these secrets.

1341
01:29:06,194 --> 01:29:13,514
And what Alex refuses to recognize is that the guy that Aaron Russo was friends with wasn't related to the Rockefellers.

1342
01:29:13,622 --> 01:29:16,126
He's just a guy whose last name was Rockefeller right.

1343
01:29:16,188 --> 01:29:20,098
And might have been pulling some shit or so.

1344
01:29:20,184 --> 01:29:20,614
Right.

1345
01:29:20,712 --> 01:29:28,246
So that's a great documentary that came out, I guess, 18 years ago, and Alex has still not made a correction on that.

1346
01:29:28,308 --> 01:29:28,920
Right.

1347
01:29:30,630 --> 01:29:32,654
How many years ago is that? I can't do math.

1348
01:29:32,702 --> 01:29:36,166
It's like how Sam Raimi didn't apologize for Spiderman three.

1349
01:29:36,348 --> 01:29:39,674
You should have really said something before you got to do Multiverse of Madness.

1350
01:29:39,722 --> 01:29:41,170
I think it's worse.

1351
01:29:43,870 --> 01:29:47,778
What? How? It is worse.

1352
01:29:47,814 --> 01:29:50,090
I can't put it into words, but I think it's worse.

1353
01:29:50,470 --> 01:29:56,294
So you have one last clip here, and Alex has finished calls and he has another guest coming in.

1354
01:29:56,332 --> 01:29:59,620
I was so fucking confused by who the guest was.

1355
01:30:00,310 --> 01:30:00,834
SD.

1356
01:30:00,882 --> 01:30:05,274
Pluskin lieutenant, American Special Forces.

1357
01:30:05,442 --> 01:30:06,678
Two Purple Hearts.

1358
01:30:06,774 --> 01:30:08,334
Stalingrad and Linenrad.

1359
01:30:08,442 --> 01:30:13,010
What? Wait, what? At this point, I'm thinking he got snake twisted.

1360
01:30:15,670 --> 01:30:19,130
Russell, what is he are escaping from La on this one.

1361
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:23,454
What is happening? Bob hockey for the YouTube.

1362
01:30:23,502 --> 01:30:26,930
Pluskin Special Forces, texas thunder.

1363
01:30:29,690 --> 01:30:31,614
Bob Hock's a real person.

1364
01:30:31,772 --> 01:30:33,766
What? Not just leave and cleave.

1365
01:30:33,898 --> 01:30:41,420
Now I'm thinking, is it Bob hockey from the movie happening? I don't know what's going on.

1366
01:30:42,410 --> 01:30:46,738
All right, Bob Hawke joins us, ladies and gentlemen.

1367
01:30:46,894 --> 01:30:49,062
And let me tell you something.

1368
01:30:58,650 --> 01:31:00,874
but they've got something even better.

1369
01:31:01,032 --> 01:31:07,954
So when you go to the website infowars offgrid.com, they're so best survival gear and everything else.

1370
01:31:07,992 --> 01:31:14,014
But what they really got is not just satellite phones back in stock, but something even better.

1371
01:31:14,112 --> 01:31:14,686
It's better.

1372
01:31:14,748 --> 01:31:21,070
So, yeah, Robert Hawke is apparently the name of the guy who's the spokesperson for the satellite company.

1373
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:22,980
Bob Hawke is a real person.

1374
01:31:24,330 --> 01:31:25,630
It's confusing.

1375
01:31:26,190 --> 01:31:27,146
It's a journey.

1376
01:31:27,218 --> 01:31:31,046
It was definitely a journey to get to an infomercial.

1377
01:31:31,118 --> 01:31:31,498
Yeah.

1378
01:31:31,584 --> 01:31:39,826
Apparently the exciting new thing that they have is something you could put on your phone to make it a satellite phone and untrackable whatever.

1379
01:31:39,948 --> 01:31:40,270
Right.

1380
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:40,942
I don't care.

1381
01:31:41,016 --> 01:31:53,054
Yeah, it's a long commercial, right? Anyway, the point here is, as we come to the end of this and we wrap this up, the whole narrative about Alex turning on Trump is fraudulent.

1382
01:31:53,162 --> 01:32:09,954
And I don't think there's any way that I can look at it and say that anyone is responsible for it other than that Ron Flokowski Twitter account, the clip that was widely disseminated, they got over a million views.

1383
01:32:10,002 --> 01:32:18,426
That was all over the place, reposted a ton was from that Twitter account that created the conversation, and it was not accurate.

1384
01:32:18,558 --> 01:32:22,010
It created a false perception of what Alex was saying on his show.

1385
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:27,318
And maybe that only matters to me, and maybe it should only matter to me because I'm the person who watches.

1386
01:32:27,354 --> 01:32:28,130
This shit.

1387
01:32:28,690 --> 01:32:29,920
I don't know.

1388
01:32:31,870 --> 01:32:49,118
Again, considering the complicity that the media has had with Elevating, all of these fucking voices, sure, it's hard not to see them jump at the chance they didn't, like, see this, and then they were like, oh, maybe we'll write a story about this.

1389
01:32:49,204 --> 01:32:51,686
This was a fucking full court press.

1390
01:32:51,748 --> 01:32:59,558
But it created a lady feeling of like, haha, yeah, they want money, man.

1391
01:32:59,704 --> 01:33:00,702
It sucks.

1392
01:33:00,846 --> 01:33:08,860
And I think that the actual damage of something like this is something that's real.

1393
01:33:09,550 --> 01:33:20,226
There is a possibility that what you'll end up doing is eroding people's trust in legitimate critiques and news outlets.

1394
01:33:20,298 --> 01:33:22,098
That hurt the credibility of news outlets.

1395
01:33:22,134 --> 01:33:22,586
Absolutely.

1396
01:33:22,708 --> 01:33:30,806
And possibly lead people to trusting Alex Moore, which is a dangerous thing to do, and you shouldn't engage in that if you don't have to.

1397
01:33:30,868 --> 01:33:31,480
Right.

1398
01:33:32,530 --> 01:33:36,578
Ultimately, there's probably more dangerous things you could do.

1399
01:33:36,664 --> 01:33:36,986
Right.

1400
01:33:37,048 --> 01:33:48,770
And maybe this is not like the highest consequence kind of fuck up, but I think you got to hold yourself to a better standard, especially if you have the kind of reach that account does.

1401
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:50,694
And I find it troubling.

1402
01:33:50,862 --> 01:33:52,074
It's cumulative.

1403
01:33:52,182 --> 01:34:13,226
I mean, when you see all of the polls about how people don't trust the, quote, mainstream media, every time they report on that, they're like, look at how bad the electorate has been bamboozled without ever acknowledging that fucking you know what, there's a reason people don't fucking trust you.

1404
01:34:13,348 --> 01:34:21,594
And maybe it's not as bad as the reason that you shouldn't trust a lot of people, but just because it's not as bad doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

1405
01:34:21,702 --> 01:34:21,974
Right.

1406
01:34:22,012 --> 01:34:23,426
It doesn't mean that it can't do better.

1407
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:24,578
You can do better.

1408
01:34:24,664 --> 01:34:25,166
Yeah.

1409
01:34:25,288 --> 01:34:28,358
And that should be something that people strive for, and I hope they do.

1410
01:34:28,504 --> 01:34:37,350
Second, the notion that Alex's audience would be against him turning on Trump does seem to be not accurate.

1411
01:34:37,410 --> 01:34:46,598
Yeah, it seems like, especially from the picture that you get from all of these calls, that there's some fondness for Trump still.

1412
01:34:46,684 --> 01:34:47,690
Obviously, of course.

1413
01:34:47,740 --> 01:34:51,714
And I think you'd be acceptable if you would bend to the whims of these extremists.

1414
01:34:51,882 --> 01:34:56,738
But there's not a problem with shifting over to someone else.

1415
01:34:56,884 --> 01:35:10,340
I mean, it doesn't matter, because if Trump and Descents run in 2024, god knows what's going to be different.

1416
01:35:11,150 --> 01:35:16,642
Every year has been crazier than the last, and shit has gone wilder and wilder.

1417
01:35:16,726 --> 01:35:23,130
So predicting what's going to happen in two years seems like an idiot's game through, I mean, insane to do.

1418
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:44,062
And if you think for a single second, if you think for a single second that regardless of whatever legitimate criticisms these people are having towards Trump right now, if you think that when Trump becomes the nominee, they won't immediately forget all of those criticisms and get bogged down and like, well, we can't have Kamala, any of that shit.

1419
01:35:44,146 --> 01:35:45,286
You are insane.

1420
01:35:45,418 --> 01:35:46,138
You are insane.

1421
01:35:46,174 --> 01:35:47,382
It does not matter.

1422
01:35:47,516 --> 01:35:48,740
It doesn't matter.

1423
01:35:49,070 --> 01:35:50,934
Most likely will not matter.

1424
01:35:51,092 --> 01:35:52,222
I have an update.

1425
01:35:52,366 --> 01:35:54,630
Laura Loomer has refused to concede.

1426
01:35:59,490 --> 01:36:04,150
As far as the narrative arc for one episode, that is pretty goddamn good.

1427
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:07,090
I rarely look at Twitter while we're recording.

1428
01:36:08,250 --> 01:36:09,970
We got to get the narrative.

1429
01:36:10,350 --> 01:36:12,410
She's alleging voter fraud full circle.

1430
01:36:12,470 --> 01:36:13,354
So it's all there.

1431
01:36:13,392 --> 01:36:16,020
She's the rightful representative, of course.

1432
01:36:16,470 --> 01:36:18,974
Yeah, why not? Anyway, good to be back, Jordan.

1433
01:36:19,022 --> 01:36:20,498
It's great to be back, buddy.

1434
01:36:20,654 --> 01:36:29,954
We will also be back on Friday, of course, for another episode, and we'll get a little bit more caught up on the present day stuff and get back on our horse.

1435
01:36:30,122 --> 01:36:31,426
But until then, we have a website.

1436
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:32,230
We do have a website.

1437
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:33,214
It's Knowledgefight.com.

1438
01:36:33,252 --> 01:36:34,994
Yeah, we're also on Twitter.

1439
01:36:35,042 --> 01:36:37,250
We are on Twitter at knowledgeunderscorefights.

1440
01:36:37,310 --> 01:36:45,334
And again, that email address for buttons is Kfbuttons 69 At@gmail.com.

1441
01:36:45,372 --> 01:36:46,942
Every email has to begin with nice.

1442
01:36:47,016 --> 01:36:47,640
Yeah.

1443
01:36:48,930 --> 01:36:51,758
We will see you soon, but until then, I'm Leo.

1444
01:36:51,794 --> 01:36:52,298
I'm Leo.

1445
01:36:52,334 --> 01:36:53,330
I'm DCX Clark.

1446
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:54,854
I'm Wilford Snivel.

1447
01:36:54,902 --> 01:36:56,558
Snapper of the Gribble Pebble.

1448
01:36:56,654 --> 01:36:58,826
And now here comes the sex robots.

1449
01:36:58,898 --> 01:37:00,322
Andy and Chamvis, you're on the air.

1450
01:37:00,336 --> 01:37:03,554
Thank you for holding Alex.

1451
01:37:03,602 --> 01:37:04,474
I'm a first time color.

1452
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:05,294
I'm a huge fan.

1453
01:37:05,342 --> 01:37:06,106
I love your work.

1454
01:37:06,168 --> 01:37:06,340
I love.
