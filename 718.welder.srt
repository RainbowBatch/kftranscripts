1
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,470
Not Knowledge Party.

2
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,418
I am sweating knowledgebuddy.com.

3
00:00:20,504 --> 00:00:21,490
It's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,082
I have great respect for knowledge, Mike.

5
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:24,874
Knowledge.

6
00:00:25,042 --> 00:00:27,402
I'm sick of them posing as if they're good guys.

7
00:00:27,476 --> 00:00:29,240
Shanghi are the bad guys.

8
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:52,906
I love your word.

9
00:00:53,028 --> 00:00:54,180
Knowledge Fight.

10
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,280
Knowledgefight.com.

11
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,174
I love you.

12
00:00:59,272 --> 00:01:00,206
Hey, everybody.

13
00:01:00,328 --> 00:01:01,298
Welcome back to knowledge fight.

14
00:01:01,324 --> 00:01:02,178
I'm Dan George.

15
00:01:02,214 --> 00:01:08,018
Are a couple of dudes like to sit around, worship at the altar of Celine and talk a little bit about Alex Jones? Oh, indeed we are.

16
00:01:08,044 --> 00:01:08,874
Dan Jordan.

17
00:01:08,922 --> 00:01:10,926
Dan Jordan, quick question for you, buddy.

18
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:15,422
What's up? What's your bright spot? My bright spot today, Jordan, is the button stuff.

19
00:01:15,496 --> 00:01:15,950
Yes.

20
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:21,114
I may have underestimated the demand.

21
00:01:21,222 --> 00:01:22,334
Bright as the sun.

22
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,778
It is very bright.

23
00:01:23,934 --> 00:01:26,862
The number of buttons suggest very large brightness.

24
00:01:26,946 --> 00:01:30,990
It's a lot of requests.

25
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:39,190
It's hard to not just still be in the same headspace of, like, we're just doing a podcast on my desk.

26
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,718
Well, see, we haven't moved, right? Yeah.

27
00:01:41,864 --> 00:01:43,686
We're still in the exact same place.

28
00:01:43,808 --> 00:01:46,530
Nobody, like, else working on the show.

29
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,200
It's still just us.

30
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,422
So, like, the day to day of this feels kind of the same.

31
00:01:52,556 --> 00:01:59,250
Well, there were 40 people listening, and we did it like this, and now there's more, and we're still doing it like this, so how would we know? Yeah.

32
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:06,834
And I just can't conceive of the fact that there are, like, a ton of people listening in my head.

33
00:02:06,872 --> 00:02:14,166
It's still that same thing, right? Even compared to the last time we did this, it's a massive no, I don't even want button.

34
00:02:14,288 --> 00:02:17,002
I don't even feel comfortable saying that there are a lot of people listening.

35
00:02:17,026 --> 00:02:20,326
I feel like it makes us hubristically in trouble.

36
00:02:20,518 --> 00:02:21,334
It feels weird.

37
00:02:21,382 --> 00:02:23,938
But I appreciate the interest in these buttons.

38
00:02:23,974 --> 00:02:24,246
Yes.

39
00:02:24,308 --> 00:02:30,990
And I should tell you, Jordan, one thing I'm noticing from the early reports, we may have exploded in Scotland.

40
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,074
I don't know what it is.

41
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:45,310
Finally, I have been waiting to get my chance at the Fringe festival for decades now, and I'm there, baby.

42
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,990
Yeah, that was a trend that I was noticing.

43
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,326
And Washington is staying strong.

44
00:02:50,508 --> 00:02:51,830
A lot of interest from Washington.

45
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,778
Washington state or the man? Both.

46
00:02:54,864 --> 00:02:55,738
Okay, good.

47
00:02:55,884 --> 00:03:00,934
Also, Washington, the concept look okay.

48
00:03:01,092 --> 00:03:02,878
That didn't list it.

49
00:03:02,904 --> 00:03:04,766
You landed it the way it landed.

50
00:03:04,898 --> 00:03:05,590
Let's be happy.

51
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,242
So here's the situation that we have in front of us.

52
00:03:08,436 --> 00:03:12,058
Too many requests, too many I cannot handle much more.

53
00:03:12,204 --> 00:03:18,170
So we are closing the requests Friday, end of day Friday.

54
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,394
End of day Friday.

55
00:03:19,442 --> 00:03:21,790
So this episode is coming out on Friday today.

56
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,610
You are listening to this is the last day to get requests.

57
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,638
Let's call it Greenwich.

58
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:28,226
Meantime.

59
00:03:28,298 --> 00:03:29,518
Sure, yes.

60
00:03:29,604 --> 00:03:34,006
I will set the clock on my Gmail account to Greenwich Mean.

61
00:03:34,128 --> 00:03:35,686
I think that's the way to go.

62
00:03:35,868 --> 00:03:39,058
So get those crest in if you want to have them.

63
00:03:39,084 --> 00:03:44,506
And I'm sorry to people who are listening on behind, but there's just nothing I can do about that.

64
00:03:44,628 --> 00:03:45,662
It's ridiculous.

65
00:03:45,746 --> 00:04:00,286
Yeah, and another thing I wanted to say was that a lot of people have this is something that happened last time, too, and it's very kind of people a lot of people were requesting to help with postage and stuff, of course, particularly these Scots and other international ones.

66
00:04:00,468 --> 00:04:00,742
Right.

67
00:04:00,756 --> 00:04:05,590
And that is very appreciated and nice, but I like to do this as a gift to people.

68
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,860
And so there's no need to donate, there's no need to give anything.

69
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:16,802
But if you do feel so inclined to because I also don't want to be disrespectful to people's generosity.

70
00:04:16,826 --> 00:04:17,770
Obviously not.

71
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,086
We have started another GoFundMe.

72
00:04:21,278 --> 00:04:24,600
This one benefiting the Transgender Law Center.

73
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,266
It is over on GoFundMe.

74
00:04:27,338 --> 00:04:29,458
Little button theme to it.

75
00:04:29,484 --> 00:04:30,818
Let's put a button on the dreamy.

76
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:31,870
Dreamy Summer.

77
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,718
The pun was too good.

78
00:04:33,864 --> 00:04:34,270
All right.

79
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,220
I knew it.

80
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,078
So we've got a link to that.

81
00:04:37,104 --> 00:04:38,940
We'll put it up in the show.

82
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,114
Really excellent.

83
00:04:41,162 --> 00:04:45,406
Today, item number 7000, in case against us being good with money.

84
00:04:45,468 --> 00:04:46,080
Yes.

85
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,130
It would be great if you wanted to chip into that donation for a good cause.

86
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:51,854
That would be lovely.

87
00:04:51,902 --> 00:04:57,286
How about you? What's your not making? But I offered my help, sir.

88
00:04:57,348 --> 00:04:57,960
True.

89
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:17,834
my bright spot is at Spock and on Twitter sent me a Bound version of my book with a beautiful cover.

90
00:05:17,932 --> 00:05:21,554
And it was bound with love and inside it was actually my book.

91
00:05:21,592 --> 00:05:23,490
It wasn't like a cover that was dummy.

92
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,026
No.

93
00:05:24,148 --> 00:05:27,170
It was kind of surprising and amazing.

94
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:35,930
And as a writer, I feel like the only way I can kind of express how I feel would be the word indescribable.

95
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,214
That is going to be through songs.

96
00:05:38,262 --> 00:05:42,234
No, but yeah, it's incredible.

97
00:05:42,282 --> 00:05:44,440
It's something I never thought I would ever see.

98
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,410
I told you this when that came in.

99
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:54,234
I told you that for the last couple of months, I have been planning to get you a bound copy.

100
00:05:54,282 --> 00:05:55,300
Yeah, I know.

101
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:07,658
Our friend Angela Lampsberry had designed a cover for it and everything we were you conspired against me and I kept forgetting I'll beat you to it.

102
00:06:07,684 --> 00:06:07,874
Right.

103
00:06:07,912 --> 00:06:12,590
And they also sent some empty notebooks that are really cool for me.

104
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,786
So thank you for me as well.

105
00:06:14,848 --> 00:06:15,182
Yes.

106
00:06:15,256 --> 00:06:15,966
Fantastic.

107
00:06:16,038 --> 00:06:16,494
Indeed.

108
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:16,862
Yeah.

109
00:06:16,936 --> 00:06:19,226
So, Jordan, today we have an episode to go over.

110
00:06:19,348 --> 00:06:19,758
Excellent.

111
00:06:19,794 --> 00:06:25,322
Two of them we're going to be talking about August 21 and 22nd, 2022.

112
00:06:25,396 --> 00:06:25,766
All right.

113
00:06:25,828 --> 00:06:27,220
How do you do? Okay.

114
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,994
These are Sunday and Monday.

115
00:06:30,102 --> 00:06:43,674
And the reason that we're going to this day is because Sunday evening in Russia time, which would have been during the day here, alexander Dugan's daughter was killed at car bombing.

116
00:06:43,722 --> 00:06:44,330
Right.

117
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:50,502
And as we know, Alex is somebody who has had Dugan on his show, and he's been on his show in Russia.

118
00:06:50,646 --> 00:06:55,586
And so I think a lot of people are pretty curious to see how this was responded to.

119
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:56,018
Sure.

120
00:06:56,104 --> 00:06:57,726
They might be underwhelmed.

121
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,294
Have they ever not been.

122
00:06:59,392 --> 00:07:01,662
Yeah, so we'll get into that here Jordan.

123
00:07:01,686 --> 00:07:04,910
But first, let's say a little hello to some new walk.

124
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,822
Oh, that's great idea.

125
00:07:05,896 --> 00:07:08,214
So first, the way back machines, faulty server.

126
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:08,762
Thank you so much.

127
00:07:08,776 --> 00:07:09,974
You are now a policy walk.

128
00:07:10,072 --> 00:07:11,054
I'm a policy walk.

129
00:07:11,092 --> 00:07:12,206
Thank you very much.

130
00:07:12,388 --> 00:07:12,914
Next.

131
00:07:13,012 --> 00:07:16,398
If you can pronounce them as Sarah, you can pronounce my name sarah.

132
00:07:16,434 --> 00:07:16,958
Thank you so much.

133
00:07:16,984 --> 00:07:18,206
You're now a policy walk.

134
00:07:18,328 --> 00:07:19,694
I'm a policy walk.

135
00:07:19,852 --> 00:07:21,338
I'm not sure I can pronounce that.

136
00:07:21,364 --> 00:07:21,486
It's.

137
00:07:21,498 --> 00:07:27,434
Where Wonder Woman's from the Messera? Wait, what it might be? I don't know.

138
00:07:27,472 --> 00:07:29,140
Yeah, I can't pronounce anything.

139
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:29,966
Next.

140
00:07:30,028 --> 00:07:30,654
Juice pants.

141
00:07:30,702 --> 00:07:31,238
Thank you so much.

142
00:07:31,264 --> 00:07:32,442
You're now a policy wonk.

143
00:07:32,526 --> 00:07:33,462
I'm a policy wonk.

144
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:34,142
Thank you very much.

145
00:07:34,216 --> 00:07:35,058
Nailed juicepants.

146
00:07:35,094 --> 00:07:36,630
Yeah, I can pronounce nailed juicepants.

147
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:36,986
Next.

148
00:07:37,048 --> 00:07:38,874
SMORGAS, buns, gout and tits.

149
00:07:38,922 --> 00:07:39,542
Thank you so much.

150
00:07:39,556 --> 00:07:40,842
You're now a policy wonk.

151
00:07:40,926 --> 00:07:41,894
I'm a policy walk.

152
00:07:41,932 --> 00:07:43,180
Thank you very much.

153
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,434
Next here.

154
00:07:45,472 --> 00:07:47,466
I Thong Dubai.

155
00:07:47,538 --> 00:07:48,218
Thank you so much.

156
00:07:48,244 --> 00:07:49,530
You are now a policy wonk.

157
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,622
I'm a policy wonk.

158
00:07:50,646 --> 00:07:51,700
Thank you very much.

159
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:55,814
I had a phonetic explanation that I still think I got it wrong.

160
00:07:55,852 --> 00:07:56,474
I understand.

161
00:07:56,572 --> 00:07:56,942
Next.

162
00:07:57,016 --> 00:07:57,254
Help.

163
00:07:57,292 --> 00:07:58,602
I think my cat's homophobic.

164
00:07:58,626 --> 00:07:59,138
Thank you so much.

165
00:07:59,164 --> 00:08:00,458
You and I have a policy want.

166
00:08:00,604 --> 00:08:01,694
I'm a policy won.

167
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:02,414
Thank you very much.

168
00:08:02,452 --> 00:08:03,470
I assure you they're not.

169
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:03,914
Yeah.

170
00:08:04,012 --> 00:08:04,598
Next.

171
00:08:04,744 --> 00:08:06,486
And we had a technical credit in the mix.

172
00:08:06,558 --> 00:08:08,020
Next is a tax credit.

173
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,330
Look, we're a little bit behind hey, it's going great.

174
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,210
We're a little bit behind on these, but carissa.

175
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,790
Happy fourth anniversary.

176
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,694
There was no little break ease for us.

177
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:20,522
Thank you so much.

178
00:08:20,596 --> 00:08:22,278
You are now a technocrat.

179
00:08:22,374 --> 00:08:23,574
I'm a policy wonk.

180
00:08:23,622 --> 00:08:26,886
I have risen above my enemies.

181
00:08:27,018 --> 00:08:28,358
I might quit tomorrow, actually.

182
00:08:28,444 --> 00:08:40,082
I'm just going to take a little break you down a little breaky for me and then we're going to come back and I'm going to start the show over.

183
00:08:40,216 --> 00:08:42,580
I'm the devil, I got to be taking over here.

184
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,406
Fuck you.

185
00:08:46,528 --> 00:08:54,762
I got plenty of words for you, but at the end of the day, fuck you in your new world order and fuck the horse you rode in on and all your shit.

186
00:08:54,906 --> 00:08:56,850
Maybe today should be my last broadcast.

187
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,500
Maybe I'll just be gone a month, maybe five years.

188
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,880
Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow and you never see me again.

189
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,220
That's really what I want to do.

190
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,366
I never want to come back here again.

191
00:09:08,488 --> 00:09:15,040
I apologize to the crew and the listeners yesterday that I was legitimately having breakdowns on here.

192
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,818
I'll be better tomorrow.

193
00:09:16,914 --> 00:09:17,498
He's not.

194
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:20,166
Oh, happy anniversary.

195
00:09:20,238 --> 00:09:27,242
I appreciate the anniversaries because with so many anniversary requests for a lot of people, they're like, oh, I know when it's going to come.

196
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,154
It's going to come on the day of our anniversary.

197
00:09:29,262 --> 00:09:32,354
But in this case, it's a surprise to both of you.

198
00:09:32,512 --> 00:09:35,930
You never know when we're going to give wish you a happy anniversary.

199
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,530
You might have been expecting it to come months later.

200
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,610
Yeah, absolutely.

201
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,066
It's always a shock.

202
00:09:42,198 --> 00:09:48,306
So here we start, and Alex does get to the news of the car bombing right out of the gate.

203
00:09:48,438 --> 00:09:51,182
Alexander Dugan has been on our broadcast before.

204
00:09:51,256 --> 00:10:02,680
I've been on some of his shows in Russia, and he is a Russian nationalist, not a fascist, as our corporate control media has said.

205
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:23,646
And in the lead up to this open proxy war with the Russians in Ukraine, you can pull up the news articles with Republican Democrat senators and others like Lindsey Graham calling for the assassination of Vladimir Putin and people like Alexander Dugan.

206
00:10:23,718 --> 00:10:32,430
So Alex is telling on himself a little bit in the way that this defense of Dugan begins, with him saying that Dugan has been on his show and Alex has been on Dugan's broadcast in Russia.

207
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,534
Well, this is a person who likes Alex, and Alex likes him.

208
00:10:35,572 --> 00:10:38,618
And by definition, Alex doesn't like fascists and they don't like him.

209
00:10:38,644 --> 00:10:40,802
So Dugan couldn't possibly be one that simple.

210
00:10:40,876 --> 00:10:42,642
He's just a good old fashioned nationalist.

211
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,374
I mean, except that Alex does like fascist quite a bit.

212
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:45,686
Yeah.

213
00:10:45,748 --> 00:10:52,062
In reality, Dugan is an ultra nationalist and someone who is staunchly in favor of a return to Russian imperialism.

214
00:10:52,206 --> 00:10:56,838
I don't want to quibble about whether or not his ideas would strictly be called fascistic.

215
00:10:56,874 --> 00:11:01,490
Like in an academic setting, it's fair enough to say that he's pretty much in the ballpark.

216
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:07,058
You know what? When you go with warmonger and fascist, I really don't feel like there's that much of a difference.

217
00:11:07,144 --> 00:11:10,130
At the end of the day, then, there are distinctions, but I know what you mean.

218
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:10,502
Yes.

219
00:11:10,576 --> 00:11:20,274
For those who have not heard the news, on Sunday, August 21, dugan's daughter Dario was killed in a car bomb attack while leaving an event she attended that night called Tradition.

220
00:11:20,442 --> 00:11:24,090
In the aftermath, Russian intelligence has blamed forces from Ukraine.

221
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,478
While Ukraine has denied all involvement.

222
00:11:26,634 --> 00:11:33,962
Others have suggested that the attack was carried out by fringe groups within Russia, or possibly even the Russian intelligence services themselves.

223
00:11:34,096 --> 00:11:34,538
Sure.

224
00:11:34,624 --> 00:11:41,130
Ultimately, it's very much unknown at this point who did it, and it may be something that's never really nailed down concretely.

225
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,640
We may never know.

226
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:50,486
Let's just back up and let's spread out and let's take a larger view here.

227
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,130
I'll tell you who did it.

228
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,860
Someone who declared war.

229
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,862
Someone who was up to no good.

230
00:11:55,936 --> 00:12:00,186
That's what I would suggest, is, if you declare war, who did it? A car bombing.

231
00:12:00,318 --> 00:12:06,290
Well, yeah, but I mean, if Putin declares war and then bombings start happening, it's like, you're at war, man.

232
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,358
Like, you earned it.

233
00:12:07,444 --> 00:12:08,620
That's how it goes.

234
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,330
I feel like you don't get to be mad about it.

235
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,070
I can see your perspective.

236
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:17,498
I'm less interested from what I was saying.

237
00:12:17,584 --> 00:12:17,834
Sure.

238
00:12:17,872 --> 00:12:23,346
I'm less interested in that position of natural and more like, who knows who did it? Oh, God knows.

239
00:12:23,478 --> 00:12:23,954
Yeah.

240
00:12:24,052 --> 00:12:28,254
That is going to be a discussion that a lot of people are having, especially people like Alex.

241
00:12:28,302 --> 00:12:28,730
Right.

242
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,402
It's the was it this side or that side? Whatever.

243
00:12:32,536 --> 00:12:35,354
What you're saying is the Alzheimer in love and war.

244
00:12:35,452 --> 00:12:39,318
I mean, I'm not saying all is fair, I'm just saying that it takes two to tango.

245
00:12:39,474 --> 00:12:40,180
Sure.

246
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:49,254
So I wanted to take this opportunity, though here to call myself out for some of the coverage of Dugan back when he was on Alex's show Circuit 2017.

247
00:12:49,422 --> 00:13:04,274
I'll stand by my statements that it was a really big deal that that crossover was happening, but I think I probably was too credulous of the media stories that I was reading at the time that painted Dugan as being much more connected to Putin and the official government channels that he may actually be.

248
00:13:04,432 --> 00:13:11,934
I'm not entirely sure how much of that is real, that he's really influential, how much of it is bluster.

249
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:18,378
And if I were approaching the show the same way that I am now, back then, I probably would have presented it a little bit differently.

250
00:13:18,534 --> 00:13:28,370
I still would have presented their collaboration as troubling, though, because whether or not Dugan is closely associated with Putin, he's definitely associated with international far right extremists.

251
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:33,210
In 2018, Lauren Southern posted an image of herself in Dugan meeting.

252
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:41,382
And this was back when Lauren was making completely fraudulent documentaries meant to demonize immigrants and was going on adventures to intercept migrant boats.

253
00:13:41,466 --> 00:13:47,490
Along with members of Generation Identity, a group with links to the guy who carried out the shooting at that mosque in Christchurch.

254
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:47,882
Right.

255
00:13:47,956 --> 00:13:50,334
And also going on tour with Stefan Molyneux.

256
00:13:50,382 --> 00:13:50,846
Right.

257
00:13:50,968 --> 00:13:52,946
What she refers to as the good old days.

258
00:13:53,008 --> 00:13:53,198
Yeah.

259
00:13:53,224 --> 00:13:59,318
This wasn't her meeting with Dugan and her now softer, like Glenn Beck in a sweater with Samantha B.

260
00:13:59,344 --> 00:14:01,454
S rebrand trying to pull off.

261
00:14:01,492 --> 00:14:01,982
Yeah.

262
00:14:02,116 --> 00:14:07,374
Fellow antiimmigrant educator Brittany Pettbone was along with Southern for her trip to meet Dugan.

263
00:14:07,482 --> 00:14:18,098
Incidentally, Petty Bone would go on to marry Generation Identity leader Martin Sellsner, whose home was rated after it was revealed that the Christchurch shooter had donated a disproportionately high amount to his group.

264
00:14:18,184 --> 00:14:18,614
Great.

265
00:14:18,712 --> 00:14:24,530
Weird, too, that a guy from New Zealand would make a larger donation to a random bigot group in Austria without having any connections to that.

266
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,626
It's so odd.

267
00:14:25,758 --> 00:14:26,850
There are other connections.

268
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:32,214
But even beyond that, the influence Duggan has had on a lot of the ascending far right figures is something that matters.

269
00:14:32,262 --> 00:14:56,018
Given his belief set, as he wrote in his book Foundations of Geopolitics, quote, it is essentially important to introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements, extremist racist and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the United States.

270
00:14:56,104 --> 00:15:09,846
Naturally, this is a book that's been promoted by people like Jack Pizzobic and Richard Spencer, who are probably, not coincidentally, figures, who are working to introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity and encouraging all kinds of separatism.

271
00:15:09,918 --> 00:15:11,534
Yeah, it is weird how that worked out.

272
00:15:11,572 --> 00:15:11,874
Weird.

273
00:15:11,922 --> 00:15:12,278
Yeah.

274
00:15:12,364 --> 00:15:23,562
Anyway, the point is that it's still super fucked up that Alex feels this kinship with Dugan and that they've been on each other's show, but I think, in hindsight a little bit off base with how connected I believed him to be to Putin.

275
00:15:23,586 --> 00:15:25,070
What? I talked about him before, sure.

276
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:31,818
And he's not come up necessarily in any large way, but I've been meaning to address that in some fashion.

277
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:42,762
Well, I mean, it's regularly reported of him that he's the philosophical architect of the current Russian imperialist strategy.

278
00:15:42,906 --> 00:15:52,610
You could say that he's well connected in the inner circle, but that's not quite the same thing as being socially and so forth connected in that way.

279
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,580
And it's tough to say, really.

280
00:15:54,970 --> 00:16:10,946
I've heard enough counter report of that, and I've also heard from some listeners who are in Russia or even just in the surrounding area who have very different take in terms of what his position is.

281
00:16:11,128 --> 00:16:12,294
Visa VPN.

282
00:16:12,342 --> 00:16:19,660
Well, it's not hard to think that we can attribute that to him and have nothing to do with him, actually.

283
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:26,490
What is the difference between some dude writing that and Putin just being like, hey, you know, it's a good idea fucking up America.

284
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:31,566
It's not that complicated of a strategy, it's just going in there and wrecking shit.

285
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:32,500
Right.

286
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:39,134
It's the difference between being on the same page and someone like having your email.

287
00:16:39,172 --> 00:16:39,662
Exactly.

288
00:16:39,796 --> 00:16:40,418
Yeah.

289
00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:41,942
There is a difference to it.

290
00:16:41,956 --> 00:16:42,470
Yeah, absolutely.

291
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,842
Some of it is fundamentally the effects of it may be the same.

292
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:46,540
Sure.

293
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:59,886
Anyway, Alex is mad at the media coverage, of course, of this story, and it's because people are suggesting maybe it was a false flag and that's Alex's turf.

294
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:18,478
less than a day ago, his daughter driving back in his car, he was another vehicle, the idea that he or Putin would blow up his own daughter is preposterous.

295
00:17:18,514 --> 00:17:24,562
But the London Telegraph, the BBC, US News, they're running the headlines.

296
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:25,666
It's a false flag.

297
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:34,806
So I supposedly lose 40 something million dollar rigged lawsuits for questioning events saying they could be staged or fake or the system targeting itself.

298
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:41,170
But on the Telegraph and others can say, it woah Nelly, just don't talk about it anymore.

299
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,922
Why? Complicated.

300
00:17:43,066 --> 00:17:43,662
I don't know.

301
00:17:43,736 --> 00:17:44,614
It's insane.

302
00:17:44,722 --> 00:17:46,170
I can confirm that at least.

303
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:54,106
The Telegraph suggested that the attack was possibly a false flag meant to incite the public into supporting further hostilities in frame.

304
00:17:54,238 --> 00:17:57,250
I'm not sure if that was the widespread media theory.

305
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:06,694
And many folks who are actually suggesting that the attack might have been carried out by Russian actors have specifically speculated that it could have been the work of a group unaligned with Putin.

306
00:18:06,742 --> 00:18:07,314
Right.

307
00:18:07,472 --> 00:18:13,750
Somebody who's some dissident, let's take a crack at somebody that we think is a target.

308
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:23,494
There are a number of suggestions that people have had and the argument that alex is making, where it's like a lot of people are coming out and saying that it was Dugan blowing up his own daughter.

309
00:18:23,542 --> 00:18:24,140
Right.

310
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:28,194
I don't know how widespread of belief that is.

311
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:31,594
It's just fundamentally it's unfair.

312
00:18:31,702 --> 00:18:34,086
Alex doesn't get to say shit right now.

313
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,074
Unfair.

314
00:18:35,242 --> 00:18:35,682
Yeah.

315
00:18:35,756 --> 00:18:38,014
I mean, it falls a little on deaf ears.

316
00:18:38,062 --> 00:18:38,418
Yeah.

317
00:18:38,504 --> 00:18:43,782
And he isn't getting sued for suggesting that something could be a false flag or for questioning an event.

318
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:47,442
If that were possible, he would be getting sued every day.

319
00:18:47,576 --> 00:18:49,962
He defamed people, which isn't the same thing.

320
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:57,346
Also, I'm not sure what defamation laws are like in Russia, but based on the US standard, dugan and his daughter are definitely public figures.

321
00:18:57,418 --> 00:19:04,734
So talking about the possibility that the attack could have been a false flag wouldn't rise to the level of actual malice required to be defamation against them.

322
00:19:04,832 --> 00:19:09,934
Just one of the reasons why Alex doesn't get sued for all the shitty talks about celebrity public figures.

323
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:10,580
Yeah.

324
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:14,970
I wouldn't worry too much about the defamation laws in Russia.

325
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:23,060
Their laws currently are on the more like, if we want to get you, we got you kind of side of the justice thing.

326
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,430
Defamation might be handled differently.

327
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:28,458
Could be.

328
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:34,398
So the Russians alex has been monitoring how the news reports are going there naturally, and they are not happy.

329
00:19:34,484 --> 00:19:37,350
Okay, well, why would they be? They looked at the national Russian news.

330
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,070
They're hopping mad at Putin.

331
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:47,730
They're pissed that a suburb can be bombed and that this journalist and talk show host, his daughter was also very prominent.

332
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,126
Boogie.

333
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:57,550
I guess in Russia, they add an A when the last name is feminine.

334
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:03,038
The father, igiana, is the blown up daughter.

335
00:20:03,074 --> 00:20:04,130
And wild.

336
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:07,546
They're saying Alexander doesn't blow his daughter up.

337
00:20:07,728 --> 00:20:08,966
And no proof.

338
00:20:09,158 --> 00:20:12,780
But that's okay because they're mainstream media.

339
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,600
The truth is, you're allowed to question anyone you want.

340
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,614
You can say it's odor and debt if you want.

341
00:20:17,652 --> 00:20:18,718
Maybe you're wrong, maybe you're right.

342
00:20:18,744 --> 00:20:20,542
The point is that you have a right to question.

343
00:20:20,616 --> 00:20:22,260
They have a right to put this out.

344
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,478
They're just saying you don't have a right to question.

345
00:20:24,564 --> 00:20:25,114
They're right back.

346
00:20:25,152 --> 00:20:26,040
Stay with us.

347
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:29,350
Alex seems to be making this about himself a little bit.

348
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:35,390
I was going to say that the number one thing that I should have expected was that this is about Alex.

349
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:42,082
And somehow, like so many of our listeners, I was like, I wonder what Alex's thoughts on this are.

350
00:20:42,156 --> 00:20:43,920
No, I knew what they were.

351
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,210
Alex was right about everything.

352
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,734
It's strange, too, because Alex is the victim.

353
00:20:48,782 --> 00:20:49,030
Yeah.

354
00:20:49,080 --> 00:21:00,398
Because really, the actual bombing seems like something Alex could use to be like, nationalists are under attack everywhere.

355
00:21:00,554 --> 00:21:02,518
It's a sweet spot for it right there.

356
00:21:02,604 --> 00:21:06,566
But instead, it's about the media coverage because he can relate it to himself.

357
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:07,426
I know.

358
00:21:07,548 --> 00:21:08,194
Very.

359
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:09,362
It is sad.

360
00:21:09,446 --> 00:21:10,574
Yeah, it is sad.

361
00:21:10,622 --> 00:21:13,294
Whenever he feels defensive, it always comes back to him.

362
00:21:13,332 --> 00:21:15,790
He's got material to work with on this.

363
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,538
And therapy.

364
00:21:16,634 --> 00:21:18,720
Well, he's definitely got that to work through.

365
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:26,782
I think that mental illness works in a certain way and sort of behavioral patterns and issues.

366
00:21:26,856 --> 00:21:33,118
And once you become sort of beholden to them and they control you, things become a little less interesting.

367
00:21:33,204 --> 00:21:37,080
And Alex's Narcissism is definitely taken over.

368
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:38,254
Yeah.

369
00:21:38,292 --> 00:21:47,078
So speaking of that Narcissism, but he was clearly the target because he's the populist of Russia.

370
00:21:47,114 --> 00:21:48,758
He's the Alex Jones of Russia.

371
00:21:48,854 --> 00:21:51,180
And mainstream news has said that over the years.

372
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:57,790
I'm sorry, what? Russia? The populist the popular talk show host that has, like, half the country tuning into him.

373
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,730
He's dead.

374
00:21:58,850 --> 00:21:59,846
His daughter is dead.

375
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:01,690
They want to make sure he dies.

376
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:05,302
The globalists have the motive to kill him.

377
00:22:05,436 --> 00:22:06,910
Do they? No.

378
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,034
Alex is describing himself once again.

379
00:22:09,072 --> 00:22:13,442
The globalist wants to kill me through Alexander Dugan.

380
00:22:13,586 --> 00:22:20,702
Not only is he like Alexander Dugan is a target, but it is also that Alex is a target through Alexander Dugan.

381
00:22:20,726 --> 00:22:26,940
And in fact, the globalists were trying to send Alex a message that anyone can be got, I believe.

382
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:34,140
Why would the globalists and Alex's conception have the motive to do this? It doesn't make sense.

383
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:38,950
Obviously they don't want Russia in Ukraine.

384
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,014
No.

385
00:22:41,112 --> 00:22:41,698
Okay.

386
00:22:41,844 --> 00:22:45,350
They want the Ukraine to join NATO.

387
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:46,020
Sure.

388
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:52,394
They want even Russia out of Crimea, out of the dawn boss.

389
00:22:52,442 --> 00:22:53,822
They want to get rid of Putin entirely.

390
00:22:53,846 --> 00:22:54,950
They want to be assassinated.

391
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:55,342
Yes.

392
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:56,170
The whole thing.

393
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:10,740
So do you think that working towards that end, do you think it's progressed by bombing someone who's seen as an associate of his? Right? Is it something that we're Putin like, oh, shit is too hot now? Sure.

394
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,802
Maybe it's a dry run.

395
00:23:12,876 --> 00:23:15,710
Maybe they're checking their oceans.

396
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,378
Eleven in practice.

397
00:23:17,474 --> 00:23:19,678
I don't see how can we car bomb anybody.

398
00:23:19,764 --> 00:23:25,270
Like, how do we carbomb you know, I think that's now I'm going to throw this one out.

399
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,154
That's a tough one, to throw, this one out at you.

400
00:23:27,192 --> 00:23:32,174
And I feel like a lot of people are going to laugh at me, but I'm going to have to go with IRA.

401
00:23:32,282 --> 00:23:35,734
They have a proven track record of this type of thing.

402
00:23:35,772 --> 00:23:36,890
Talking about steak knife.

403
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:41,834
I'm just saying that it's in their wheelhouse and maybe they just got a little bit bored.

404
00:23:41,942 --> 00:23:43,910
The troubles haven't been as hot lately.

405
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,830
Well, according to Alex, that's all the globalists.

406
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,210
That's right.

407
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,098
Damn it.

408
00:23:50,244 --> 00:23:52,754
So they hired IRA Mercks.

409
00:23:52,922 --> 00:23:54,250
Now it all makes sense.

410
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,606
Now it's all coming together.

411
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:59,674
I guess when your explanations are hyper simple, they always fit.

412
00:23:59,712 --> 00:24:00,490
They do.

413
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,438
They do.

414
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:04,690
So, look, this is not a false flag, and Alex explains why.

415
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:10,498
Okay? And you could say maybe Putin did this because he knows Dugan is a big nationalist to get Russians behind the war.

416
00:24:10,584 --> 00:24:13,930
Except if, you know, the climate in Russia, they're angry.

417
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:17,086
The average Russian in the polls, like 90%.

418
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:28,798
Putin isn't doing more in Ukraine, and that's why the population there pushed Putin into responding to the NATO proxy war that has been going on for almost nine years.

419
00:24:28,944 --> 00:24:30,362
That George Soros brags.

420
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,466
He helped orchestrate.

421
00:24:31,538 --> 00:24:40,402
Isn't that actually an argument for why Putin could have done it? Yeah, because then he would have a pretext to do the thing that the people want him to do.

422
00:24:40,476 --> 00:24:41,760
Right? Yeah.

423
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:54,038
Blames it on Ukrainian actors, ukrainian terrorists? Well, then guess what? Right? Alex is convoluted here.

424
00:24:54,064 --> 00:24:55,240
This makes no sense.

425
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,026
This is the problem.

426
00:24:57,088 --> 00:25:08,234
Because just yesterday on our last episode, we're talking about Alex saying, I pig headedly, did something precisely because other people told me not to do it.

427
00:25:08,272 --> 00:25:14,610
And we're seeing an example of him just being like, I'm not going to call it a false flag because they called it a false flag.

428
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:17,558
How about that, dick wad? Well, it's not fair.

429
00:25:17,644 --> 00:25:23,390
And doing it would require calling it a false flag would require him to say that Putin is willing to do something like that.

430
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:23,870
Sure.

431
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,594
And then he'd have to admit that Putin has done something like that.

432
00:25:26,632 --> 00:25:31,634
Well, while he was saying that Putin wasn't going to invade Ukraine right.

433
00:25:31,672 --> 00:25:36,498
Before Putin invaded Ukraine, right? Alex was saying that Russia never does false flags.

434
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:36,806
Exact.

435
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:37,406
Not once.

436
00:25:37,468 --> 00:25:38,078
It's true.

437
00:25:38,164 --> 00:25:40,142
So he can't go back on that.

438
00:25:40,276 --> 00:25:42,566
Yeah, but that's your moment.

439
00:25:42,628 --> 00:25:47,466
That's your moment to really pull it out and be like, surprise, this is the first Russian false flag.

440
00:25:47,538 --> 00:25:47,946
Nah.

441
00:25:48,018 --> 00:25:51,614
Okay, so maybe it's a false flag, maybe it's not.

442
00:25:51,652 --> 00:25:55,838
Who knows? But sure, everybody should be able to ask questions, but he's not.

443
00:25:55,864 --> 00:25:57,350
I just say this briefly.

444
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,740
We're going to come back and talk about this more.

445
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:08,958
I don't think this is a false flag, but the CIA had things like Operation Northwoods, where CIA operatives and their families would get on the plane with one telember.

446
00:26:09,054 --> 00:26:11,106
They'd blow up another plane with the same telember.

447
00:26:11,178 --> 00:26:16,326
Those families would all just change their names and use that as a pretext to go to war with Cuba and then Russia.

448
00:26:16,398 --> 00:26:16,886
Sure.

449
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:18,234
Look up Operation Northwood.

450
00:26:18,282 --> 00:26:18,854
ABC News.

451
00:26:18,892 --> 00:26:19,358
NBC News.

452
00:26:19,384 --> 00:26:20,126
They've all covered it.

453
00:26:20,188 --> 00:26:21,246
So these things exist.

454
00:26:21,318 --> 00:26:26,920
Did he stage the dentist? Elder? Is she still alive? Did she change her name? I'm sorry, what? I think that's the case.

455
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:32,970
But you have a right to say that and you have a right to speculate.

456
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:38,630
And that's with all these lawsuits against Infowars, everybody you're about is silencing that discussion.

457
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,790
Robert Barnes is coming up to cover the water.

458
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,306
No.

459
00:26:41,428 --> 00:26:42,410
Good Lord.

460
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:43,826
Yes.

461
00:26:43,948 --> 00:26:45,350
Real disappointing end.

462
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:49,420
But this is evidence that that is true.

463
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:52,658
Alex is describing a true thing.

464
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:55,166
You can question this exact thing.

465
00:26:55,288 --> 00:27:00,434
That is the evidence that we are experiencing is that The Telegraph did question this thing.

466
00:27:00,532 --> 00:27:01,998
So you are not being sued.

467
00:27:02,034 --> 00:27:08,130
Thus, we can concretely prove that it is not for this reason that Alex is being sued.

468
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:14,730
cares.

469
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:16,710
Yeah.

470
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,746
If she did fake her death, that would be an interesting conspiracy.

471
00:27:20,878 --> 00:27:21,560
Yeah.

472
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:28,542
I look forward to Alex bringing that out around the midterms to distract from something.

473
00:27:28,616 --> 00:27:36,406
Maybe she just wanted emancipation from her dad, but she couldn't get it in Russia because he's too closely connected to Putin.

474
00:27:36,478 --> 00:27:37,338
Now she's free.

475
00:27:37,424 --> 00:27:38,454
That could be, I think.

476
00:27:38,492 --> 00:27:48,142
So we have one last clip here from the 21st on Sunday, as Alex said, Bobby Barr we're not doing Bobby Barr meeting roll solo.

477
00:27:48,286 --> 00:27:49,590
Alex leaves.

478
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,886
Alex is just in for, like, the first segment or two of the show.

479
00:27:53,948 --> 00:27:54,462
Great.

480
00:27:54,596 --> 00:27:58,458
But he explains a little bit about his bankruptcy here, and I think this is pretty interesting.

481
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:01,040
All right, but let me talk about the lawsuits against us.

482
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,670
There are dozens of types of bankruptcy.

483
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:12,030
We've done chapter five, which is reorganization survival for a business so the business can continue on and, quote, pay its debts.

484
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:16,160
In the last few hearings, this is going to be coming out.

485
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:29,610
They have the plaintiff lawyers and soros'lawyers with a big law firm out of Houston in the meetings saying, we want it seized and shut down.

486
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,690
We don't want the money.

487
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:37,878
And of course, federal law says the judge is supposed to keep it going, quote, for the creditors, but they don't want money from Judge but you understand, and we knew they'd do that.

488
00:28:37,904 --> 00:28:39,426
We're showing that right now.

489
00:28:39,608 --> 00:28:51,846
That's why as long as we have solvent numbers to pay the employees, keep the lights on, and run the operation, the federal judge will look at that for a year and then say, okay, over the next five years, here's what you can pay, and that's what they get.

490
00:28:51,908 --> 00:28:53,120
And we stay on air.

491
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:55,678
Federal courts already seen my books.

492
00:28:55,714 --> 00:28:57,246
They know I haven't paid myself in a year and a half.

493
00:28:57,308 --> 00:28:57,582
I know.

494
00:28:57,596 --> 00:29:01,678
I've injected $10 million, everything I got into this operation, all the emergency savings.

495
00:29:01,714 --> 00:29:10,398
Have they seen your real books? And the court's eyes are getting real big right now in these meetings where they're like, we want them shut down.

496
00:29:10,544 --> 00:29:12,238
No, we don't want money for electricity.

497
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:13,102
We want it closed.

498
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,242
They're like, what? You're creditors.

499
00:29:14,326 --> 00:29:18,850
Don't you want money for the plaintiffs? The families are nothing but puppets.

500
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,518
They're using and controlling.

501
00:29:20,614 --> 00:29:25,966
I'm sorry, but that's what this is all about.

502
00:29:26,028 --> 00:29:31,006
And they will not silence us if you simply buy the products@infowarstore.com.

503
00:29:31,068 --> 00:29:31,366
Wow.

504
00:29:31,428 --> 00:29:33,218
So that might be a new definition.

505
00:29:33,374 --> 00:29:41,218
I mean, how do you not play that in the we need to shut them down hearing? Part of, like, hey, this is never going to stop.

506
00:29:41,304 --> 00:29:42,574
This is just never going to stop.

507
00:29:42,612 --> 00:29:43,174
Listen to this.

508
00:29:43,212 --> 00:29:44,198
This was yesterday.

509
00:29:44,294 --> 00:29:46,594
Guess what I'm going to call it now.

510
00:29:46,632 --> 00:29:53,342
I'm going to call my shot within the next week, I will have another clip for you of him breaking these rules.

511
00:29:53,426 --> 00:29:54,106
I'm calling it.

512
00:29:54,108 --> 00:29:56,230
I'm pointing to the left field fence, man.

513
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,602
Maybe by the end of his episode.

514
00:29:57,686 --> 00:29:58,320
Exactly.

515
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,334
So I don't know everything about.

516
00:30:00,372 --> 00:30:01,210
Bankruptcy law.

517
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:05,402
But from everything I can tell, this is not a plan that's going to work for Alex.

518
00:30:05,546 --> 00:30:11,294
For one thing, Chapter Five is only available to businesses that have less than $7.5 million in debt.

519
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:17,530
And if he's trying to bankrupt Free Speech Systems, they owe like $50 million to Alex's dad's shell company.

520
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:22,042
And the judgment in the Sandy Hook case, the first one exceeded that amount already.

521
00:30:22,236 --> 00:30:30,290
Additionally, this debt limit only applies if 50% or more of the company's debt is business related, which doesn't include defamation judgments.

522
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:39,538
Also, the only reason that the cap is 7.5 million as opposed to the original limit that this subchapter had, the original limit was 2.75 million.

523
00:30:39,624 --> 00:30:43,670
The only reason that's different is because of the Cares Act, which Alex was staunchly.

524
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:50,522
Again, of course, Chapter Five is a sub chapter of Chapter Eleven bankruptcy or the reorganization bankruptcy.

525
00:30:50,666 --> 00:31:00,098
It seems pretty clear to me why Alex chose this route, and it's because Chapter Five bankruptcy cases specifically do not require a business to file a full disclosure statement to the court.

526
00:31:00,134 --> 00:31:01,030
Well, that would make sense.

527
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:01,366
Yeah.

528
00:31:01,428 --> 00:31:03,730
Let's choose the one that lets us hide our lives.

529
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,222
Yes.

530
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:21,326
Because the thing is that Chapter Five, it was created because Chapter Eleven normal bankruptcies require all kinds of information and small businesses were what Chapter Five was made for.

531
00:31:21,388 --> 00:31:21,686
Sure.

532
00:31:21,748 --> 00:31:27,198
And they were in a position that usually are illequipped to handle the intricacies of a normal reorganization.

533
00:31:27,354 --> 00:31:35,750
Under Chapter Eleven, part of their debt is that they can't afford an incredibly expensive accountant to help them actually do the stuff that they're supposed to do.

534
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,194
Yeah.

535
00:31:36,292 --> 00:31:44,342
Too often, small businesses weren't able to take advantage of what they could get with a Chapter Eleven reorganization and they just end up going out of business.

536
00:31:44,416 --> 00:31:47,838
So this was an attempt to provide an option for them to stay afloat.

537
00:31:47,874 --> 00:31:48,254
Right.

538
00:31:48,352 --> 00:31:56,742
Alex is basically attempting to abuse the bankruptcy system, and while he's doing it, he's using the illusion of his persecution to sell his dumb products to the audience.

539
00:31:56,886 --> 00:31:59,498
The good news is that he probably doesn't qualify for Chapter Five.

540
00:31:59,524 --> 00:32:01,598
And as this progresses through the court, we'll see what happens.

541
00:32:01,684 --> 00:32:06,734
But I don't think that based on what I can find, I don't think that this is going to work.

542
00:32:06,772 --> 00:32:20,454
I mean, sometimes I really do think I understand that the court system does work slow and needs to, but god damn it, for this case, I really feel like every day you should go and you should play the judge a clip and be like, see, this option is off the table.

543
00:32:20,562 --> 00:32:21,470
That he said it.

544
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:21,806
Right.

545
00:32:21,868 --> 00:32:22,274
Done.

546
00:32:22,372 --> 00:32:22,742
Okay.

547
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:27,374
Then tomorrow you bring in a clip like, we should have this whole thing banged out in like a week.

548
00:32:27,472 --> 00:32:34,362
Well, actually, the Chapter Five subsection or subchapter is designed to be faster.

549
00:32:34,446 --> 00:32:34,766
Right.

550
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:36,194
So there is that.

551
00:32:36,232 --> 00:32:38,010
There is that at least they'll go faster.

552
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:38,366
Right.

553
00:32:38,428 --> 00:32:40,586
How many chapters are there is a question.

554
00:32:40,648 --> 00:32:41,310
I guarantee.

555
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:43,142
Alex is asked and then asked.

556
00:32:43,276 --> 00:32:46,742
Can we just keep using them? Can I write? Yeah.

557
00:32:46,876 --> 00:32:50,066
How about another chapter? So we get to the 22nd.

558
00:32:50,128 --> 00:32:51,314
We get to Monday show? Okay.

559
00:32:51,352 --> 00:32:58,098
Because I felt like, well, we have not really even scratched the surface of the Dugan attempt.

560
00:32:58,134 --> 00:33:02,486
No, we've scratched Alex's surface a little, but he's got to have more to say.

561
00:33:02,548 --> 00:33:03,050
You would hope.

562
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,310
There's big news coming today.

563
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,006
Okay.

564
00:33:05,188 --> 00:33:08,166
Big broadcast ahead of Ointroyer 03:00 PM central.

565
00:33:08,238 --> 00:33:10,480
Always informative on the war room.

566
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:17,214
All right, when we come back still long time to break.

567
00:33:17,252 --> 00:33:18,366
When we come back.

568
00:33:18,548 --> 00:33:22,122
We don't just put out his most important tweet yet.

569
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:29,520
no.

570
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,098
Can't handle it.

571
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:33,406
I gotta go.

572
00:33:33,588 --> 00:33:34,642
Oh, good.

573
00:33:34,776 --> 00:33:40,500
You know what it's like to turn on a show and hear that? I do now.

574
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:43,834
Okay.

575
00:33:43,932 --> 00:33:44,700
All right.

576
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:46,946
Let's call the dad.

577
00:33:47,018 --> 00:33:52,654
It's one thing if you're pretending to be like TMZ and this is your lead right.

578
00:33:52,812 --> 00:33:55,174
Then, hey, that's what you are.

579
00:33:55,272 --> 00:33:56,462
You're a clickbait.

580
00:33:56,606 --> 00:33:59,698
Top 43 tweets by Elon Musk And this is today.

581
00:33:59,784 --> 00:34:00,742
Yeah, whatever.

582
00:34:00,936 --> 00:34:04,438
Tends to be like, I'm the most geopolitically important person in the world.

583
00:34:04,524 --> 00:34:05,400
Oh, man.

584
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:07,234
World leaders, listen to me.

585
00:34:07,272 --> 00:34:07,438
Oh.

586
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:09,190
Elon Musk had a good tweet.

587
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,350
Can you think of Edward R.

588
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:19,118
Murrow being like, oh, the Rockefellers put out a chalk drawing on the sidewalk.

589
00:34:19,154 --> 00:34:22,020
Like, what are you talking about? Something pithy at a bar.

590
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,654
Alex is the Algonquin round table of his time.

591
00:34:25,692 --> 00:34:26,640
That is true.

592
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:28,882
So there's a lot of news.

593
00:34:28,956 --> 00:34:29,580
Sure.

594
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:31,390
Not just the tweet.

595
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:41,218
We have the execution assassination of Alexander Dugan's daughter when they were trying to kill him.

596
00:34:41,244 --> 00:34:49,162
What that really signifies massive economy is so much on the great reset and more today.

597
00:34:49,236 --> 00:34:50,306
This is another broadcast.

598
00:34:50,378 --> 00:34:51,490
Busy day I don't want to miss.

599
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,206
But separately, here is the good news.

600
00:34:53,268 --> 00:34:54,610
Freedom is popular.

601
00:34:55,170 --> 00:35:00,754
This book, with no advertising in the corporate media, has gone to number five.

602
00:35:00,912 --> 00:35:08,002
It fluctuates between that and the top 100 on Amazon.com, the number one book platform in the world.

603
00:35:08,076 --> 00:35:10,990
It's the equivalent of the New York Times bestseller list before they got caught.

604
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:11,882
Rigging.

605
00:35:11,906 --> 00:35:14,306
In the last 20 years, nobody looks at or believes it anymore.

606
00:35:14,318 --> 00:35:14,978
It's totally fake.

607
00:35:15,014 --> 00:35:17,160
The Amazon chart is 100% real.

608
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:22,540
Off and off, several weeks, and you see, this is the actual book.

609
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:26,694
It is here it is ready to ship, ladies and gentlemen.

610
00:35:26,742 --> 00:35:34,718
And I can tell you that there are a few thousand books left at Info Worldstore.com until a new order comes in.

611
00:35:34,744 --> 00:35:38,558
But for the time being, this will be the only sign books I do.

612
00:35:38,584 --> 00:35:40,286
And it's a fundraiser to keep us on air.

613
00:35:40,408 --> 00:35:41,442
It's absolutely critical.

614
00:35:41,466 --> 00:35:45,842
I want to thank all of you that went and got the signed fundraiser copy of the book.

615
00:35:45,976 --> 00:35:46,886
It's a piece of history.

616
00:35:46,948 --> 00:35:48,110
It's the Death Star plan.

617
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:53,234
The great reset in the war for the world is your last chance to get a signed copy at Info orstore.com.

618
00:35:53,332 --> 00:35:54,674
And it is a fundraiser we're doing.

619
00:35:54,712 --> 00:35:55,850
So thank you so much.

620
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,486
Your support.

621
00:35:56,548 --> 00:36:00,342
The great reset of the world is my magnum opus.

622
00:36:00,486 --> 00:36:05,466
It is a masterwork wild, just absolutely devastatingly.

623
00:36:05,598 --> 00:36:07,970
Lays out how evil and sick these people are.

624
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:19,346
What about reset wars? Let me ask you a bigger and greater question, all right? In the book, how does he spell evil? I have two things I want to bring up about this.

625
00:36:19,408 --> 00:36:19,742
Okay.

626
00:36:19,816 --> 00:36:20,966
The first thing yes.

627
00:36:21,028 --> 00:36:23,642
Is that man, he's making bezos a lot of money.

628
00:36:23,716 --> 00:36:24,830
He sure is.

629
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,426
I hope he's happy about that.

630
00:36:26,488 --> 00:36:27,950
Hey, the Amazon charts are real.

631
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,262
At least like the lies of The New York Times.

632
00:36:31,336 --> 00:36:31,960
Yeah.

633
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:35,850
And then the second thing I was thinking about, he's not going to sign all these books.

634
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:39,174
No, but if he does, he's going to be drinking.

635
00:36:39,222 --> 00:36:45,040
While he doesn't want to get progressively floppy as he goes along.

636
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:49,118
We need that flow chart to really show up.

637
00:36:49,144 --> 00:36:49,442
Yeah.

638
00:36:49,516 --> 00:36:51,782
I want the last book.

639
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:54,160
This is going to be a black page.

640
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:59,546
I kind of want to know, did someone edit it? That's what I want to know.

641
00:36:59,608 --> 00:37:04,694
Yeah, but here's what I'm talking about, right? He didn't even write it.

642
00:37:04,792 --> 00:37:07,298
He didn't write it according to what he said about it.

643
00:37:07,324 --> 00:37:07,766
Right? Yeah.

644
00:37:07,828 --> 00:37:09,510
He dictated it, supposedly.

645
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:11,486
Or grabbed from his show.

646
00:37:11,548 --> 00:37:12,062
Right.

647
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:13,722
Not even necessarily dictated.

648
00:37:13,806 --> 00:37:15,894
Just people transcribed his ramp.

649
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:16,514
Right.

650
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:19,806
But they cut out the rambling.

651
00:37:19,878 --> 00:37:20,186
Right.

652
00:37:20,248 --> 00:37:24,446
There's no way that it's going to go I kind of want to read it just in case.

653
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:25,454
I'm going to read it.

654
00:37:25,492 --> 00:37:27,530
It doesn't come out until the 30th.

655
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,898
Well, it's already rocketed to the top of the charts.

656
00:37:29,994 --> 00:37:30,626
The best.

657
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:39,498
Kind of like how Alex's War was at the top of the charts and then no one cared, but at least that was true whenever nobody cared.

658
00:37:39,654 --> 00:37:40,046
Yeah.

659
00:37:40,108 --> 00:37:41,018
Not even the New York Times.

660
00:37:41,044 --> 00:37:45,530
I'm going to guess no one's going to care when Alex's book comes out, but we will definitely copy.

661
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:47,246
Come on.

662
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:51,770
And you know what I was thinking about doing? I was thinking about doing a Great Reset special.

663
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:54,774
So what I would do is I would take Alex's book the great reset.

664
00:37:54,822 --> 00:37:55,178
Sure.

665
00:37:55,264 --> 00:37:59,142
Compare it to Klau Schwab's book the Great reset where it counts.

666
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:01,290
Glenn Beck's book the Great reset.

667
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:02,142
That's trouble.

668
00:38:02,226 --> 00:38:06,654
Try and see where we're at with the three of them, where there's overlaps.

669
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:07,058
Sure.

670
00:38:07,144 --> 00:38:11,020
Who's making up what? Here's what I say we do.

671
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:26,090
First off, what we're going to do is we're going to cut out little passages from each book and then glue them together and then take that message and mail it to Alex so it sounds like we're holding one of his children hostage.

672
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:29,034
See? We're holding the ecosystem.

673
00:38:29,082 --> 00:38:30,040
Yeah, exactly.

674
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:33,386
If you don't reset, we'll come get you.

675
00:38:33,508 --> 00:38:36,494
So look, the big news yeah.

676
00:38:36,652 --> 00:38:37,566
Musk.

677
00:38:37,758 --> 00:38:38,726
Biggest tweet ever.

678
00:38:38,788 --> 00:38:39,290
It's big.

679
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:39,938
Most important.

680
00:38:40,024 --> 00:38:47,030
I know for a fact, and I told you this a couple of years ago, that Elon Musk was riding the fence and that he decided to fight the New World Order.

681
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:55,010
At least he told his top advisors that and said he was going for a pro human future to fight the New World Order.

682
00:38:55,060 --> 00:39:00,710
Now, whether he's being legitimate or not, christ says you judge a tree by its fruits.

683
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,522
Look what Elon tweeted out yesterday.

684
00:39:03,606 --> 00:39:06,830
Got hundreds of thousands of retweets elon Musk.

685
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,530
There's the actual image.

686
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:14,570
Please let me use the CERN large hadron collider.

687
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:21,940
I'm normal and can be trusted with the demonic technology unlike anything the world has ever seen.

688
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:32,122
What is a demonic technology? Well, they admit they're trying to find the God particle.

689
00:39:32,206 --> 00:39:32,960
All right.

690
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:45,766
They admit they're trying to create artificial black holes and strangelets that create particles so strong, sinks the center of the Earth, and then creates a black hole that implodes the entire planet.

691
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:47,098
It's not a Star Trek movie.

692
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,214
It's reality.

693
00:39:48,322 --> 00:39:50,146
So this is not an important tweet.

694
00:39:50,278 --> 00:39:52,906
It's basically musk shit posting.

695
00:39:53,098 --> 00:39:56,518
Also, CERN isn't trying to create a black hole to implode the universe.

696
00:39:56,614 --> 00:40:03,274
And they found confirmation of the existence of the Higgs Boson, aka the God Particle, ten years ago in 2013.

697
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:04,386
Decade ago.

698
00:40:04,508 --> 00:40:05,466
It's old.

699
00:40:05,648 --> 00:40:07,830
God particle was a great day.

700
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,794
I was really excited.

701
00:40:08,842 --> 00:40:10,102
I watched the live stream.

702
00:40:10,126 --> 00:40:11,226
It was really cool.

703
00:40:11,288 --> 00:40:11,586
Yeah.

704
00:40:11,648 --> 00:40:25,558
Alex has not updated his talking points in quite a while, so you know what else Christ said of people similar to Elod Bus? He was like, you know, it's easier for a rich guy to go through heaven.

705
00:40:25,654 --> 00:40:26,946
That it's awesome.

706
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:28,254
Rich people are the best.

707
00:40:28,352 --> 00:40:29,578
Come on in, buddies.

708
00:40:29,674 --> 00:40:34,726
I will make the head of the needle really large, and he promises to have tons of white babies.

709
00:40:34,918 --> 00:40:37,402
He opened the large hadron collider.

710
00:40:37,546 --> 00:40:39,558
Jesus words are different now.

711
00:40:39,644 --> 00:40:40,470
Oh, no.

712
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,706
Mandela Effect.

713
00:40:41,768 --> 00:40:44,060
Yes, the Bible is entirely different.

714
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,614
That's a Mandela effect.

715
00:40:46,712 --> 00:40:48,620
Is that a movie? I hope so.

716
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:52,230
Wait, isn't that knowing? No.

717
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:52,530
Okay.

718
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,466
Quite different.

719
00:40:53,648 --> 00:40:56,086
So, look, CERN dangerous.

720
00:40:56,278 --> 00:40:58,938
It blew up a few years ago, the last time they tried it.

721
00:40:58,964 --> 00:41:11,770
Now they're doing I'm sorry, what test again? You didn't hear it? While they're doing the test, they're constantly doing satanic rituals above ground, on facilities, acreage.

722
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:13,974
So they had a helium leak in 2008.

723
00:41:14,012 --> 00:41:15,140
I was going to say.

724
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:19,160
I just don't understand how we could get to blow up.

725
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:29,778
wild.

726
00:41:29,874 --> 00:41:30,494
Yeah.

727
00:41:30,652 --> 00:41:32,258
They are doing satanic rituals, though.

728
00:41:32,284 --> 00:41:33,314
Alex is right on about it.

729
00:41:33,352 --> 00:41:35,042
Sure, but that's why it doesn't blow up.

730
00:41:35,056 --> 00:41:38,010
The satanic rituals keep it stable.

731
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:40,382
Otherwise you can't shoot particles that fast.

732
00:41:40,576 --> 00:41:44,750
With great ritual comes great particles.

733
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:48,498
Winners.

734
00:41:48,654 --> 00:41:49,550
When I say things.

735
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,042
Hey, listen, we can't all hit it to the left field sense.

736
00:41:53,116 --> 00:41:54,280
So there's big news.

737
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,270
My man Fauche.

738
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:57,602
Dr.

739
00:41:57,676 --> 00:41:58,326
Faustus.

740
00:41:58,398 --> 00:41:59,020
Yeah.

741
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:01,446
He has decided to resign.

742
00:42:01,518 --> 00:42:02,114
Good for him.

743
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:03,280
All right, here it is.

744
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:05,666
Dr.

745
00:42:05,728 --> 00:42:16,470
Fauchy has issued his resignation letter after 40 plus years running different federal agencies, murdering people walking treatments engaged in HIV.

746
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:18,170
Rollout the lab.

747
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:36,150
This murderous discredited monster, this Hitler 2.0, this Bill Gates prosthesis what that's now designed.

748
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:55,630
What does that one mean? I'm announcing today that I am stepping down the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief of NIAD Laboratory of Immunologization, as well as the position of chief medical Advisor to President Joe Biden.

749
00:42:55,810 --> 00:43:00,394
I will be leaving these positions in December of this year to pursue the next chapter.

750
00:43:00,442 --> 00:43:01,880
Getting to my Arnold now.

751
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:10,860
He now wants everybody to take polio shots again.

752
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:15,190
That impression was so inconsistent.

753
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:17,662
That was all over the place.

754
00:43:17,856 --> 00:43:27,538
I got what name? How many do we get? But it was also like shifting midsentence, right? He was trying to find his bearings and he didn't get there.

755
00:43:27,564 --> 00:43:28,618
He never found it.

756
00:43:28,764 --> 00:43:35,280
That's depressing from one of the greatest voice actors of our time, who was offered the role of Optimist Prime? Everything.

757
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:40,058
But then he criticized Obama, and they said they couldn't let him be starlord.

758
00:43:40,094 --> 00:43:41,906
If you criticize Obama, that's science.

759
00:43:41,978 --> 00:43:46,178
Also, the CDC still recommends children get vaccinated against polio forever.

760
00:43:46,334 --> 00:43:51,338
Number of people who don't take that advice, and most likely due to low vaccination rates in some areas.

761
00:43:51,374 --> 00:43:56,098
We recently saw the identification of a case of polio in Rockland County, New York.

762
00:43:56,244 --> 00:44:02,698
Experts believe that if they're seeing one case, there is a very high likelihood that there are more people who have caught it in the area.

763
00:44:02,844 --> 00:44:06,230
But maybe asymptomatic, which is a terrifying prospect.

764
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:12,730
The US has a vaccination rate for polio of 93%, whereas Rockland County is at about 60%.

765
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:18,670
Anyway, this is not good and probably won't be the last we hear of this story, but let's hope for the best.

766
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,202
Jesus.

767
00:44:19,286 --> 00:44:27,038
Alex is ready to handle the news of a possible resurgence of polio, though, since he'll just say that it's secretly covet vaccine side effects being called polio.

768
00:44:27,134 --> 00:44:31,970
And then he'll fleece his audience, selling them survival food as he watches them get sick and die.

769
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:35,894
This is kind of what his business model has largely evolved into after Covet.

770
00:44:35,942 --> 00:44:39,826
Yeah, and I don't even have to just speculate on that.

771
00:44:40,008 --> 00:44:46,070
We told you that Climate was polio when you got paralysis from the poison shots.

772
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:49,140
And the record levels of heart attacks will be detailed next hour.

773
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:51,480
He's already ready.

774
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:58,394
I think the number one thing I applaud Faucey for is retiring with dignity.

775
00:44:58,502 --> 00:45:05,174
Because I'll be goddamned if I didn't quit that job with the single largest fuck you to America.

776
00:45:05,222 --> 00:45:14,830
Anybody's ever like nobody has earned the right to give the double bird on TV to the entire United States of America more than Fuchi.

777
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:20,806
He might have a scathing book in the future.

778
00:45:20,928 --> 00:45:21,526
Give up.

779
00:45:21,588 --> 00:45:23,086
That's the name of Fuchi's book.

780
00:45:23,148 --> 00:45:24,190
Give up on hope.

781
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:24,862
Yeah.

782
00:45:24,996 --> 00:45:29,578
So we get to the second hour of the program and Alex isn't there.

783
00:45:29,604 --> 00:45:35,626
For the first break, they just play special reports, which happens from time to time it's not on the radio, right? Who gives a shit? Yeah.

784
00:45:35,808 --> 00:45:42,746
Second segment starts and I noticed that it seemed that Infowars had switched to an instrumental jazz format.

785
00:45:42,818 --> 00:45:43,440
Interesting.

786
00:45:51,850 --> 00:46:00,280
And now the works of Antonio Carlos Chopin the most dangerous fact ever created by man.

787
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:21,462
I was as confused as I've ever been.

788
00:46:21,536 --> 00:46:23,360
It goes on for a long time.

789
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:25,940
Let's listen to all of it.

790
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:28,206
I don't know what was going on there.

791
00:46:28,268 --> 00:46:30,046
There's some sort of a technical difficulty.

792
00:46:30,118 --> 00:46:31,978
But this is the feed that goes out on the radio.

793
00:46:32,014 --> 00:46:33,430
Yeah, let's all go to the lobby.

794
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:36,634
Started playing elevator music on Info.

795
00:46:36,742 --> 00:46:37,580
Yeah, great.

796
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:45,394
So I don't know what the fuck was happening, but Steve Kersh is on Alex's antivaxx substance buddy.

797
00:46:45,442 --> 00:46:47,730
Is it not addressed? No.

798
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,942
What just happened? No, I don't think Alex never notices.

799
00:46:50,026 --> 00:46:50,310
No.

800
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,130
But there are further tech difficulties.

801
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:54,222
Here we are.

802
00:46:54,296 --> 00:46:56,706
Steve Kerr joins us for the balance of the hour.

803
00:46:56,888 --> 00:46:57,774
But we do have numbers.

804
00:46:57,812 --> 00:47:00,858
We have insurance company numbers, we have government numbers, we have them all.

805
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:02,914
He has them all in his substance and layout.

806
00:47:03,022 --> 00:47:08,010
The facts that now even the CDC saying, okay, the shot doesn't help you, doesn't protect you.

807
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:16,350
All over the world, from Australia to Germany to the UK to Canada, the US, they're showing that people that affected are way more likely to actually get sick.

808
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:19,700
Please lay it out for us.

809
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:33,762
Well, it's just like I said on Fox News, and Brian Big, who was the host, was caught off guard, and so he said, well, we can't verify those numbers.

810
00:47:33,896 --> 00:47:50,478
Well, he was actually telling people the truth because Fox News has contractual commitments that don't allow them to speak poorly about the vaccine, so they can't say anything antivaxx on Fox News that's skipping that you heard is on Alex's end.

811
00:47:50,504 --> 00:47:53,050
That was not our recording.

812
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:56,074
So this is a fun semantics game that Steve is playing.

813
00:47:56,182 --> 00:48:05,526
The Fox News host, Brian Kilmead was pointing out that Steve's statistics are completely dubious and he can't prove that they're accurate and expresses that by saying, we can't confirm that.

814
00:48:05,648 --> 00:48:14,434
Steve naturally doesn't want to accept that he in fact, can't confirm any of the bullshit he spreads, so he's using the wording of this comment to create a broader conspiracy.

815
00:48:14,542 --> 00:48:16,630
Of course you can't confirm this, Brian.

816
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:27,678
Kill Mead, you're on the farm of payroll, right? If Fox hosts can't be antivaxx, I wonder what happened with Tucker Hannity and Fox and Friends sometimes.

817
00:48:27,824 --> 00:48:36,162
See, this is why we need to relax certain language requirements for TV hosts in this situation.

818
00:48:36,356 --> 00:48:42,382
You can't say, we can't confirm that what you have to say is bullshit's.

819
00:48:42,406 --> 00:48:42,870
Best interest.

820
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,502
No, and I understand that, but I feel like it should be required.

821
00:48:45,586 --> 00:48:55,674
So I'm not sure what statistics Steve is talking about here, because his substec is full of posts claiming various bombshell things about covert vaccines, and all of them apparently rely on very legitimate data.

822
00:48:55,832 --> 00:49:04,842
I decided to consult one recent post with the headline, quote, do you know how many people have been killed worldwide by their governments from the covet shots? 16,000.

823
00:49:04,916 --> 00:49:06,630
It's around 12 million.

824
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,522
That's 40 times the number of Americans who were killed in World War II.

825
00:49:10,606 --> 00:49:13,366
It's more than double the number killed by COVID.

826
00:49:13,558 --> 00:49:14,650
That seemed intriguing.

827
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:15,006
Yeah.

828
00:49:15,068 --> 00:49:18,894
How was this number reached? You're probably asking yourself that's my first question.

829
00:49:18,992 --> 00:49:20,826
Yeah, it seems like an even number.

830
00:49:20,888 --> 00:49:22,218
First off, here's how Steve got it.

831
00:49:22,244 --> 00:49:22,650
Okay.

832
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:28,642
Quote Margaret and Alice asked if anyone could estimate the global death toll from the covert shots.

833
00:49:28,786 --> 00:49:33,426
In my opinion, a reasonable estimate is to divide the number of doses by $1,000.

834
00:49:33,488 --> 00:49:38,842
If you do that for 600 million doses delivered in the United States, you do not get 600,000 deaths.

835
00:49:38,866 --> 00:49:39,958
Which is right in the ballpark.

836
00:49:39,994 --> 00:49:44,034
No, he just said it.

837
00:49:44,072 --> 00:49:45,618
Yeah, that's not data.

838
00:49:45,704 --> 00:49:48,318
That was his basis for that number.

839
00:49:48,404 --> 00:49:50,046
And then you extrapolate that out to the world.

840
00:49:50,108 --> 00:49:50,514
Right.

841
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:52,626
So I said that, and that means it's true.

842
00:49:52,688 --> 00:49:52,878
Yeah.

843
00:49:52,904 --> 00:49:57,762
This is expressing an opinion and then making a guess based on entirely nothing.

844
00:49:57,956 --> 00:50:00,142
This article is legitimately trash.

845
00:50:00,286 --> 00:50:06,270
Here's Steve synthesizing his point, which, again, is just about him guessing things based on nothing.

846
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:15,846
Quote we are killing an awful lot of people, but world leaders are looking the other way and saying nothing while all of us watch the high number of death reports in the media.

847
00:50:15,908 --> 00:50:21,802
People who died, quote, unexpectedly and hear no explanation from the medical community or the CDC.

848
00:50:21,946 --> 00:50:30,426
We're supposed to trust that they have things well in hand, even though they won't appear on camera in front of anyone who doesn't have scripted preapproved questions.

849
00:50:30,608 --> 00:50:39,930
The vaccine was never mentioned in any of these unexplained death reports, yet people all over the world have noticed that these unexpected deaths are only happening to the vaccinated.

850
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:42,140
I wonder why.

851
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:54,066
And I would say, what unexpected deaths are you talking about? There are any specifics offered in the article, so I don't know if I agree that we even are seeing a huge number of unexpected deaths reported in the media.

852
00:50:54,188 --> 00:50:57,358
You know what bums me out? Because this is really suspicious.

853
00:50:57,454 --> 00:51:03,234
Not one of these medical professionals can we even call them that? Is the first question.

854
00:51:03,332 --> 00:51:10,450
But not one of them will go on live TV in a pit filled with hungry hyenas.

855
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:11,418
Not one of them.

856
00:51:11,504 --> 00:51:17,346
Now, why not, Dan? Why not? What are they afraid of, Dan? You're right.

857
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:17,958
Exactly.

858
00:51:18,104 --> 00:51:20,010
I'm taken aback by your logic.

859
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:22,914
You can't deny it makes total sense.

860
00:51:22,952 --> 00:51:23,478
It does.

861
00:51:23,564 --> 00:51:31,078
There are occasionally, like, celebrities who die with no immediate cause of death determined, and then these antivaxx idiots rush in to pretend there was a vaccine death.

862
00:51:31,114 --> 00:51:35,398
But typically in all of those cases, a death cause is determined.

863
00:51:35,434 --> 00:51:38,382
But it's after people like Steve stopped caring about the story.

864
00:51:38,456 --> 00:51:42,714
Yeah, just use it for the immediate dopamine rush of like, hey, get this.

865
00:51:42,752 --> 00:51:44,890
This person who you love was killed by Fauchy.

866
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:45,498
Right.

867
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:51,342
It's hard to wait a couple of days to say that, though, after the people have already figured out the actual reason.

868
00:51:51,536 --> 00:51:53,274
Let me be totally clear about this.

869
00:51:53,372 --> 00:51:55,054
Steve Kersh is a lunatic.

870
00:51:55,222 --> 00:52:09,126
This article also includes this passage quote we are approaching the 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust over a period of twelve years, but we're killing people worldwide at a rate of at least six times faster than the Germans did.

871
00:52:09,248 --> 00:52:12,894
We're killing nearly close to 10,000 people every day.

872
00:52:12,992 --> 00:52:17,214
The latest rate was roughly 8.46 million doses a day.

873
00:52:17,372 --> 00:52:30,094
Interestingly, this is not self limiting because 3850 babies are born every day, so the killing can go on indefinitely, even if the birth rate drops by 90% due to the shots, in case you were wondering.

874
00:52:30,142 --> 00:52:31,866
I just thought I'd point that out.

875
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:35,950
This is complete drivel, and it's a bit offensive to boot.

876
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:45,850
I feel like we need to really hammer home that this obsession with comparing things to the Holocaust is Holocaust minimization, which is a subset of Holocaust denial.

877
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:47,422
That's the part I was saying was a bit offensive.

878
00:52:47,506 --> 00:52:48,114
Yeah.

879
00:52:48,272 --> 00:52:57,990
There's a reason that they are so focused on comparing things to the Holocaust to make it feel like the Holocaust wasn't that big a deal after all that was it? Compared to vaccinations? Yeah, exactly.

880
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:59,070
What? Yeah.

881
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:04,950
So for one thing about Steve's logic here, 10,000 people aren't being killed by the vaccine every day.

882
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:05,922
That's just shit talk.

883
00:53:05,996 --> 00:53:19,160
But beyond that, this supposed killing could not go on indefinitely, even if the birth rate dropped 90%, because the massive societal problems that would accompany that drop in birth rates would render 10,000 deaths a day a side issue.

884
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:21,534
Everything would be over.

885
00:53:21,632 --> 00:53:27,510
Yeah, I don't think just the devastation of everything daily crazy.

886
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:40,834
Speaking of statistics, on August 20, Steve posted a blog entry where he was begging people who work at hospitals to provide him with internal data about their numbers of deaths and ICU admissions based on vaccination status.

887
00:53:41,002 --> 00:53:43,534
This is probably illegal for them to divulge.

888
00:53:43,582 --> 00:53:47,674
But also, whatever results he gets from this are completely meaningless.

889
00:53:47,842 --> 00:53:55,762
He's gathering data through the equivalent of a Google survey form where anyone could just enter whatever numbers they want and pretend they work at a hospital.

890
00:53:55,846 --> 00:54:02,770
Right, but also he's sending out a Google survey form that says, Please commit a crime.

891
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:03,798
Yes or no.

892
00:54:03,944 --> 00:54:05,490
That is what he's doing.

893
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:08,938
But we're all pretending, so it doesn't really so it's not really a crime.

894
00:54:08,974 --> 00:54:09,474
I understand.

895
00:54:09,572 --> 00:54:10,690
But it's a pretend crime.

896
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:11,226
Yeah.

897
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:25,594
This data collection form is apparently something he's been using for a while, but he's just now updated it so you can enter in hospital level data before you can enter information about your family and friends or your household and how many people were hurt or killed by vaccines in that subgroup.

898
00:54:25,642 --> 00:54:25,854
Sure.

899
00:54:25,892 --> 00:54:26,634
That's nice of him.

900
00:54:26,672 --> 00:54:43,450
It's probably a fair assumption that he's been treating the responses to this as actual data as opposed to him targeting a very strongly self selected antivaxx community as potential responders to his survey and then having literally zero way to confirm any of the numbers people enter into the survey.

901
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:44,118
That's what he's doing.

902
00:54:44,144 --> 00:54:44,730
It's not data.

903
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:47,790
It's like VAERS, but in Arkham Asylum.

904
00:54:48,770 --> 00:54:49,386
Yeah.

905
00:54:49,508 --> 00:54:53,430
What would he be? What would his villain name be? I don't know.

906
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:56,382
The substance? That's not good.

907
00:54:56,456 --> 00:54:57,162
No.

908
00:54:57,356 --> 00:54:58,210
The blogger.

909
00:54:58,270 --> 00:54:58,494
No.

910
00:54:58,532 --> 00:54:59,458
That's terrible.

911
00:54:59,614 --> 00:55:02,718
So all of the information that he's putting out means exactly nothing.

912
00:55:02,804 --> 00:55:13,100
But it's the kind of thing that can be used to create an impression that something more legitimate and more scholarly than just apocryphal anecdotes that the antivax community has.

913
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:16,402
That's what they usually rely on, these anecdotal stories.

914
00:55:16,486 --> 00:55:16,890
Of course.

915
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:25,786
And this is a way that he can sort of mold those anecdotes into numbers, and it gives the appearance of it meaning something more than just a tweet.

916
00:55:25,858 --> 00:55:35,298
Well, off the top of my head, I would say that the way to treat these fairly would be to take the total number of submissions and divide it by 1000.

917
00:55:35,384 --> 00:55:37,426
And then that's the number that are accurate.

918
00:55:37,558 --> 00:55:38,034
Sure.

919
00:55:38,132 --> 00:55:39,610
Now, bottom line, this guy sucks.

920
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:39,930
Yes.

921
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:40,650
Bring back Dr.

922
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:41,230
Marbles.

923
00:55:41,290 --> 00:55:43,698
I really appreciated him over this.

924
00:55:43,844 --> 00:55:46,170
Pretty that guy was unhinged in a fun way.

925
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:46,470
Yeah.

926
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,934
They're calling for war and what.

927
00:55:47,972 --> 00:55:48,558
Little bar.

928
00:55:48,644 --> 00:55:49,278
Little bar.

929
00:55:49,364 --> 00:55:49,794
Yeah.

930
00:55:49,892 --> 00:55:50,554
Steve sucks.

931
00:55:50,602 --> 00:55:51,200
Yeah.

932
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:57,274
He's trying to explain to Alex here that the media is bought off and then something very tragic statistics, Steve.

933
00:55:57,382 --> 00:55:58,686
Something really tragic happens.

934
00:55:58,748 --> 00:55:59,118
Yeah.

935
00:55:59,204 --> 00:56:04,220
Explain to people that a whole bunch of media outlets got bought off of contracts with five or two years ago.

936
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:06,970
Yeah.

937
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:18,350
Well, we know that the White House has spent a billion dollars on influencing media and giving money to media to promote these vaccines.

938
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:40,850
And the drug companies we don't know what the contracts say, but it's pretty clear that there was no interest at hello? Have we lost the call, sir? Have we lost the show? Hey, you got your wish.

939
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:44,490
The jazz comes back, baby.

940
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,730
You can't get rid of jazz.

941
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:51,546
I don't know what was going on in this episode, but it was weird.

942
00:56:51,678 --> 00:56:58,362
Okay, this seems like a great time for Alex to bring up the time that Trump got that donation from Pfizer.

943
00:56:58,386 --> 00:57:00,750
Right? Because we learned about that on our last episode.

944
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:06,686
Yeah, I mean, if you're talking about Pfizer conspiracies now it seems like Trump being involved with that that you admitted to.

945
00:57:06,748 --> 00:57:08,860
No, you just need that relevant information.

946
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:10,370
Not right now.

947
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:10,910
Oh, okay.

948
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,158
This is a different thing.

949
00:57:12,304 --> 00:57:14,574
I do appreciate the lack of continuity.

950
00:57:14,682 --> 00:57:15,930
This clip is just dumb.

951
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:19,406
And I'll see if you can figure out why I cut this.

952
00:57:19,468 --> 00:57:20,802
Because there's not enough jazz.

953
00:57:20,886 --> 00:57:23,870
No, this is really like keep your ears open.

954
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:24,566
Okay.

955
00:57:24,748 --> 00:57:27,638
So even their own leftists now are waking up.

956
00:57:27,784 --> 00:57:30,410
And I just look at Twitter, Facebook, everywhere I've been looking.

957
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:33,318
It's just everywhere people are saying I'm paralyzed.

958
00:57:33,354 --> 00:57:34,074
My mom's dead.

959
00:57:34,122 --> 00:57:35,058
My kids are paralyzed.

960
00:57:35,094 --> 00:57:35,538
I died.

961
00:57:35,574 --> 00:57:36,710
My husband died.

962
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:41,318
Why did I pull that clip? I don't know.

963
00:57:41,344 --> 00:57:45,714
He's looking on Twitter and Facebook and everywhere he tweeted, I died.

964
00:57:45,822 --> 00:57:46,480
Yeah.

965
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:54,420
I mean okay, all right.

966
00:57:55,830 --> 00:57:59,078
I know he's just talking too fast, but it's funny.

967
00:57:59,234 --> 00:58:00,562
There is something about it.

968
00:58:00,576 --> 00:58:02,318
Everybody's out there tweeting, I paralyzed.

969
00:58:02,354 --> 00:58:03,134
My mom sick.

970
00:58:03,182 --> 00:58:04,150
I died.

971
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:09,110
It left her spirit.

972
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:18,242
Wasn't that what A Christmas Carol was really all about? If you're in the shadow realm, are you shadow band? No.

973
00:58:18,316 --> 00:58:22,958
I think if you're in the shadow realm, you actually get past the shadow band because you can move through it.

974
00:58:23,104 --> 00:58:23,800
Okay.

975
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:26,970
The shadow band is like a door in the shadow realm.

976
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:30,174
A regular human couldn't pass through the shadow door.

977
00:58:30,222 --> 00:58:33,854
So you're saying that all the most popular Twitter accounts are ghosts? Yes, absolutely.

978
00:58:34,012 --> 00:58:34,610
Makes sense.

979
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:35,270
Yes.

980
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:45,170
So what is drill but a ghost? Steve has a story to tell, my friend, and this is dumb and we see people in plain sight.

981
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:48,330
I saw an Arab ambassador.

982
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:52,410
He's speaking at a podium, and he just drops dead.

983
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:56,378
But we've seen that over and over and over again.

984
00:58:56,464 --> 00:58:58,526
Have we? The vaccines rolled out.

985
00:58:58,648 --> 00:59:05,138
So the way Steve is telling this story, it's very clear that the only thing he knows here is that he's seen a video on social media.

986
00:59:05,224 --> 00:59:05,618
Right.

987
00:59:05,704 --> 00:59:10,514
He has no idea who this person was or the circumstances depicted in the video at all.

988
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:13,710
And the big tell is that he's calling him an Arab ambassador.

989
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:14,426
Yeah.

990
00:59:14,608 --> 00:59:20,054
This was the narrative that took hold as the video traveled in antivaxx circles online, but it's not correct.

991
00:59:20,212 --> 00:59:28,854
It was actually a Saudi businessman named Muhammad bin Nasar bin Wazan Alkatani, who was in Egypt for a conference.

992
00:59:28,962 --> 00:59:34,770
He was giving a speech, and he collapsed, allegedly going on to die in another room as we were attempted to provide aid.

993
00:59:34,830 --> 00:59:35,198
Okay.

994
00:59:35,284 --> 00:59:42,006
The cause of death here is not determined yet, and there's no evidence that Alcatani was or was not vaccinated.

995
00:59:42,138 --> 00:59:50,440
All of this is just forced conjecture on Steve's part because it's more profitable for him to make this suspicious when it very well could have just been a heart attack.

996
00:59:51,490 --> 01:00:01,970
There's no reason to automatically be like, why aren't they telling us what's going on here? I can't get over the idea that we've seen this over and over.

997
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:08,198
I have not seen a ton of videos of people collapsing at podiums recently, or, in fact, in my entire life.

998
01:00:08,284 --> 01:00:09,614
There haven't been that many.

999
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:18,640
How many can you remember of just people collapsing at podiums in the middle of a speech? Well, I saw this one that Steve posted, right? Well, that was the one, yes.

1000
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:22,686
I'm even going to count George Bush having to duck from her shoe.

1001
01:00:22,758 --> 01:00:23,486
I'll count that.

1002
01:00:23,548 --> 01:00:29,010
I think I saw a cartoon once of somebody who was in a debate club, like, a kid who was in a debate club.

1003
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:30,174
All right, rattling.

1004
01:00:30,222 --> 01:00:33,018
Off the points, and then he ran out of air and just collapsed.

1005
01:00:33,174 --> 01:00:34,038
Hey, Arnold.

1006
01:00:34,134 --> 01:00:36,530
I think it might have been I don't know.

1007
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:39,678
It's something in that sort of milieu.

1008
01:00:39,834 --> 01:00:41,514
It's in the same part of my brain.

1009
01:00:41,562 --> 01:00:41,810
Sure.

1010
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:42,818
Something that might have been on.

1011
01:00:42,844 --> 01:00:43,374
Hey, Arnold.

1012
01:00:43,422 --> 01:00:44,042
I'm going to go with it.

1013
01:00:44,056 --> 01:00:45,714
It wasn't real monsters.

1014
01:00:45,762 --> 01:00:46,614
Not a real monster.

1015
01:00:46,662 --> 01:00:48,090
It was real monster.

1016
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:48,758
It was not.

1017
01:00:48,844 --> 01:00:49,722
It wasn't Rocco's.

1018
01:00:49,746 --> 01:00:50,474
Modern life.

1019
01:00:50,572 --> 01:00:51,506
That's a good one, though.

1020
01:00:51,568 --> 01:00:54,698
Wasn't Sifil and Ollie? No, definitely not.

1021
01:00:54,724 --> 01:00:55,122
Cartoon.

1022
01:00:55,146 --> 01:00:57,160
Wasn't Ren and Stimpy? No.

1023
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:02,798
You know what I need to do? What's that? I need to go back to some of that stuff and see if it's any good.

1024
01:01:02,884 --> 01:01:04,190
Or maybe I shouldn't.

1025
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:06,722
No.

1026
01:01:06,856 --> 01:01:10,062
Yeah, you stop smoking weed.

1027
01:01:10,086 --> 01:01:10,814
You shouldn't go back.

1028
01:01:10,852 --> 01:01:11,474
That's a good point.

1029
01:01:11,512 --> 01:01:11,678
Yeah.

1030
01:01:11,704 --> 01:01:14,630
You don't want to know what it's like without the assistance.

1031
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:19,910
So Steve has these strategies in order to create his content.

1032
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:26,078
You have, obviously, this weird Google form that he wants to be able to fill out with information.

1033
01:01:26,164 --> 01:01:28,646
They very well could be making up Google crime form.

1034
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:32,514
But then the old standby is obviously there's.

1035
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:38,454
He misuses Vares data in order to make points and, man, this is nuts.

1036
01:01:38,622 --> 01:01:41,390
It's pretty obvious what is going on.

1037
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:48,002
There is no way to explain the various data, which is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.

1038
01:01:48,076 --> 01:01:49,034
That was my next question.

1039
01:01:49,132 --> 01:01:50,498
You're the expert on this.

1040
01:01:50,644 --> 01:01:51,482
I'm going to interrupt you.

1041
01:01:51,496 --> 01:01:52,922
But not getting into the data.

1042
01:01:52,996 --> 01:01:54,350
Just give us the main data points.

1043
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,900
You get that? Anybody can check.

1044
01:01:57,430 --> 01:02:04,182
Yeah, well, anybody can go to openvers.com and there's something called the red box summaries.

1045
01:02:04,266 --> 01:02:16,226
And if you go to that page@openvares.com, go to the red box summaries and you flip the slider because it shows you by default, it shows you the worldwide numbers.

1046
01:02:16,348 --> 01:02:21,186
You flip the switch to Go US, only you'll see around 14,000 deaths.

1047
01:02:21,318 --> 01:02:31,226
Now, the problem there is that the 14,000 underreported deaths, because people don't report to the various system.

1048
01:02:31,408 --> 01:02:38,140
And so it turns out that for every death reported to varys, they're really about 20.

1049
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:46,718
Sorry, I'm getting into the why are you struggling with it? Yeah.

1050
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:47,114
All right.

1051
01:02:47,152 --> 01:02:54,926
Now, I escaped the death blow here, but, yeah, if you look at the various numbers, you'll see $14,000.

1052
01:02:54,928 --> 01:02:57,098
You need to multiply that by 41.

1053
01:02:57,184 --> 01:02:59,186
Why? Okay, sure.

1054
01:02:59,368 --> 01:03:00,038
Great.

1055
01:03:00,184 --> 01:03:06,966
See, there's under reporting, and this makes some sense for some side effects, like maybe a headache.

1056
01:03:07,038 --> 01:03:08,654
Right? Because not everybody's going to report ahead.

1057
01:03:08,692 --> 01:03:11,354
Why would you report a headache? Nausea? It could be anything.

1058
01:03:11,452 --> 01:03:11,786
Sure.

1059
01:03:11,848 --> 01:03:12,326
Yeah.

1060
01:03:12,448 --> 01:03:13,622
Death is a little different.

1061
01:03:13,696 --> 01:03:14,978
It's hard not to report it.

1062
01:03:15,004 --> 01:03:17,202
Yeah, because there's other people who are doing the reporting.

1063
01:03:17,226 --> 01:03:18,570
You can't self report death.

1064
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:19,142
No.

1065
01:03:19,276 --> 01:03:20,598
Except for that guy who tweeted.

1066
01:03:20,694 --> 01:03:23,510
That was, I mean, all time Tweet, though.

1067
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:25,922
That was maybe his most important Tweet ever.

1068
01:03:25,996 --> 01:03:26,378
Yeah.

1069
01:03:26,464 --> 01:03:27,522
Certainly better than Musk's.

1070
01:03:27,546 --> 01:03:28,730
Dumb shit.

1071
01:03:29,530 --> 01:03:30,280
Yeah.

1072
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:31,358
I don't know.

1073
01:03:31,444 --> 01:03:44,982
This is ludicrous, and there's no defense of multiplying it by 41 Hands, the actual website that he's using, the open vehicles, it says on the bottom, these are not causal.

1074
01:03:45,126 --> 01:03:46,730
This is not causal data.

1075
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,218
That conclusion cannot be made.

1076
01:03:48,244 --> 01:03:50,510
There's a qualifier on the page.

1077
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:51,014
It does.

1078
01:03:51,052 --> 01:03:51,842
Oh, fuck yourself.

1079
01:03:51,916 --> 01:03:54,114
Doesn't it add at the bottom? This is not causal.

1080
01:03:54,162 --> 01:03:56,440
But you should multiply it by 41.

1081
01:03:56,830 --> 01:03:59,894
What? 41? And get a Google form.

1082
01:03:59,992 --> 01:04:00,640
Yeah.

1083
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:02,378
Oh, no, of course.

1084
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:04,278
He's a fan of shit.

1085
01:04:04,314 --> 01:04:05,778
Now I can't pull a song title.

1086
01:04:05,874 --> 01:04:07,060
Some 41.

1087
01:04:07,870 --> 01:04:08,846
That's what it is.

1088
01:04:08,908 --> 01:04:09,520
Yeah.

1089
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:13,182
Scrolling to the party like, my name is El Camino.

1090
01:04:13,326 --> 01:04:14,114
See, there we go.

1091
01:04:14,152 --> 01:04:16,074
Hanging out, drinking in the back of an El Camino.

1092
01:04:16,122 --> 01:04:19,914
Name another Some 41 song in too deep.

1093
01:04:20,082 --> 01:04:20,630
Wow.

1094
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:27,158
Because I'm in too deep and I'm trying to keep is that really what they sounded like? Yeah.

1095
01:04:27,244 --> 01:04:27,818
Wow.

1096
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:30,518
Weren't they supposed to be, like, punk or something? They were.

1097
01:04:30,544 --> 01:04:31,482
They were pop punk.

1098
01:04:31,566 --> 01:04:31,958
Oh.

1099
01:04:32,044 --> 01:04:34,180
Those two things don't exist together.

1100
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:46,230
Doesn't everybody know that? That those two things can't be back and it works for a while? There was a guy named Steveo in that band, and I always thought that was weird because he was around after Jackass.

1101
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:48,702
So he just took the name Stevo.

1102
01:04:48,786 --> 01:04:49,526
That's not fair.

1103
01:04:49,588 --> 01:04:53,562
Yeah, you should have to have Stevo in your band if he names himself Stevo.

1104
01:04:53,586 --> 01:04:55,614
Or you've got to staple your balls to your legs.

1105
01:04:55,782 --> 01:04:59,030
There's two options then you're grandfathered in on the name.

1106
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:00,818
Yeah, but you have to put sticks in there.

1107
01:05:00,844 --> 01:05:01,338
You're a drummer.

1108
01:05:01,374 --> 01:05:02,634
Goddammit, show respect.

1109
01:05:02,682 --> 01:05:03,798
Look, there's another steve.

1110
01:05:03,834 --> 01:05:04,458
Who's? Not a steve.

1111
01:05:04,494 --> 01:05:06,234
OSH.

1112
01:05:06,342 --> 01:05:07,218
Steve O kirch.

1113
01:05:07,254 --> 01:05:08,860
Now that's a different story.

1114
01:05:11,570 --> 01:05:12,538
This is so stupid.

1115
01:05:12,574 --> 01:05:25,820
Okay, so, Alex, do you know how much Tony Faucey is making every time a majorna shot is delivered into taste? A lot.

1116
01:05:26,810 --> 01:05:28,340
You see, that's the problem.

1117
01:05:28,670 --> 01:05:36,020
So we have somebody who's directing this entire vaccination program who has a huge conflict of interest.

1118
01:05:39,990 --> 01:05:43,330
That is not something that should be allowed.

1119
01:05:44,010 --> 01:05:45,466
No, of course not.

1120
01:05:45,588 --> 01:05:56,902
We should know exactly how much he's making on these vaccines and we're not allowed to know that? How much is Fauchy making every time someone gets a Maderna shot? When? Here's the problem.

1121
01:05:57,036 --> 01:06:05,414
I don't know when would he have negotiated a specific two M cut of each shot? Strange.

1122
01:06:05,582 --> 01:06:12,970
When? What contract would he have been a privy to? Plus, I thought Steve was, like, a stats and facts guy.

1123
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:14,378
This is meaningless.

1124
01:06:14,534 --> 01:06:18,106
Why don't we know why don't we know how much of a taste Dr.

1125
01:06:18,168 --> 01:06:20,510
Fauchy is getting? Apparently by himself.

1126
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:22,570
Not like the CDC is making a cut.

1127
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:23,942
No, just Fauchy.

1128
01:06:24,026 --> 01:06:26,618
This is just rampant speculation and insinuation.

1129
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:34,586
And if Steve was pressed on this question by a competent reporter, he couldn't even say that Fauche made a single penny when someone got a madurn a shot.

1130
01:06:34,718 --> 01:06:39,358
Also, this conspiracy is internally stupid because here's where things break down.

1131
01:06:39,504 --> 01:06:47,938
So Fouchy is pushing these shots to get rich, which he's willing to kill off 12 million people in order to achieve, apparently 10,000 a day.

1132
01:06:48,024 --> 01:06:48,490
Right.

1133
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:51,506
He's so money hungry, he just doesn't give a fuck.

1134
01:06:51,638 --> 01:07:02,878
Then why was the Pfizer vaccine the first one that was approved? Wouldn't he have stood to make way more money if Maduro was the first one out of the gate? No, that's too much scrutiny, too many eyes on you.

1135
01:07:02,904 --> 01:07:04,562
You negotiate with the second tier.

1136
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:05,870
You don't want to get that rich.

1137
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:06,490
No way.

1138
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:11,258
If that you were really able to orchestrate this entire pandemic and the vaccine rollout.

1139
01:07:11,294 --> 01:07:13,462
And a big part of his motivation was money.

1140
01:07:13,596 --> 01:07:22,778
Why would over 130,000,000 less doses of moderna been administered than Pfizer? I'm sure the answer to this is the trashy gets a taste of both shots.

1141
01:07:22,874 --> 01:07:25,574
Sure, it doesn't really matter, but this is double.

1142
01:07:25,622 --> 01:07:29,966
Well, you got to figure that it's two shots for each vaccine.

1143
01:07:30,038 --> 01:07:31,270
So he doubles that up.

1144
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:31,690
Of course.

1145
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:33,178
Yeah, that's the way you get it.

1146
01:07:33,204 --> 01:07:35,174
And he gets even higher cut on the booster.

1147
01:07:35,222 --> 01:07:38,050
Yeah, why not the margin? Yes.

1148
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:41,314
It's like once you've made back your advance yeah, I got you.

1149
01:07:41,352 --> 01:07:50,090
By all means, I would love for Steve to lay out whatever stock holdings he believes Fauche has or explain this nonsense, but he's not going to do any of that because he's just talking shit.

1150
01:07:50,210 --> 01:07:56,086
It's easy to talk shit when you just make suggestions and insinuate guilt on people for fun.

1151
01:07:56,268 --> 01:08:00,674
Steve spends a fair amount of this interview wondering why people won't talk to him or take him seriously.

1152
01:08:00,722 --> 01:08:05,594
And this is a big part of why this shit flies on your dumb substack or infowars.

1153
01:08:05,642 --> 01:08:10,020
But if you try to go to the real world with it, where words mean things, it's going to be a problem.

1154
01:08:10,470 --> 01:08:14,830
And that's even like even Brian Killmead will not let you play this fucking stupid.

1155
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:22,306
OAN wouldn't allow you to be like, hey, how much does Faucet get per vet? Actually, they might.

1156
01:08:22,428 --> 01:08:22,714
Yes.

1157
01:08:22,752 --> 01:08:23,974
But I mean, that's crazy.

1158
01:08:24,132 --> 01:08:25,258
That's too crazy.

1159
01:08:25,404 --> 01:08:29,870
You could go to OAN, you could go to Infowars, maybe you could go to Lindel's shit.

1160
01:08:29,930 --> 01:08:30,190
Right.

1161
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:31,934
And that might be about where you pee.

1162
01:08:31,982 --> 01:08:32,338
Yeah.

1163
01:08:32,424 --> 01:08:36,010
Oh, wait, I think he was on Brett Weinstein's podcast.

1164
01:08:37,470 --> 01:08:40,754
Okay, well, we've all reached the pinnacle of our careers.

1165
01:08:40,802 --> 01:08:42,118
I think so.

1166
01:08:42,144 --> 01:08:43,042
Alex almost went.

1167
01:08:43,116 --> 01:08:43,894
Well, Steve's gone.

1168
01:08:43,932 --> 01:08:51,262
Now Alex interviews another fucking Denier guy and I'm just like, I can't do it.

1169
01:08:51,276 --> 01:08:54,778
How can we can't still be denying COVID you can.

1170
01:08:54,864 --> 01:08:58,702
No, I think it's because Alex is trying to ramp up with the Trump stuff.

1171
01:08:58,776 --> 01:08:59,086
Sure.

1172
01:08:59,148 --> 01:09:12,178
I think that is like Covet is becoming front and center because the midterms are coming up and maybe he needs a way to have narrative flexibility or whatever it was.

1173
01:09:12,204 --> 01:09:12,542
Strategic.

1174
01:09:12,566 --> 01:09:13,538
Strategic flexibility.

1175
01:09:13,634 --> 01:09:14,280
Yeah.

1176
01:09:14,670 --> 01:09:18,550
So I think that's maybe what's going on.

1177
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,040
Right? I'm not sure.

1178
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:30,910
I'm kind of feeling like by ramping up the vaccine talk, that gives Alex the wedge for the eventual or an uneventual push.

1179
01:09:32,370 --> 01:09:39,998
Conversely, it could be the kind of content you need to put out in order to get Trump to realize he should join the antivaxx.

1180
01:09:40,034 --> 01:09:40,558
Sure.

1181
01:09:40,704 --> 01:09:43,980
So it kind of has multiple applications, man.

1182
01:09:44,370 --> 01:09:52,810
It's kind of interesting to me that he doesn't understand narcissism because ironically, there's no way Trump would ever do that.

1183
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:56,410
He feels proud of the vaccine for doing it.

1184
01:09:56,460 --> 01:10:02,726
So in order for him to change his mind on that, he would have to take an accomplishment away from himself.

1185
01:10:02,798 --> 01:10:03,142
Right.

1186
01:10:03,216 --> 01:10:08,866
Which would be one of the few things that he could say, like, I more or less saved millions of lives.

1187
01:10:08,928 --> 01:10:09,550
Exactly.

1188
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:10,306
Yeah.

1189
01:10:10,428 --> 01:10:19,190
That's a legitimate thing that he obviously didn't do instead, like sentencing through his incompetence millions of people to death.

1190
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:22,342
But it's still better than nothing.

1191
01:10:22,416 --> 01:10:23,458
Yeah, I guess.

1192
01:10:23,604 --> 01:10:25,930
Can't take away the vaccine's existence.

1193
01:10:26,490 --> 01:10:31,070
It happened under Operation Warp Speed, I suppose.

1194
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:31,390
Yeah.

1195
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:37,320
And I can understand why, even if you weren't a narcissist, why you wouldn't want to not be.

1196
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,118
That one's kind of pretty good.

1197
01:10:39,264 --> 01:10:40,894
Unequivocally pretty good.

1198
01:10:40,932 --> 01:10:44,858
But then if you're a narcissist, it's going to be like trying to get a ball away from a dope.

1199
01:10:44,894 --> 01:10:45,094
No.

1200
01:10:45,132 --> 01:10:47,410
Can you imagine? Actually, sometimes it's not that hard.

1201
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:57,310
Well, I mean, I'm talking about like, imagine if Richard Linkl, if Alex had to be like, I hated the movies that I was in, that would never happen.

1202
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,830
Or I hated my performance, or I hated what happened.

1203
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:00,754
Shit on Link later.

1204
01:11:00,852 --> 01:11:04,154
No, I know he talks shit on Link later, but not on his movies.

1205
01:11:04,322 --> 01:11:06,970
He wouldn't be like, I sucked in that movie.

1206
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:09,360
Yeah, probably not.

1207
01:11:09,930 --> 01:11:10,680
Yeah.

1208
01:11:11,130 --> 01:11:12,334
It's hard to say.

1209
01:11:12,432 --> 01:11:18,230
This is why you need to have a mentality of like, kill your darlings.

1210
01:11:18,290 --> 01:11:20,426
That kind of mentality.

1211
01:11:20,618 --> 01:11:23,458
Whatever these idols are, you tear them down.

1212
01:11:23,544 --> 01:11:25,354
If you like something, get rid of it.

1213
01:11:25,392 --> 01:11:25,702
Right.

1214
01:11:25,776 --> 01:11:26,446
Yeah.

1215
01:11:26,628 --> 01:11:30,670
You can't sit around and think about how great it was that you made that vaccine.

1216
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:33,202
Eyes ahead, eyes ahead.

1217
01:11:33,276 --> 01:11:34,846
Burn the boats behind you.

1218
01:11:34,908 --> 01:11:35,494
Right.

1219
01:11:35,652 --> 01:11:40,260
You have to lick a toad and go out to the woods and break a copy of Waking Life.

1220
01:11:40,650 --> 01:11:41,750
Ceremonially.

1221
01:11:41,870 --> 01:11:43,270
Whatever you got to do, man.

1222
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:44,530
Spirit journey.

1223
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:49,678
Yeah, but I think that there is a way you make an interesting point.

1224
01:11:49,704 --> 01:11:56,450
I'm trying to find this sort of angle of how you could appeal to a narcissist to get them to become antivaxx.

1225
01:11:56,510 --> 01:11:56,986
Right.

1226
01:11:57,108 --> 01:12:02,566
And I guess it really comes down to what you want, what that person wants.

1227
01:12:02,688 --> 01:12:02,974
Right.

1228
01:12:03,012 --> 01:12:09,538
If they're out for money or power or something, you could make an argument that there's more money in power on this side.

1229
01:12:09,624 --> 01:12:10,260
True.

1230
01:12:11,070 --> 01:12:16,214
But it does still run up against the disowning your own achievement.

1231
01:12:16,262 --> 01:12:16,930
I mean, yeah.

1232
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:20,218
That seems like the rock in a hard place kind of situation.

1233
01:12:20,304 --> 01:12:21,214
Here's my end.

1234
01:12:21,252 --> 01:12:25,582
The way that Alex is presenting this is like you admit you were wrong.

1235
01:12:25,776 --> 01:12:26,940
Yes, exactly.

1236
01:12:27,450 --> 01:12:28,354
That's not going to happen.

1237
01:12:28,392 --> 01:12:46,862
It's going to be a tough no here's what you do, all right? You get on a plane with him, all right? Hook them up to a machine that allows you to go inside his dreams, all right? You play Genal Rhian regret noir, all right? Then you go another level deep inside of his dream.

1238
01:12:46,886 --> 01:12:48,490
Are you following me here? I think so.

1239
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:48,754
Okay.

1240
01:12:48,792 --> 01:12:49,918
Now, here's the crazy part.

1241
01:12:49,944 --> 01:12:52,222
You have to have somebody build mazes for you.

1242
01:12:52,296 --> 01:12:54,790
Why? Don't ask questions.

1243
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:55,990
Now, let me ask you this.

1244
01:12:56,040 --> 01:13:00,082
What's that? Can I bring a top? Yeah.

1245
01:13:00,156 --> 01:13:00,538
Okay.

1246
01:13:00,624 --> 01:13:01,522
I'm in.

1247
01:13:01,716 --> 01:13:02,470
Let's go.

1248
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:03,300
All right.

1249
01:13:03,870 --> 01:13:10,670
So Steve leaves, and Alex talks to that other antivax guy who I was fighting.

1250
01:13:10,790 --> 01:13:11,318
Sleep.

1251
01:13:11,414 --> 01:13:12,070
Sure.

1252
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:13,814
It's mostly about actuaries.

1253
01:13:13,862 --> 01:13:14,002
Yes.

1254
01:13:14,016 --> 01:13:15,886
I'd rather rewatch inception than that.

1255
01:13:15,948 --> 01:13:16,282
Yeah.

1256
01:13:16,356 --> 01:13:20,220
So, after that, Alex sits down and wants to talk a little business.

1257
01:13:20,550 --> 01:13:21,922
A little bitcoin business.

1258
01:13:21,996 --> 01:13:22,510
Oh, no.

1259
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,142
That Bitcoin donation that he got.

1260
01:13:24,216 --> 01:13:24,778
Okay.

1261
01:13:24,924 --> 01:13:28,750
And I wish I knew how tired of the situation was the last few years.

1262
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:33,878
I knew it was bad, but I got lack of days ago.

1263
01:13:33,904 --> 01:13:35,030
I didn't focus on things.

1264
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,590
I didn't focus on bringing in money.

1265
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:37,466
We almost went.

1266
01:13:37,528 --> 01:13:39,654
Really? That's what you said? In bankruptcy.

1267
01:13:39,702 --> 01:13:48,254
But if we hadn't gotten that $8 million donation in Bitcoin by the time we cashed out a little bit less than 8 million when it came in, it was like $9 million.

1268
01:13:48,292 --> 01:13:53,754
But I waited to see if it would go up and went down, whoever that person, diamond Hanson.

1269
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:57,280
Because I didn't know we weren't $3 million behind.

1270
01:13:59,290 --> 01:14:03,040
We were $6 million behind.

1271
01:14:04,870 --> 01:14:05,862
We were insolvent.

1272
01:14:05,886 --> 01:14:13,646
My accountant told me right after we paid off the debts of 6 million and we bought $2 million a product.

1273
01:14:13,768 --> 01:14:14,800
Oh, my God.

1274
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:17,702
It's not coming in.

1275
01:14:17,896 --> 01:14:20,822
That if we are good stewards of that, we can continue to be on air.

1276
01:14:20,896 --> 01:14:36,040
You talk about God working in mysterious ways if you don't know there's a God, who is this unknown donor that literally knew my finances better than me and gave us exactly the amount that we played the cards? Exactly right.

1277
01:14:38,230 --> 01:14:39,554
But that's how God works.

1278
01:14:39,652 --> 01:14:43,542
I wonder if Alex understands how much more suspicious that makes the donation.

1279
01:14:43,626 --> 01:14:44,930
I mean, good God.

1280
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:45,458
I know.

1281
01:14:45,484 --> 01:14:45,758
I know.

1282
01:14:45,784 --> 01:14:49,562
It's God or whatever, but in the real world, this sounds like a fucking shady deal.

1283
01:14:49,636 --> 01:14:50,260
Yeah.

1284
01:14:50,710 --> 01:14:54,894
Also, based on his telling of things, it would seem that Alex doesn't qualify for bankruptcy.

1285
01:14:55,002 --> 01:15:04,410
If he was $6 million in the hole and then he paid it off with that divine donation, on what grounds is he declaring bankruptcy? No, they're solvent now, so he's declaring bankruptcy.

1286
01:15:04,470 --> 01:15:05,474
Wait, hold on.

1287
01:15:05,572 --> 01:15:08,070
What? That seems odd.

1288
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:08,462
Yes.

1289
01:15:08,536 --> 01:15:10,970
This is some real televangelist shit right here.

1290
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:16,454
This is like the most amazing well, to be fair, this is something that Alex does from time to time.

1291
01:15:16,492 --> 01:15:16,922
Oh, no.

1292
01:15:16,996 --> 01:15:21,880
Money bombs always make exactly what he needs because it's God's will and what have you.

1293
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:24,902
That's the shit that the televangelist can do.

1294
01:15:24,976 --> 01:15:31,686
I have two private jets, but they gave me just the exact amount of money that I piss out on a daily basis.

1295
01:15:31,818 --> 01:15:33,160
That keeps us going.

1296
01:15:34,210 --> 01:15:35,342
It's fun.

1297
01:15:35,536 --> 01:15:39,940
So look, all this money that Alex wants you to give him sure.

1298
01:15:40,930 --> 01:15:42,182
He doesn't need it.

1299
01:15:42,316 --> 01:15:45,354
I'm sorry, what? He could start a podcast tomorrow.

1300
01:15:45,462 --> 01:15:48,746
He should have focused more on making money is what he just said.

1301
01:15:48,808 --> 01:15:51,926
No, now he's going to say that he doesn't need money, but he does.

1302
01:15:51,988 --> 01:15:52,874
But not for him.

1303
01:15:52,972 --> 01:15:53,798
Okay, I got you.

1304
01:15:53,824 --> 01:15:54,458
And we're still here.

1305
01:15:54,484 --> 01:15:55,574
And they can't stand it.

1306
01:15:55,612 --> 01:15:59,814
They have big show trials, thousands of articles, hundreds of TV programs that's conservatively.

1307
01:15:59,862 --> 01:16:00,330
Thousands.

1308
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:01,614
Conservative programs.

1309
01:16:01,662 --> 01:16:02,610
Hundreds of thousands of articles.

1310
01:16:02,670 --> 01:16:03,282
Thousands of articles.

1311
01:16:03,306 --> 01:16:04,466
And now you've seen it.

1312
01:16:04,648 --> 01:16:11,318
But they're going to invade a country lying about us, just attain a jury to try to win a lawsuit to shut us down.

1313
01:16:11,404 --> 01:16:13,420
They're not going to shut anything down.

1314
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:19,900
I can walk across the street and fire up a podcast that reaches the same amount of people today.

1315
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:34,346
But you won't have the Derek Mcgreens and the Greg Reese's and all these incredible Adon Salazar's and the Kit Daniels and everybody else that writes the articles and reports and does all this other amazing stuff.

1316
01:16:34,468 --> 01:16:39,100
We don't want them to shut us down or slow us down any level.

1317
01:16:39,490 --> 01:16:42,278
And you can end their power over us right now.

1318
01:16:42,424 --> 01:16:46,898
You can shut their asses down by financially supporting us@infoworkstore.com.

1319
01:16:46,984 --> 01:16:50,020
You can help me allude consequences right now.

1320
01:16:50,650 --> 01:17:04,540
Yeah, I don't know if it's a good sales pitch to be like, what about Darren Mcbreed? Yeah, no, I mean, won't somebody think of the Darren Mcbridge's? It's tough to think about what would happen to them if infowars would go away.

1321
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:09,734
I saw that some outlet tracked down one of the jurors and talk to them about that.

1322
01:17:09,772 --> 01:17:13,890
I really feel like an interesting piece would be showing one of the jurors.

1323
01:17:13,950 --> 01:17:22,262
Or if you could all of the jurors like these videos afterwards and seeing how they would feel about their judgment, then that would be a really interesting thing.

1324
01:17:22,336 --> 01:17:22,960
Yeah.

1325
01:17:23,470 --> 01:17:26,298
I wonder if they'd be like, oh, I'd go much larger.

1326
01:17:26,334 --> 01:17:30,674
Yeah, I wonder if they would listen to this and be like, wow, we should have known all of this.

1327
01:17:30,712 --> 01:17:39,990
But I also wonder how much of it is like the distinction between the actual damages and the punitive damages.

1328
01:17:40,050 --> 01:17:40,634
Right.

1329
01:17:40,792 --> 01:17:44,034
I wonder if that would be swayed by him just being a total shithead.

1330
01:17:44,082 --> 01:17:50,670
Yeah, I imagine that they came to the compensatory damages based on, like, math and shit.

1331
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:59,500
And then if they knew that the punitive damages would come out to Alex as being like, they're not going to do fuck all to us and we've destroyed them.

1332
01:18:00,010 --> 01:18:01,842
Punitive damages don't exist.

1333
01:18:01,926 --> 01:18:10,274
If the punishment is then equalled out by the guys saying, fuck, you didn't mean anything, that's not really punitive then, is it? Not really.

1334
01:18:10,372 --> 01:18:10,670
Right.

1335
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:14,402
But if there are caps in Texas, then I don't know what you can do.

1336
01:18:14,596 --> 01:18:15,230
I don't know.

1337
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:16,180
It's a mess.

1338
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:17,886
Texas justice.

1339
01:18:17,958 --> 01:18:22,730
Also, Alex couldn't start a podcast tomorrow and get as many listeners because he's kicked off itunes.

1340
01:18:23,710 --> 01:18:25,146
It's going to be tough.

1341
01:18:25,338 --> 01:18:27,806
I don't think Spotify is going to really go for you either.

1342
01:18:27,868 --> 01:18:35,634
No, because even the episodes of Rogan with him all day, they're not going to give you your own show after getting rid of their most popular podcaster.

1343
01:18:35,682 --> 01:18:36,630
You could go to Stitcher.

1344
01:18:36,690 --> 01:18:37,694
Yeah, well, maybe.

1345
01:18:37,792 --> 01:18:43,662
Anyway, the show ends with a protracted bizarre sales pitch.

1346
01:18:43,806 --> 01:18:48,170
Get DNA force, get Bodies, get our great immune support, get Ultra Twelve.

1347
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:49,010
Get X Two.

1348
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:51,270
The supermodel vitality finally back in stock.

1349
01:18:51,330 --> 01:18:55,590
And know that you are literally in an arm wrestling contest with Satan.

1350
01:18:55,710 --> 01:18:57,590
And all I am is the arm.

1351
01:18:57,970 --> 01:19:06,940
What infowars is the arm? What? I got a strong arm and a strong will, but the power to hold it in position is you.

1352
01:19:07,630 --> 01:19:09,414
So when I'm struggling, you're struggling.

1353
01:19:09,462 --> 01:19:17,954
When I'm in combat with these people and they're doing everything they can, it's much easier to just stop sitting here at a stalemate with them and for you to just to get behind us.

1354
01:19:17,992 --> 01:19:22,586
Pray tonight for us, pray tomorrow for us, spread the word about us, buy the products.

1355
01:19:22,648 --> 01:19:25,754
And I'm telling you, we're going to slam their hand down.

1356
01:19:25,792 --> 01:19:30,530
We're going to beat their ass and smell nothing but victory.

1357
01:19:32,770 --> 01:19:38,046
I'm not a victory, but the spirit I got right here is victory.

1358
01:19:38,238 --> 01:19:40,130
And I have never felt better.

1359
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:43,120
I have never felt stronger because of you.

1360
01:19:43,510 --> 01:19:46,454
Because God works through souls and done it.

1361
01:19:46,492 --> 01:19:50,630
And you've done incredible things through our lives together.

1362
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:51,518
Think about it.

1363
01:19:51,544 --> 01:19:52,854
We're the number one enemy.

1364
01:19:52,962 --> 01:19:54,686
We're who the enemy hates more than anybody.

1365
01:19:54,748 --> 01:19:57,314
Why is that? Because I'm real and you're real.

1366
01:19:57,412 --> 01:20:00,378
And together we create an energy loop.

1367
01:20:00,474 --> 01:20:04,422
What? A synergy and an amplifying network of goodness.

1368
01:20:04,506 --> 01:20:07,866
I thought you were in our they want to shut down the churches during lockdown.

1369
01:20:08,058 --> 01:20:12,650
What? We're good people coming together and we're doing it now together.

01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:16,946

What a ride.

1373
01:20:21,070 --> 01:20:26,174
I feel like he just watched over the Top last night and then just went off from there.

1374
01:20:26,332 --> 01:20:28,826
He was like, I've got this arm wrestling thing.

1375
01:20:28,948 --> 01:20:30,170
I'm the arm.

1376
01:20:30,550 --> 01:20:31,910
That doesn't make sense.

1377
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:32,858
They're the body.

1378
01:20:32,944 --> 01:20:34,214
All right, we're doing this.

1379
01:20:34,252 --> 01:20:35,598
We're back mate with the devil.

1380
01:20:35,634 --> 01:20:37,362
We're back now we're at a stalemate.

1381
01:20:37,446 --> 01:20:39,340
And now we're all just energy.

1382
01:20:40,030 --> 01:20:42,194
We're feeding off of each other.

1383
01:20:42,232 --> 01:20:42,954
We're synergy.

1384
01:20:43,002 --> 01:20:43,718
Not even just energy.

1385
01:20:43,744 --> 01:20:44,814
We're an energy loop.

1386
01:20:44,862 --> 01:20:46,634
We're an energy loop because I'm real.

1387
01:20:46,732 --> 01:20:47,282
You're real.

1388
01:20:47,356 --> 01:20:54,470
Why is that matter? Well, when this hand wrestling arm wrestling contest, I feel like the arm wrestling got lost there at the end.

1389
01:20:54,640 --> 01:21:00,100
It was just a conduit with which he could ask you for money, but he doesn't need it.

1390
01:21:00,670 --> 01:21:03,602
But I want to win the arm wrestling contest now.

1391
01:21:03,796 --> 01:21:06,810
Would you leave kate Daniels high and dry in an arm wrestling.

1392
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:09,318
I wouldn't want him to feel that kind of alone.

1393
01:21:09,354 --> 01:21:18,458
The guy who is so talented, famed somebody and then cried in a deposition about it weren't for Kit, I would say we don't need to give info or money.

1394
01:21:18,484 --> 01:21:24,450
But now that I know that it's for Kit and what do you think about Greg Reese? I've never thought about Greg Reese.

1395
01:21:24,510 --> 01:21:25,394
It's not healthy too.

1396
01:21:25,432 --> 01:21:26,630
No, it's a bad idea.

1397
01:21:26,740 --> 01:21:31,070
So we come to the end of this and I don't think we learned all that much about Dugan's daughter.

1398
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:37,506
I found myself to be underwhelmed by his coverage and a lot of it was just about himself.

1399
01:21:37,578 --> 01:21:45,674
And why can't I do false flag stuff when they can? Right? A lot of that stuff.

1400
01:21:45,772 --> 01:21:52,154
I always appreciate our episodes that start with a topic and then end with you having to remind me what it was.

1401
01:21:52,192 --> 01:21:54,410
The topic was happens more than it should.

1402
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:56,126
It really happens a lot.

1403
01:21:56,308 --> 01:22:00,234
It doesn't happen as often as people collapsing at podiums on live TV.

1404
01:22:00,282 --> 01:22:02,090
And that's happening all the time.

1405
01:22:02,260 --> 01:22:03,182
All the time.

1406
01:22:03,256 --> 01:22:04,370
It's nuts.

1407
01:22:04,990 --> 01:22:07,722
So anyway, I like that jazz.

1408
01:22:07,806 --> 01:22:10,550
I wonder if that will be a new feature in the show.

1409
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:17,642
I wonder if that's a sign of, like, GCN just giving up elevator music from now on.

1410
01:22:17,716 --> 01:22:25,170
Yeah, I could start an elevator music podcast across the street tomorrow from iPad Goes Walking and Wench.

1411
01:22:25,230 --> 01:22:28,430
Look, we'll be back, but tell them we have a website.

1412
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:29,138
Indeed we do.

1413
01:22:29,164 --> 01:22:30,170
It's Alexfight.com.

1414
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:30,362
Yeah.

1415
01:22:30,376 --> 01:22:31,122
We're also on Twitter.

1416
01:22:31,146 --> 01:22:33,470
We are Twitter at that dollarjungscore fights.

1417
01:22:33,850 --> 01:22:35,778
We will be back, but until then, I'm Leo.

1418
01:22:35,814 --> 01:22:36,222
I'm Leo.

1419
01:22:36,246 --> 01:22:37,218
I'm dzx Clark.

1420
01:22:37,254 --> 01:22:40,254
I'm wilford snippet snabbl of the Gripple PIBBLE.

1421
01:22:40,362 --> 01:22:42,486
And now here comes the sex robot.

1422
01:22:42,558 --> 01:22:44,018
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air.

1423
01:22:44,044 --> 01:22:47,214
Thanks for holding, Alex.

1424
01:22:47,262 --> 01:22:48,186
I'm a first time caller.

1425
01:22:48,198 --> 01:22:48,954
I'm a huge fan.

1426
01:22:49,002 --> 01:22:49,790
I love your work.

1427
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:50,180
I love you.
