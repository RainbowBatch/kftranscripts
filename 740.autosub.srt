00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Air Jordan

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Dot-com

5
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,792
Exit

6
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,816
Alex Jones

7
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,864
Indeed we are.

8
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,656
Foria

9
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:15,264
I might catch some heat

10
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,616
Take maybe I don't know

11
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:23,712
Alright of course the

12
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,736
Do my cats

13
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,016
Course

14
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,832
Something that I realize I realize I do

15
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,136
I hadn't realized it but I really enjoy it

16
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:36,256
And that is like if I ever have a knife in my hand I like to threaten to leave with it

17
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:43,168
The holder it LifePoint alright alright

18
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:48,544
Obviously

19
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,872
Obviously also I should say I'm not close

20
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:58,272
To her it's up to her

21
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:04,672
Hold their hand up and then fall over going

22
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:08,768
Cool it's very cool to see it it's like a game

23
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:12,864
A game nor is it fun to see there is a little bit of

24
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,424
It's just for me really

25
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,728
Amount of course I give her some Pat

26
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,752
Send

27
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,776
Got some attention.

28
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,312
End end sweetness after

29
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,080
Two words.

30
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:22,848
It is

31
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,128
Bruchis not fret

32
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:32,832
Better now that your roommate is only a cat because when you used to do that to your other roommate that was a little bit of a difficult order

33
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,904
Halloween

34
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:44,096
My bright spot is your dog

35
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,120
Pulling up to you right now

36
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:51,776
Anime cyberpunk edgerunner so I downloaded the game Sacramento

37
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,568
377 is a very fun

38
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
Enjoyable game that's my bright spot

39
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:58,176
Yeah you told me to

40
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,200
Give it a shot

41
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:02,784
I'm a little I'm not very far in the game at this point

42
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,344
I like running around

43
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,208
The space I don't know anything that's going on I did

44
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:15,584
Find like an abandoned motel and I felt really excited that I could wander around in

45
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:19,936
I don't know if that's part of a later Mission or something

46
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:23,520
I was just digging through trash and I enjoyed

47
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:28,896
I'm not very far to do it either and there was a moment earlier on where they were treating my character like

48
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,176
This is the best

49
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:35,552
And I was like man I have not done s*** I don't know what you guys are talking about

50
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,368
Yeah thank you

51
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:41,440
Put some respect on my name I appreciate that but

52
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,512
Yeah so good times

53
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,536
Jordan

54
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,584
Today we have an episode

55
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,120
To do and I have a little question

56
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,680
The answer is

57
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:55,776
34 no does Alex Jones

58
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,360
The Aerosmith song rag doll have in common

59
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,688
Are they there

60
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:09,088
Still on Hiatus note they can both be found on Permanent Vacation

61
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:15,488
That was where radiohead's album

62
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,536
Different directions but alright

63
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,071
Alex

64
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:24,959
Is on vacation

65
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,727
Difficult position

66
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
We have these

67
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,031
Deposition

68
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:33,663
The course from that obviously but

69
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:39,039
Some of that is a little bit to time-intensive and secondarily I don't want to put out

70
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:42,623
Back-to-back-to-back there's a real out of depositions

71
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:48,511
Left us in a position where we were able to recoup a little bit

72
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,071
Take a note

73
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,607
Do nurse

74
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,655
Ourselves back to health our psychic

75
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,447
Wounds

76
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,775
But here we are it's Wednesday so what I've decided

77
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,311
I want to go back to the past

78
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,895
Google an unfortunately this episode will prove me to be a witch

79
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:10,271
Okay

80
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,807
I'm sick of your Witcher 2.

81
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,111
You have no idea

82
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,671
DIA

83
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,719
Alright

84
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:23,071
Who's going to be our first episode where we just play the Clips in order and then at the end I go

85
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:28,447
Really that's crazy when I was like preparing this episode I

86
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,239
More than once I said come on

87
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,591
Smokey Bear

88
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:40,991
It would be more fun if if Neo in The Matrix had taken the red pill but just remembered everything was like

89
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:44,575
All day

90
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:50,975
Huh anyway we'll get down to this before we do Jordyn Taylor

91
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,999

Go take a little break now

110
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,071
A little breaking for me

111
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,887
And then we're going to

112
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,655

114
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
F*** you

I got plenty work for you

116
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,687
At the end of the day

117
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,735
F*** you and your new world order

118
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,783
She rode in on

119
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,063
All your s***

120
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,599
Maybe today

121
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,927
Maybe I'll just be gone a month maybe 5 years

122
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,743
Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow

123
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,279
And you never see me again

124
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,327
That's really what I want to do

125
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,887
I never want to come back here again

126
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,423
I apologize to the

127
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,287
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

128
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,335
I'll be better tomorrow

129
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,895
We'll never know if now better today or not

130
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,919
So that's true

131
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,599
No certainly.

132
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,415
So today we're talking about August 13th

133
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,719
2003

134
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,743
The

135
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,023
No update

136
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:07,423
Whether or not to Alex's chronology they are being

137
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:13,823
Put in power rack Asda pacification is out there are developments Alex still believes

138
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,103
Hussain son still alive

139
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:19,967
I have not gotten an update on that say yes I do

140
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:26,367
And continuity on Alex's show yes that is still great

141
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:31,743
Murdered in a ritual sacrifice true

142
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,559
But one of the biggest dangling threads

143
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,375
And that went by that I mean the most muscley

144
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,167
Is Arnold Schwarzenegger

145
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,983
Doesn't want to talk about

146
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:46,335
He did not want to talk about absolutely

147
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,103
He doesn't

148
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:47,871
W

149
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:54,271
The media is making him talk about Arnold Schwarzenegger absolutely and so he died

150
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,551
Quite a bit

151
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111
Information

152
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,743
I'm around the world

153
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,303
You going over there

154
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,351
Curaleaf

155
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,375
Break

156
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,543
About

157
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,311
The whole

158
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,479
Amor

159
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,247
Reaper

160
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,111
Because it is

161
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,183
Bryant

162
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,975
Diversion

163
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:36,767
From

164
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,047
I all the real

165
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,655
Preparing

166
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,319
Are you portable

167
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,583
So you see there

168
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,215
First of all this presentation was forced to talk about all sorts of a ridiculous

169
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,751
List of

170
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:25,151
Complaints a lot of that stuff sounds exactly like what you would hear nowadays he's for abortion

171
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,431
But

172
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,991
The focus is on

173
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,271
Homosexuals

174
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,039
At this point

175
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,831
It's 2003.

176
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:36,415
And this is where it is appropriate for Alex to attack

177
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:40,255
You viewed the gay community as

178
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,535
Vulnerable enough

179
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,071
For him to bully

180
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,887
At this point yeah which change

181
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,935
Yeah yeah

182
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,239
You do I feel like a lot of us

183
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,799
After so much time

184
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,847
You know passed this we all kind of

185
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,871
Thought well

186
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,639
I guess

187
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,175
Our parents in Denver

188
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,967
Religions and all kind of like

189
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:00,991
Moved past

190
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,551
The whole gay thing you know they would they would like

191
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,087
Well

192
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,903
People did marriage marriage is happening and yet

193
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:14,559
Nobody's being murdered by God all day everyday so we're probably good and now we live in a moment where we re

194
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,327
Realize that those

195
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,351
23 2000

196
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,887
2003 thoughts

197
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:21,215
Just got quieter

198
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,263
No no it was

199
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,543
People realize

200
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,823
Bad they couldn't

201
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,175
Express these things in public anymore with the opinions did not change

202
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:35,551
Nothing whatsoever in In fairness maybe there is some subsection that

203
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:38,111
Some population that did evolve in there

204
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,159
And realize I called

205
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,951
Maybe they don't need to hold on to

206
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:47,327
There is it wasn't the massive sea change necessarily

207
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,887
Let it appear to be based on

208
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:56,287
Yeah and that complacency I think is Maybe

209
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,335
A problem yeah yeah

210
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:01,407
So I was thinking about like what is going on

211
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,711
With this this Arnold stuff

212
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,759
Because it's so it's incest

213
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,527
Fan

214
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,831
I realized on this episode

215
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,599
Alex was

216
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,159
Very much talking about Arnold

217
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,719
Specifically in the context of Mel Gibbs

218
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,279
And I kind of came to realize

219
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,071
That it was

220
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
Cuz

221
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,375
Mel Gibson's getting Heat

222
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:27,007
For Passion of the Christ and his family's anti-Semitic

223
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,823
Alex is trying to attack Arnold

224
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,847
Do cover

225
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,615
Call Gibbs

226
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,943
Did Mel change his name to ye recently or was it

227
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,223
No no

228
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,503
No are you sure

229
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,295
No they're very similar

230
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,879
Who was the we'll talk about this here a little bit later

231
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,695
Cars

232
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
Call Tanner

233
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,983
This is amazing

234
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
Salesman

235
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,399
Tamara

236
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,959
World War

237
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:40,223
So a lot of this around essentially the Simon wiesenthal Center

238
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,503
Of Mel Gibson's film

239
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,783
Right I am the

240
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,855
Gibson family simultaneously endorsing

241
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,671
Arnold that's basically we're all this is rooted

242
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,999
It's pretty clear the game Alex is playing in the reason he asked

243
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:55,583
The cover of the startled even though he doesn't

244
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,351
Hey is just

245
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:00,959
He loves Mel and hunting Gibson and the two of them are very clear anti-semites

246
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,775
Mel's new film The Passion of the Christ is getting flak

247
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,823
For being anti-semitic Allentown

248
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:12,223
Simultaneously Arnold is running for governor of California and he said some stuff about Hitler in the mid-70s that's been taken out of context

249
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,551
Text SA officer in occupied Austria

250
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,367
So this is the way that Alex is going to take some heat out

251
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,903
Off of his actual

252
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,671
Asthmatic

253
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,695
Right right alright

254
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,975
Obviously it's not

255
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,767
Good for your dad to be a Nazi

256
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,047
But that doesn't make you enough

257
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,351
What's ironic about this

258
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
Almost

259
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,423
More than anything I can think of

260
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,727
Is Mel Gibson's dad

261
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,031
Allied powers

262
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,823
Schwarzenegger's dad

263
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,615
Axis powers

264
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,895
Mel Gibson

265
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,967
Axis power

266
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:49,343
Allied Power do you see where I'm coming from here to generation

267
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:55,231
Obviously like you would ideally it if I had to choose all possible fathers

268
00:14:55,487 --> 00:15:01,631
Nazi would not be watched on the comment

269
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:05,727
Hitler's oratory skills when you're a youth but that doesn't make you a Nazi either

270
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,847
Call the flipside Marilyn Hutton Gibson personally engaged in explicit anti-semitic actor

271
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,895
Concluding Holocaust denial and revisionism

272
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,175
Alex node

273
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:21,087
If Mel decided to speak out against Trump in early 2016 mysteriously become aware of all this s***

274
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:27,487
Used it to attack him but here we are in 2003 and Alex's smearing Arnold just because he needs to carry water

275
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,279
Where is Father and Son big attacked

276
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,327
Apparently we'll talk

277
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,631
It's it's

278
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:38,495
So clear that Arnold is only interesting to Allie

279
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,775
Flexing as much as

280
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,847
Like he can use it to deflect from LA

281
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,383
Right he's a he's a

282
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,455
Bye-bye bigotry barrier

283
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,759
He is he's the police

284
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,551
Shield of bear of big

285
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:57,951
Make a tree or whatever into like

286
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,255
On the last show.

287
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,071
Please just give me a reason to Alexa I'm not just

288
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:07,423
Making this up every time I want to defend anti-semites

289
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,447
I have to be like

290
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:14,847
I don't want to do that I want to make fun of Mel Gibson Arnold Schwarzenegger come on man

291
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:20,735
So Alex has Joyce Riley on his another host apparently on his Network

292
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,039
Complain a little bit about Arnold

293
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:25,855
America

294
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:52,223
Simon wiesenthal Center

295
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,367
No it is all hypocrisy

296
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,927
But it's all delusion it is all a fraud

297
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:05,791
That's why I don't get as angry as I used to because I see through it now

298
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,863
It's all good fun and it's further enough

299
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,983
The theme of the day which seems to be that Alex is mad that people are calling while Gibson anti-semitic but not Arnel

300
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:20,895
Alex wants to wear as Gibson is a zealot extremist whose father is parent

301
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,687
Only friends with Alex or Alex

302
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:26,271
Edward saying for accurate accusations of him being a bigot

303
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,647
I wanted to play this because it shows a very intentional misdirection by Joyce and Alex

304
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:36,767
They say that the Simon wiesenthal Centre found that Arnold's father was a Nazi and that is true

305
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,791
But they're purple

306
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,607
Omitting some information that Their audience

307
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,631
It would benefit from having

308
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:46,239
The first thing isn't Arnold requested they investigate his father's background

309
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:52,127
He was not in any way trying to hide from the the pastor the reality of his father's bad.

310
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:58,271
The second thing is that the center wasn't necessarily setting out to determine if his dad was involved in the Nazi party

311
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,063
That was all pretty much

312
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,087
Understood in

313
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,623
Definitively known right

314
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,671
Arnold saw his dad's uniform

315
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,951
I'm scrolling up you get the

316
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:12,351
Yeah they were tasked with poring over records from the Holocaust in determining if the specific groups that Arnold's father was a

317
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:18,751
The member of had any recorded history of committing crimes against humanity or similar across rice

318
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:25,151
Is my dad a Nazi Arnold's like was my dad is super genocider or just like onboard with them I'm guessing it also

319
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:29,247
I was like how how much of a microwave

320
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,575
The result of the investigation was that there is no such record

321
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:37,183
The consensus seems to be that there is no affirmative evidence of him committed war crimes

322
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,487
But war records are also in Perth

323
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,279
So we can't be fully ruled out

324
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:48,447
Whatever the case be sins of the father are not necessarily appropriate to take out on the sun and it's dumb

325
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,263
I did or didn't do in WWII Arnold's fault

326
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:56,639
Joyce and Alex say that the investigation found that his dad was a Nazi but they don't include the other day

327
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,687
Details because that would hurt their point

328
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,479
This isn't intentional choice

329
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:07,391
The stuff about admiring Hitler's taken out of context and Arnold has successfully sued people for making these kinds of claims

330
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,159
The past

331
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:14,303
There's nothing but Kurt Waldheim is fair enough but with Alex's referring to is a toast that Arnold gave it his wedding

332
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,583
Hey 1986

333
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:19,423
At that point there's no reason to think that Arnold would have known about Walt

334
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,239
Of All Times lies about his actions in World War II

335
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,799
Since reporting about that didn't start until that year

336
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,615
And accusations of his involvement in war crimes

337
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,151
Didn't happen until 1987

338
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,455
There's a lot of shadiness

339
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,991
That is fair to say

340
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:36,575
But what Alex is doing is a shameful mischaracterization of a person

341
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:41,439
And he's doing it specifically to distract from his clearly anti-semitic friend yeah

342
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,975
It's very strange

343
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,023
I mean not strange at all

344
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:51,679
What I find very boring about Nazis is that every Nazi has at one point

345
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,447
In time been like

346
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,263
You know you got to admire Hitler for blank

347
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,103
Right but then they've also always been at one point been like

348
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,943
Hey did you see this person they said Hitler was good for black

349
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:07,807
Yeah you know like Alex is Hitler's complete matters it's every one of them if done

350
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,367
Every single one of them have done it but I also think

351
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,183
That a lot of people in their youth

352
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,231
I have said things that were like

353
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,767
Hitler was a great speaker

354
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,327
Very able to get

355
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,119
People to follow him music

356
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:27,519
You know in that sense he had great leadership a lot of folks who may be

357
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:33,919
You.

358
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:38,783
What about history

359
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:43,135
It feels transgressive

360
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,183
Bold statement that no one has thought of

361
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:45,951
Before

362
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,559
Arnold making statements like that in his youth

363
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,607
I don't really think

364
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,143
Is indicative of

365
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,167
Him being an author

366
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,727
So far Arnold

367
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,519
Not enough

368
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,079
Also I'm not sitting here to like

369
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,407
Fully defined Arnold Schwarzenegger

370
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:11,807
This dude is bullshiting of all the criticisms that I have Arnold Schwarzenegger none of them are heat

371
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,831
Enough

372
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,672
So Alex is always right about everything

373
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,952
Except for everything

374
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,256
Here's an example of something is not right about

375
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,424
And it's also going to be a medical draft and it's Medical

376
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,704
People learn about this

377
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,776
I think you're going to see a real change of heart hair

378
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,104
Southtown

379
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,896
Program

380
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,664
Are all

381
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,432
Commercial Drive

382
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,528
Rock

383
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,512
German

384
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:55,840
Oh man we got ice cream truck snitches

385
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:00,960
Yep I love I love whatever

386
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,752
Alex's collars

387
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,032
Bring up

388
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,592
The reason no apology

389
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,640
Do whatever they bring up

390
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,968
On their own the reason why something won't happen

391
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:17,600
As evidence for what will happen after it does you know like there's a grown-up people won't stand for it

392
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:23,488
Is it a draft for people to not to go along with it

393
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:27,328
I don't think doctors and stuff will go along with it that's why they won't do with it

394
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:34,240
What are you talkin about a course they won't go along with it

395
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:37,056
But what you can do is force ice cream

396
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,592
Truck drivers to snitch

397
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:42,944
Constitution

398
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,248
Yeah so every commercial driver

399
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,528
Every

400
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,856
Driver Long Haul

401
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,232
They all were enlisted

402
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:59,840
Irene well if they do have the infrastructure to communicate with

403
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,120
Beach other over vast distance

404
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,144
Speedo

405
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,424
Yeah there is that

406
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,288
They don't use that to solve crimes

407
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:13,664
Driving you're just listen to the radio maybe if you were also solving crime

408
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,224
I see a jaywalker on my six

409
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:22,368
Moving to run him over thank you thank you

410
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,160
Permission to use lethal Force

411
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,632
Alex has some new stories

412
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,680
It's quite a quite a rundown

413
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,032
Are denied bail

414
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,824
Wheeler please gilding

415
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,592
Arraignment

416
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,152
People who

417
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,248
What is the Chinese government

418
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,952
So weird strange low-stakes story for hooks to be covering

419
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:02,304
The guy who got charged with a misdemeanor for stockpiling gunpowder unsafely

420
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:07,936
Which I understand does touch on top of the Second Amendment absolutism but it seems like small potatoes

421
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:13,312
Play poke around and found out that this was the case of 61 year old Maryland man to level wheeler

422
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:19,968
As it turns out in this state is it illegal to have more than 5 lb of smokeless gunpowder and also illegal

423
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,272
The story of anything other than its original

424
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,576
Container cuz it's been credibly unsafe

425
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,160
Chanel

426
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,952
Particularly unsafe it is

427
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,000
Are you sure you could blow up your house

428
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:32,768
But also week

429
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,536
Could affect your neighbor

430
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,096
But just you

431
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,400
Wheeler was storing this s***

432
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,960
Container

433
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,008
It's a little bit over the limit

434
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:43,776
Is

435
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,056
What do

436
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,360
Why when does the cop showed up

437
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:53,760
Officers literature from the National Alliance Group based in West Virginia and told them

438
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,784
Race war was coming

439
00:24:55,808 --> 00:25:00,160
Wheeler claimed he wasn't a Nazi or anything but that his wife was a member of the National Alliance

440
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,208
It hosted a radio show called quote

441
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:05,536
Grandmother Elizabeth reading hour for white children

442
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,864
Quite a pretty name for a show

443
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,424
Do if I can get more

444
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,520
Details that put my job on the floor

445
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:18,080
Session of details that make me go.

446
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:23,200
Dreams about many of these stories that Alex covers are minor almost

447
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,992
Completely inconsequential stories

448
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,296
Involving people who are Nazis

449
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:31,648
Call so weird how Alex just ignores that part when he's covering the story

450
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:37,024
Super weird to imagine like what websites he's cruising to find this Story 2

451
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,352
I can't imagine this was breaking on the front page of CNN

452
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:43,680
But probably was pretty hot topic on Neo-Nazi message board

453
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:50,080
Yeah the guardian didn't cover it but Stormfront did is not a good way to start your show

454
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:54,944
So big bigger important got a touch on this news breakdown

455
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,224
Here's my problem

456
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,504
Here is my

457
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,272
Alright

458
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:01,344
If you do think there is a race war,

459
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,160
Still don't know how that much.

460
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,440
The gunpowder going to help you

461
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,464
Convert

462
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,840
Could

463
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,888
Yeah well I don't know

464
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:16,960
I don't know if I necessarily think

465
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,240
That this is a guy who has

466
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,264
Tactic

467
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,128
Sure do I understand overarching strategy is it is

468
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,152
Fully clear

469
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,968
He also claims that he doesn't remember telling the cops that

470
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:30,272
Yeah that makes sense

471
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:36,672
The lawyer said we don't remember what you said to the cops earlier

472
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,232
So yeah

473
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,792
Good story selection

474
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:46,144
If I had several more than one pound

475
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:48,192
Of gunpowder on me

476
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,216
Onahan

477
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,776
I would very strongly respect

478
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:57,408
Actually you have the right to remain silent you know like that would be my number one right that I'm thinking of

479
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:00,224
It's like we don't need to ask questions about that gunpowder

480
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,064
So we got another news story that Alex is covering

481
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:08,672
Just a little heads up in advance there's some racist language

482
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,776
Court-ordered

483
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,040
Flow

484
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,880
Another headline

485
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,608
Forward

486
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,136
Gulf oil

487
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,424
Call Mom

488
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,944
Robert that seems like a good solution

489
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,992
Okay

490
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,552
Alright Google Fullerton yeah

491
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:42,368
Yeah

492
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,232
So first things first this is happening in the UK so there are different speech laws there than they are

493
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,000
In the United

494
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:54,656
If Alex loves National sovereignty so much why the f*** is he trying to enforce his own code of rules on people in another country

495
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:55,936
Very weird

496
00:28:56,448 --> 00:29:00,544
The story carries that Michael Guilfoyle made a bunch of abusive phone calls

497
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,360
Just trying to help with his rihousing app

498
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,128
Application

499
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:08,224
They complained about it in the Magistrate's court told him specifically that he

500
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,784
He can't use that word in public anymore

501
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:17,696
He's kicking his own home if he needs to but he will be in trouble if he uses it to harass or threaten people a

502
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,464
Again

503
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:24,864
There's no evidence that he got any jail time or punishment other than the city saying that you will be in trouble if he continues to use

504
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,400
Counselors to attack their employee

505
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:32,544
And I don't know I

506
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,896
If you attack somebody with anymore

507
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:37,920
Okay

508
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:41,760
I don't think we should be banned

509
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,040
Here's what I thought

510
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,320
Spears

511
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,880
It's for him right let's throw this out there

512
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,648
Alright

513
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,672
Maybe

514
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:51,232
We do a 10-year requiem

515
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,024
You know like 10 years

516
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,792
You can't

517
00:29:54,048 --> 00:30:00,192
Say it and then at the end of 10 years if you still want to say it let's see how you feel about time with a sunset clause

518
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:06,592
We're not being in words we're just seeing if you still want to say it after 10 years of not wanting to say because guess what there are other

519
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,152
You can figure it out

520
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:15,552
10 years you'll be like you know what I didn't really need that word in the first place you know what I was going to guess

521
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,088
Find any more in depth

522
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:22,976
Stories about this I'm going to guess that the order itself was a broader and like

523
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,768
Don't f****** harass people

524
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:29,888
The work for the council estate you no like I bet it was that

525
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,168
Ratman also

526
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,496
If you use these f****** racist terms again

527
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:38,592
Automatically get you in trouble where I live

528
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,664
Stop making abusive phone calls also

529
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:48,320
Alex sees racism being criticized until he gets got up

530
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:51,904
Superhero abs

531
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,208
So he

532
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,048
Jordan 22

533
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,352
Share some really disgusting language on Alex

534
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,424
Give me a 2003

535
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,496
Aue school to call her for using the word damn

536
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,592
Attorney at this point

537
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,616
You better make

538
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:32,096
Terrifying to imagine this is required listening for homeschoolers

539
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:34,656
This is a family show

540
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:36,704
Homeschool curriculum

541
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,728
Wow

542
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,544
I don't know what he meant by the c word

543
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,360
Because I didn't hear a single really feel like if he was talking about

544
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:48,736
The c-word then there's only one see where that I think of meet me too but I didn't hear that and I don't know if it was

545
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,016
Who's cut out or something

546
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:55,392
He used slurs earlier he sure did

547
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:57,440
Yeah but that's where the bar is

548
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,976
Graham is

549
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,256
Wearing

550
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,816
Taking the lord's name in vain bad

551
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:03,840
Racial slurs

552
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,864
Who said those are bad

553
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,424
They're not in the Bible funny show now he looks

554
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:11,520
Crying and screams about how he wants his enemies damn to hell

555
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:16,896
Come on I have some respect for the homeschooler

556
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,688
Ridiculous

557
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:23,296
Of all the things that my history textbooks taught me that were incorrect

558
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,576
Which is a lot

559
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,928
I eat still better than listening to Infowars that's for f****** share

560
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,208
Yeah yeah

561
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,512
I can't imagine how lost you'd be if

562
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,328
This was something that was treated as like

563
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,864
Accurate when you're young

564
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,912
Yeah can you imagine a

565
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,704
Text book filled with just

566
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,800
Banal versions of Alex's insane conspiracy theories

567
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:53,248
I've kind of read some of them in terms of like JBS literature and stuff so maybe I can imagine it

568
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,272
It's boo

569
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:56,576
Water filters

570
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,344
Sauron

571
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,648
The guy from from

572
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,440
Berkey Sharecare

573
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,256
All we need to know if the non limerick

574
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:08,096
Guy that's all we need to know about him

575
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:14,496
In a bit I think he doesn't pop up until later cuz I was in like the 2009 stretch

576
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:20,128
Haven't heard those episode Alex has a soap the cow Bend Soap Company as a sponsor

577
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:23,712
And their owner Marty Schechter shows up

578
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,992
ENT

579
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:31,392
Clearly had something in his contract where Alex had to let him tell a dirty Limerick every time

580
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,928
She has a limerick

581
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,696
And it's dirty

582
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:37,792
What a wild thing to be your calling card but what are you going to do

583
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:44,192
What we remember it oh yeah I've heard

584
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:48,032
Think if you didn't do that I would remember the name Calvin so absolutely not

585
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,312
Absolutely

586
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,896
I don't think so

587
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,920
But

588
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:54,688
The water filter

589
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,224
Sponsor is on

590
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,784
Of course they're selling water filters to buy Alex

591
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,344
Also I have to lie to him a little

592
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,584
Now your lawyer

593
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,264
Privilege

594
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:26,432
Now is this for the State of California

595
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,720
Report

596
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,304
We talked about this already

597
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,840
This is not getting rid of

598
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,376
Client

599
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,912
Confidentiality or whatever

600
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,496
But you can see how it looks sort of gullible is

601
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:55,104
Yeah I mean it was immediately like Holyoke

602
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,896
All of those rights are gone

603
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,712
This is what I find so fascinating

604
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:02,016
Is it once Alex has an inch

605
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,552
He's going to take them by off

606
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,088
For sure he does

607
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:06,624
Oh they're also

608
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,024
Well that's real sweet

609
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,400
Somebody was

610
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,448
15 years ago

611
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,240
Stark raving mad

612
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:26,848
Well here we are 19 years later and you are Stark raving mad

613
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:30,944
Shark raving mad Forever by your math

614
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:35,552
24u 34 years

615
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,600
Abolished

616
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,624
The jury system

617
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,440
I like God no confidentiality

618
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:47,840
Really I really like his responses to what should be earth-shattering

619
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:55,264
Exactly like that's the whole Bedrock of society is falling apart well

620
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,480
Yeah

621
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:12,416
It's kind of indicative of how little I'm not seriously these people take their own information probably

622
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:17,280
If someone was like they're taking away people's right

623
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,304
82 jerries

624
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,168
I think the responsibility to the streets

625
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,544
We've let them take away a lot of s*** but, I think this is

626
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,336
A little bit dumb

627
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:34,176
I think that this guy Jim

628
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,712
Waterboy gym

629
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:37,760
Is a little bit too dumb

630
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,832
Read that David Walker

631
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:45,952
Call division

632
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,232
Anyway

633
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,304
David wilkerson's like a doomsday type

634
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,072
Preacher guy

635
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,888
Yeah

636
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,448
A map that he had a vision

637
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:58,240
Doubt

638
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,008
And

639
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,056
What was going to take

640
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,080
Place in America

641
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,872
Back in the

642
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,640
19

643
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,944
70s

644
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,272
And it just seems like

645
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,392
I picked up a cup

646
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,440
You're going reread it and I couldn't believe

647
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,720
It was just all like it

648
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:19,488
Ancient history

649
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,096
They would start working

650
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,376
Gay

651
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,936
Ministers

652
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,752
What does a

653
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:31,520
Should never happen

654
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:33,824
And

655
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,408
Blah blah blah over why

656
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:40,992
His stuff that he was but he wrote that book back in 90

657
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:42,784
Panda

658
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,088
And it's been about a year since I've read it

659
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,880
What I can tell you is that the

660
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,648
The stuff that he

661
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,672
Road in there that

662
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:51,744
You would

663
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,816
People would be getting

664
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:56,864
TV

665
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,632
And it was like

666
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,960
American way back then

667
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,264
Cable TV

668
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,056
Everyday stuff

669
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:42,432
What is in a house

670
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:52,160
I tell you I don't know where it is

671
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,328
Science fiction movie in

672
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,888
Movies about Atlantis

673
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:02,656
Yeah

674
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,960
A lot of Alex's stuff. Seemed like a science-fiction

675
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,336
What about his fears of that show where 10 year olds are in a house

676
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,872
Spell

677
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:12,896
That's a

678
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:13,920
Not

679
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:18,016
I don't know this marinating baby thing

680
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:24,416
I'm a fan of everything this guy believes he's make it how much is making that sound like it was some kind of way like British

681
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,696
This Fear Factor video

682
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:32,096
Anita Baker I mean he just kind of made it sound like they had the guy ate a baby

683
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:36,192
What was that a single was that a special

684
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,080
Was there a miniseries sickly season 6 episodes at the time a lot you know

685
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,360
I got my boo

686
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:46,432
Was it drew Hayes

687
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,624
Baby I don't know what this is

688
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,160
Distance to Steve Tilley

689
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,440
Also I mean like

690
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:03,840
VHS was invented in the 70s I don't know what kind of prophecies

691
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,120
Dropping down but

692
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:11,520
Hey what some of these some of these Trends might be things you could see coming here's what I'll say

693
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,080
After the Gutenberg Bible was pregnant

694
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,104
You know

695
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:15,872
It took

696
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:18,176
A week before p*** was printed

697
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:18,944
You know like

698
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,248
Come on man we don't need to we don't need to jump

699
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:25,600
Too far into the future to be like oh yeah people make born out of that nobody right in your house

700
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,440
So Alex take some calls

701
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:31,488
And of course he's been talking the whole lot

702
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,256
About

703
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:37,120
Mel Gibson and the Simon wiesenthal Center

704
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,544
Mel Gibson

705
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,384
He put his resources

706
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,968
He's trying to get a man

707
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,504
Lacrosse and here we sit

708
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,808
And we just talked about it like that.

709
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,856
Isn't it ridiculous

710
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,472
When we got

711
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,872
If your ring

712
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:21,920
Ford Road

713
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:22,944
Years ago

714
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,480
Internet

715
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:26,784
You're going to find

716
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,808
The thief thief

717
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,112
To the camera

718
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,136
Christopher Cross

719
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,464
Queen Isabella

720
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,048
Jail

721
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,448
Your call I got to go

722
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:51,104
Alex was totally on board with this guy that a great time talking about how the Simon wiesenthal Center is

723
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,407
Is Beatriz doing Mel Gibson wrong

724
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,711
Yeah that other colors like yeah you know that

725
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,271
About the international Jew

726
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,599
Oh man you know

727
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:04,415
At a certain point you just got to be like hey

728
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,487
Obviously I think this

729
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:08,767
But we don't want to

730
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,583
Obviously I have a

731
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,351
Keen awareness

732
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:18,751
Miss that most of my audience believes this and they think that I'm using coded language and that's why

733
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,287
Why they enjoy my show

734
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:25,407
But you can't make it too obvious on air because then everyone knows this isn't

735
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:27,455
F****** Nazi shop

736
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:31,551
Shouldn't be a thing that we all just know all the time

737
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:36,159
Like all of us across the world human shouldn't we all just be able to be like a

738
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:38,463
Guess what this one's a Nazi show

739
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:40,255
Cuz this time this happened

740
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:43,327
And that's all we need to know

741
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,375
19tv enough

742
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:51,007
Sure I mean that we don't have to stop there but yes

743
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:53,311
The rest of the show gets weird

744
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,847
So I will

745
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,639
Say that

746
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,407
We have

747
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:03,807
Kind of planned where the idea was that we do an episode on Monday

748
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,111
How about a video that

749
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:08,415
Been posted on video

750
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:13,023
It was a fourth hour of Alex's show hosted by guy named Royce White

751
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:15,071
Who is a failed

752
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:17,887
GOP candidate to unseat

753
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:20,447
Ilhan Omar in Minnesota

754
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:26,591
And kid has taken to sending Kanye in a way that is Maybe

755
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:27,871
A bad way

756
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:28,639
To defend him

757
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:33,247
He's doubling down on some of the things Kanye saying and labeling

758
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:38,879
Jews who doesn't like and it's very it's very troubling

759
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,159
The

760
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:47,071
Trends that you're seeing in the right-wing right now in particularly the way anti-Semitism is so on the right

761
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,631
And emboldened

762
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,399
Bye

763
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,191
Statements of Kanye's making

764
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:57,055
You see Nick Fuentes coming out and really really going hard

765
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,591
Thanks to

766
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,127
Some of the cover

767
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,151
I guess you get

768
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:04,223
Trump Kanye and his behaviors

769
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,015
And you see it on info

770
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,319
Cccd

771
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,855
A certain section

772
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:10,879
Of the content

773
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,647
Being

774
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:18,047
Denial of like it's talking about right

775
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:20,863
If you know and then you have another section of it that is like

776
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:21,631
No

777
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,423
Actually he's right

778
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:29,311
And it's not all whatever

779
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,079
And

780
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,103
You go back to

781
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:37,247
2003 in kind of hoping for a different tone and then have a caller who's bringing up the international Jew

782
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,015
Man

783
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:39,551
I think

784
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:42,623
I think the lesson that you take away from this world that I think

785
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,415
It is appropriate to take away from this

786
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,183
This is

787
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:45,951
Bike

788
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,255
This is what the show is

789
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,279
Yeah

790
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,047
Yep

791
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:56,447
And also that's over twenty years regardless of whether or not somebody continues talking about hating Jews

792
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,471
Boy they sure still do

793
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:03,871
I mean like if you go to the video of Royce White's 4th our appearance switch

794
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:06,943
I should just really Strife is on Alex

795
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:08,991
The show it's a fourth hour of his show

796
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,271
Just with a gastos

797
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,575
The comments on it are like

798
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:15,391
Finally somebody is saying this stuff

799
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:21,279
And you know that's what the callers who expressed things like this are thinking

800
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:27,935
Is there waiting for Alex to finally just bring up that s*** man

801
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:31,007
Bring up that stuff that was adopting propaganda

802
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,567
But what you going to do

803
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:35,103
Yeah I mean Nano

804
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,895
Anyway it'll get worse later but

805
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,943
For now Alex has some other news

806
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:46,111
He just wants to jump away from that be like what what does make you think

807
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,903
Some other other news

808
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,583
Dial 911

809
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,631
Chronicle

810
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,799
You're not do that

811
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,079
Cam

812
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,103
This is bulshit

813
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:09,407
Willie Brown wasn't told not

814
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,175
The fly that

815
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:11,455
It's a

816
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:15,295
Misconception on a bulshit thing a 9-11 truther

817
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:19,135
Here's how he described the call he got from his Security contact

818
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,671
Text that work at the airport

819
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:22,207
Not Condoleezza Rice

820
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:27,327
He said the kommineni alarming session which is why I'm hesitant to make an alarming

821
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,095
Bank statement

822
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:33,983
It wasn't an abnormal call I'm always concerned if my flight is going to be on time and they always alert me if I autumn

823
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:34,751
Be careful

824
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:35,775
I guess what

825
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:38,335
He was still going to fly that day

826
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,127
He didn't change his plans

827
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:44,223
He only didn't fly because it was an 8 a.m. flight out of San Francisco which is

828
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,271
After the Trade Center it already been hit

829
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,807
He was going other

830
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:49,343
You going to go to the airport using Waze

831
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,671
Waiting for his ride when he saw the news of the attack on TV

832
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,207
How does making s*** up

833
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,999
Because he's a liar likes to f*** with his audio

834
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,535
Also fun fact

835
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:03,935
The claim that the warning to Brown came from Condoleezza Rice traces back to a comment made by Holocaust denier

836
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:04,959
David Irving

837
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:08,031
Do it no proof or the clam and he's just making that s*** up

838
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:11,615
Weird how there's so much. They should on the show even back in 2000

839
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:14,687
Yeah yeah it is it is like

840
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:20,831
Man back-in-the-day a conspiracy could be built out of a thing that literally everyone who flies now gets

841
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:21,599
Like I get

842
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,391
10 days every 5

843
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:27,231
Is changed in a minute you get a text update

844
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:28,511
Annabelle

845
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,559
20 years ago holyshit Izakaya

846
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:33,631
It is interesting

847
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:34,911
On some level

848
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:39,263
You know like what exactly was the nature of the concern

849
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:43,615
That the people at the airport were expressing to Willie Brown

850
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:47,455
He clearly wasn't that severe because he was going to fly anyway

851
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,223
Freitag

852
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:50,783
I'm also if it was something that in indica

853
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:51,551
It was indicative

854
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:52,831
Foreknowledge of the attack

855
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,111
That's kind of dumb

856
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,391
Because the flight

857
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,415
Was taking off

858
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,695
After the attack happened

859
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,487
There is a robin's egg

860
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,791
It was going to happen it was going to happen

861
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:05,375
And he wouldn't have to be warned at all because ain't played would never take off

862
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,679
So none of this makes any sense

863
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,727
He built out of nothing

864
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,775
And the Condoleezza Rice aspect comes

865
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,311
From Holocaust

866
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:15,103
It is a coincidence really

867
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,663
And a dawn Salazar would say it doesn't drive

868
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:20,991
That's true all right buddy

869
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:25,087
Dumb people have that means we need to report on this

870
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,159
So Alex's mother news

871
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,439
It's pretty severe stuff

872
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:31,999
I had a

873
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,023
Q questions here

874
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,631
Pennsylvania

875
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,007
Criticizing

876
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,407
And where was that at

877
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,063
Wow unbelievable

878
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,415
Pecan stuff for whatever

879
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:12,959
Didn't arrest him

880
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:14,751
I can find the UK

881
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:18,591
Literally no evidence of the supposed

882
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:23,967
If I had the gas with Alex's talking about there have been cases where anti-lgbtq protesters

883
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:27,807
Have yelled Old Testament verses that have been used to argue like

884
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:31,647
Homophobia being a pillar of Christianity

885
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:38,047
Yeah Leviticus generally arrested or cited for

886
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:41,119
Further comments but for other protesting related infraction

887
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,911
Whatever the case it's

888
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,447
Just not true that you can't

889
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,215
Retrieval test

890
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:45,983
Smitten Pennsylvania

891
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,799
Yeah I mean you know

892
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,847
Whatever he's complaining about

893
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:54,431
Most of the people that wanted to are probably in Congress now

894
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,455
Now so you know

895
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:59,295
Like in addition to this

896
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:01,343
We are not see thread

897
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:03,135
You also have

898
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:05,183
This preoccupation with

899
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,207
Like

900
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,487
Sort of homosexual

901
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:11,071
Being opposed to homosexuality

902
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,607
In a way that I would

903
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:13,375
Pretend

904
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:17,471
Isn't part of his worldview now you know there is a I'm cool

905
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:19,519
I'm fine yeah I'm good I'm here

906
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:20,287
Move it

907
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:26,943
But you look back on this like no you're not see any way we're not obviously

908
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:27,711
Dealing with

909
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:30,783
I don't get anymore

910
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:35,135
Anti-Semitism is authorized to hate trans people that hate lgbtq plus people

911
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:40,255
These are just literal Nazis were dealing with Nazis now we know how to deal with Nazis we're dealing with Nazi

912
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:42,815
This is what we're dealing with stop pretending like we're not

913
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,351
So I like

914
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,631
Is another color

915
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,399
Yep

916
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:49,727
Listen to Scholars interesting

917
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,263
Okay the next

918
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,799
Is This Is Us on

919

Bahamasair

920
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,847
Sexual movement

921
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,383
And

922
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,407
Here is the

923
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,687
This information I have

924
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:01,503
April

925
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,039
1999

926
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:04,319
There was

927
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,599
A bill presented

928
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:06,879
And evidently it pass

929
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:08,159
But this is what we need

930
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,183
Find out

931
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:12,511
The deal wasn't everyone get your pins out and write this

932
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,303
Do your homework

933
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,071
People

934
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:15,839
We need to buy

935
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:16,607
Find out about

936
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,911
But I think this is why they're being

937
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,191
So in our face

938
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:24,287
Putting all this it's HR 2431

939
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:25,823
And it was

940
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:26,847
Presented

941
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,639
The International Freedom

942
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:30,431
Some religious person

943
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,455
Fusion app

944
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,991
So this bill did pass

945
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,783
Became the international religious

946
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:36,319
Just Freedom Act of 1998

947
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:37,855
This caller thinks

948
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:38,879
Our lease is

949
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:40,671
But I imagine

950
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,695
But the bill is designed to

951
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:43,999
The gay people from religious persecution

952
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:49,887
Bruce actually about creating some governmental bodies that would monitor religious groups were being persecuted in other countries

953
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:51,679
An advocate on their behalf

954
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:57,055
This is really stupid stuff and I don't know why you would expect anything else on this show

955
00:51:57,311 --> 00:52:02,175
It is 2000 35 years after this bill became law and she's not even sure if it pass

956
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:10,367
That's what I thought her angle was going to be it was about like protecting gay people from

957
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:13,439
Religious persecution but that you kept talking

958
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:16,511
And I would say that given a million gases

959
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,815
I would never have predicted that this was her

960
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:19,839
Conspiracy

961
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,631
But now

962
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:25,471
For example now that I'm reading

963
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,007
Some days food sample

964
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,799
If the practice of

965
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,079
Actuality becomes

966
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:31,359
Defined as a religion

967
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:32,639
Tenon group

968
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,663
Posing homework

969
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:34,431
Sexuality

970
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:38,015
Violating their religious rights

971
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,295
And then any other

972
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,063
Its members

973
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:40,831
The universe

974
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:41,855
Refined

975
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:42,623
Jail

976
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:43,391
Armani

977
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,415
Carolee off

978
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:59,519
Right

979
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:00,287
What

980
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:02,847
What do the conspiracy is that this

981
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:03,615
Bill

982
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:07,199
Is part of the gay agenda and then they're going to use this

983
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:10,271
And then later they're going to make being gay a religion

984
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,087
What

985
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:19,487
What's the deal cuz you know what

986
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:20,255
Here's my pitch

987
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,535
Let's do it

988
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,071
I'm down

989
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:29,471
Down for it I will develop a religion based entirely around homosexuality and then the government

990
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:32,287
Have to allow her everything to work

991
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,591
I think that's how it works perfectly

992
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:37,407
Whether or not you are going

993
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:39,199
To unsuccessfully do this

994
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:43,295
The year of Our Lord 2022

995
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:45,599
Two

996
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,367
3

997
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,903
This is some silly

998
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:48,671
Did not have

999
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:51,743
But no hits yet come to pass

1000
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:53,279
Preoccupation

1001
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,047
The fear of

1002
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,327
People who

1003
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:57,631
Another color

1004
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:00,191
Trends are happening here

1005
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:03,775
Yes I do

00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,591
Datavideo police 83

1007
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:11,455
Salute whether you serve good or evil

1008
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,527
Very very good

1009
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:22,719
Oh yeah it is wrong

1010
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:25,279
Long hate Islam

1011
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,559
We can call the Pervert

1012
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:27,327
Hurtsboro

1013
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:29,375
They get on TV everyday

1014
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,655
Understand

1015
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:31,935
Speaking out the truth

1016
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:33,727
Doublethink is that

1017
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:45,503
That's the sky

1018
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:47,551
Call Alexandra long

1019
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:49,343
United States Mark of quality

1020
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,135
Right and

1021
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:54,975
Apparently he's mad that people don't like kitty calls gay people

1022
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:55,743
Perverts

1023
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:58,559
Yeah yeah

1024
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:04,959
Yeah you know it if you didn't know real view of some of this audience it feels it feels

1025
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:08,031
It feels awful to know that 20 years has meant nothing

1026
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:10,847
Yeah I'm useless

1027
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:13,663
Pointless waste of 20 years

1028
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:18,271
Text Cowboy

1029
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,463
Well I wanted

1030
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,231
Statesboro

1031
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:28,511
Down. Two things

1032
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:32,095
The Jewish people you know there

1033
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,119
Kinds of Jews

1034
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,655
I believe I used to have a paper ID

1035
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,447
People all the time

1036
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:38,495
The ones that

1037
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:40,543
We need to be worried about are the

1038
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,871
No one ever uses that word

1039
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,407
They're still afraid

1040
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:51,551
They will not stay communist youth

1041
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:55,135
Why does Alex I mean obviously I know the answer to this

1042
00:55:55,391 --> 00:56:01,535
It's sort of rhetorical is Alex allow someone to keep talking after they say there are six kinds of Jews

1043
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,559
Oh boy

1044
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:04,607
Well I mean

1045
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:11,007
What good is going to come out of the rest of the sentence okay so it was 2003 I think

1046
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:15,615
Pokemon Gold had just been released pretty recently so you know he's like

1047
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:17,151
You gotta catch em all

1048
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:20,991
Right you got that on his brain and then she listened and he doesn't

1049
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,015
The second part

1050
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:23,551
Which I totally got you know

1051
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:25,599
Rihanna

1057
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:37,631

Coming out and saying this horrible stuff

1063
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:50,431
We have him being interviewed on Tucker Carlson.

Occupations of him making the rounds on tons

00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:24,223
Candace Owens has tricked him into buying parlor

1077
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:26,271
Funny part about all of this

1078
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:29,599
And then you have things that you see you like

1079
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:31,647
Do you know people in Bolton buy it

1080
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:32,927
You no going back

1081
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:33,951
Back to the past and

1082
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:35,231
I'm sitting in of seeing

1083
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:36,255
And episode

1084
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:39,071
That is so heavily

1085
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:40,607
This

1086
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:41,631
It's

1087
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,167
Upsetting

1088
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:43,935
Yes I do

1089
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:47,007
I mean

1090
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,287
We did a show

1091
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:50,847
We did not believe

1092
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:53,919
That Jews ran the world and some evil

1093
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:54,943
Conspiracy

1094
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:55,711
Right

1095
00:57:56,735 --> 00:58:01,087
We we do we do do a show where we don't believe that Jews Run the World

1096
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:07,487
But we were also pitching a conspiracy around the world

1097
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:11,583
We had a day where we had calls like this

1098
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:12,863
It would be awake

1099
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:15,679
It would be a be a crisis

1100
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:19,519
It would be a moment of what am I putting out into the world

1101
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:21,567
Sam's of mine

1102
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:22,847
Keep doing

1103
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,383
A.m.

1104
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,919
19 years later

1105
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:27,967
Alex still has not had to that

1106
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:29,247
That moment

1107
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:32,575
You got into reason why is because

1108
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:33,855
He doesn't

1109
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:34,623
Mind

1110
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:35,903
This being his audience

1111
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:37,695
This is already in CityWalk

1112
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:41,791
Yeah I mean I think I've told this story before but like I was I was maybe

1113
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:44,351
Three or four years into doing stand-up and I stopped

1114
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,631
Doing a joke because

1115
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:49,727
I found out after showing somebody told me about it that they were laughing at it for the

1116
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:52,287
Complete wrong reason and I was like nope

1117
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:53,823
This is done

1118
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:56,639
Because that if that's what's funny about this

1119
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:59,455
That's not what I meant for it to be funny

1120
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:02,527
Right now if you need to keep telling the joke because

1121
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,807
Too good that you need to

1122
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:06,367
To find a way to retool it from the ground up

1123
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:09,183
In a way where that interpretation can't be

1124
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:11,487
Absolutely can't be derived from it

1125
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:16,607
Alex still wants to do this new world order Illuminati s*** and do his show

1126
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:21,983
He has a responsibility knowing that there is a heavily Nazi base

1127
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,519
Among his audience

1128
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:25,823
To present his information better

1129
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,359
It's a failing of his ability

1130
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:29,407
To present information that people

1131
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,431
Constantly r

1132
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:31,455
Quote unquote

1133
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:32,735
Confused

1134
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:34,527
If he wasn't enough

1135
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:37,343
He isn't a failure it is.

1136
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,647
Computers and he's doing exactly what he wanted to do right

1137
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:43,487
But if he were to actually a Nazi

1138
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:45,791
That would be a real shock

1139
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:46,815
To the system

1140
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,375
Now

1141
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:50,399
This is been bad

1142
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:52,191
So far

1143
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:54,239
Yeah

1144
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:56,031
Blown Away by what happened

1145
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:56,799
Towards the end

1146
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:57,567
End of this episode

1147
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:59,615
Alex gets another call

1148
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:02,943
Oh my God that is horrible Holocaust

1149
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:03,711
Survivor

1150
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:07,551
Now

1151
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,855
I take this person at their word

1152
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:15,487
Obviously well I mean you know a caller into a radio show

1153
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:19,583
Experience

1154
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:20,607
Obviously

1155
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:22,399
We will believe that this is the

1156
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,423
The truth

1157
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:25,983
She also has some bad opinion

1158
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:26,751
What's a

1159
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:29,311
South

1160
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:31,103
But

1161
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:33,919
The reason that I find this fascinating

1162
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:34,943
Is

1163
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:41,087
Alex has a person on the line who's discussing their experience

1164
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:42,623
Living through the Holocaust

1165
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:46,975
Can't stop himself from using their experience

1166
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:48,767
To push his little

1167
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,303
Narrative

1168
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,839
Who's and whose

1169
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:54,655
Snarky b******* I would kind of say

1170
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:00,543
Alex

1171
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,847
The reason I'm calling my

1172
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:05,663
It might cut my attention and was born and raised

1173
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:07,967
In Germany I was born right into the second

1174
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:08,991
World War

1175
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:11,551
And what got my attention when you mentioned

1176
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:13,599
Taking the children

1177
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:15,135
Out of their family

1178
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:19,999
Experienced another dad my grandmother when I was little

1179
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:21,535
Behead us

1180
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:22,559
Enough

1181
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,375
Station

1182
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:27,935
Train station in Alarcon

1183
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:31,007
Because they were going to put us on the truck and haul ass off

1184
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:37,407
He ended up taking us away anyway they went through a doctor and told my grandmother

1185
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,175
Capable

1186
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,199
Christopher Hart

1187
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:39,967
Indeed

1188
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:41,247
Listen to a home

1189
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:44,319
Midnight

1190
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:46,879
No I haven't noticed or here but I'm naked

1191
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,415
Shorts during the night

1192
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:49,695
Like

1193
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:53,791
It scared us

1194
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:54,815
And I haven't

1195
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:56,095
I have no

1196
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,887
The river

1197
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:58,911
Take that back

1198
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,775
Paradise kiss

1199
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:07,871
And Arthur

1200
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:13,759
For me I'm not

1201
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:15,039
My grandmother

1202
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:17,599
We had my grandmother had that Neighbors

1203
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:19,903
Crossroads

1204
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:22,207
And my grandmother told that woman he'd lyrics

1205
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:22,975
Crazy

1206
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:26,559
And she told my grandmother if you say that one more time I'm going to have

1207
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:27,839
Against the wall

1208
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:35,007
I mean I don't want to tell your grandmother

1209
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:45,759
Presuming Alex

1210
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:47,295
Believes her I would like

1211
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:50,111
I don't understand how you can behave like that

1212
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:55,487
Quite frankly someone is relaying their experience living through

1213
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:57,279
Something atrocious

1214
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:58,303
Something horrible

1215
01:02:58,815 --> 01:02:59,583
And

1216
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,143
Not get his

1217
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:06,751
And there at the end about like all criticizing Hitler means you are a Nazi

1218
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:08,287
With his victims

1219
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,567
Trying to use

1220
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:16,223
This terrifying experience from This Woman's childhood as a way to enforce

1221
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:17,247
Percy's argument against

1222
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:18,015
Arnold Schwartz

1223
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:20,575
It's bizarre

1224
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:26,975
Yeah Yeah Yeahs y me one way you could take that is thank you for helping put things in perspective

1225
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:29,023
Your grandmother's

1226
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:30,559
Spoke out against a

1227
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:33,887
Not to genocider and I just want to be a race

1228
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:36,703
And it seems like now that I have

1229
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:40,287
Heard your story I can recognize that I'm just erase

1230
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:42,335
Like Hitler

1231
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:44,127
Well it's

1232
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:46,687
That's one way to go about it

1233
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:49,759
I think that you kind of have a responsibility if

1234
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:52,575
Like someone like this calls into your show

1235
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:56,671
Your tone might want to change a little bit

1236
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,951
I think that it's

1237
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:04,607
Incredibly disrespectful that what he's essentially doing is trying to use her experience in the holler

1238
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:05,631
Cost as a prop

1239
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:06,911
AutoZone talkingpoi

1240
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:12,031
That's there's there's nothing appropriate about that

1241
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:13,567
Because it's a holocaust

1242
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:17,663
Ifucking obviously but that's f***** up to do about any person's trauma

1243
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:22,783
Yeah to exploited for your own bulshit life but it's all

1244
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:26,367
So f***** up

1245
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:31,999
About the Holocaust and it's on a show where we've already had a number of

1246
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:37,631
Absolut gluten somebody's the international Jew

1247
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:40,703
So yeah they talked a little bit more

1248
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:47,871
When I was a little girl being taken away

1249
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:49,663
For my grandmother's

1250
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:50,431
Enter

1251
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:52,479
I must have been maybe three and a half

1252
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:58,111
What happened

1253
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,135
The homework

1254
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:02,463
We were put on this

1255
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,231
Presents

1256
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,511
The cardboard

1257
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:06,559
Around their neck with her name on it

1258
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:07,327
Instruct

1259
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:09,119
Intuitive

1260
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:11,679
My brother

1261
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:13,471
Separated

1262
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,239
It's time

1263
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:16,543
Enter the phone

1264
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,103
Pranks

1265
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:22,175
Yeah I don't

1266
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,503
I don't remember that that was

1267
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:28,575
The doctor came in Denver

1268
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:30,623
Taken away anyway

1269
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:34,719
Oh my God anyway here

1270
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:43,167
My grandmother knew my grandmother stood up

1271
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:44,447
Citibank

1272
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,471
You know

1273
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:48,543
Protected us anyway she

1274
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:50,591
Possibly can

1275
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:55,199
Where's whatever

1276
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:58,015
Grandmother

1277
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:00,063
My grandmother passed

1278
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:02,111
That's the way about the

1279
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:04,671
Here's the field goal almost

1280
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,439
20 nails

1281
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:08,255
This is just hard

1282
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:10,815
It's hard to listen to

1283
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:13,375
Her relating her experience

1284
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:15,423
I'm not entirely sure I can

1285
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:16,447
Amtrak fully

1286
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:17,471
What's going on

1287
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:19,263
In the story

1288
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:20,543
There's

1289
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:23,615
Provocative images that

1290
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:28,735
Certainly come out of what she saying but I don't know what the connective tissue is the like a Beat

1291
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:30,271
Need to see it all

1292
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:34,111
Time experience occurred between when she was like

1293
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,391
3

1294
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:36,927
So yeah you can expect

1295
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:38,463
Collier

1296
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,487
Absolutely

1297
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:42,047
I just find it

1298
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:43,583
Pensive

1299
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:45,375
Basically the way Alex is

1300
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:51,263
Is taking any details that connects to a talking point of his or a little riff of his

1301
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:59,711
I mean I know Alex doesn't care because he's an anti-semite himself so he's like the Holocaust

1302
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:02,015
Or whatever it is but it is it is like

1303
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:04,319
That is not

1304
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:05,599
Not okay

1305
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:11,231
Even if it's even if you if he was at Arlington National Cemetery

1306
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:17,631
He's not going to let 700R something like that you know it's going to be like

1307
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:22,751
It is

1308
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:23,775
It is quite

1309
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,567
Crazy

1310
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:31,967
There is the responsibilities you have is a call-in talk show host to

1311
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:36,575
Seems a little bit of your presentation depending on the caller

1312
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:42,463
Like for instance if a survivor of the Holocaust calls in when you're in the middle of a deeply

1313
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:43,999
Anti-semitic show

1314
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:45,791
Freeland.

1315
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:46,815
I just

1316
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:53,471
You have a little deference. Maybe make their experience about you and your own ideas

1317
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:54,751
Spell be good

1318
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:57,823
Similarly like if you have a caller who's a kid

1319
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:00,383
Give responsibility to behave differently

1320
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:02,431
Towards that because

1321
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,199
The kid

1322
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:08,319
And Alex doesn't do that he just exploited pretty much anybody who comes into his orbit

1323
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:10,111
Even on foot

1324
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:11,903
Jerry Springer

1325
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:17,791
They treated Holocaust Survivors with a level of respect that the show had had not yet seen

1326
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:23,167
I'm not going to evacuate I haven't seen that episode I don't know what you're talkin about

1327
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:24,447
They did a great

1328
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:26,751
Sure but it was better than that

1329
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:28,031
It is

1330
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:30,079
It's hard to be much worse

1331
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:34,687
Close things out with the old news Rundown

1332
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:39,295
Just touches back on the the Willie Brown issue

1333
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:44,159
Long article on my website

1334
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,975
And it says

1335
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:48,511
Warren Willie Brown.

1336
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:49,791
Dial 911

1337
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:51,327
Mayor of Tampa

1338
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:55,679
Grandpa

1339
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:01,823
Why don't we at map

1340
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:06,687
Not incredible

1341
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,271
Chevron

1342
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:15,391
I was managed ternary

1343
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:20,767
What

1344
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,047
It seems like

1345
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:26,143
These aren't stories about Condoleezza Rice or Willie Brown

1346
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:26,911
Involving

1347
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:28,447
Foreknowledge of 9/11

1348
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:29,983
It seems like those are both

1349
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:32,287
Racist grievances of Alex's

1350
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:33,823
Yeah those are the one

1351
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:37,919
Yeah these are headlines about the two people but they are

1352
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:39,967
Anything to do

1353
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:41,759
With the story reporting to cover

1354
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:44,575
Because there is a

1355
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:46,623
Nope there's just racism

1356
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:49,439
So wild

1357
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,207
We come to the end

1358
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:53,279
Yuck

1359
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:56,095
Yak yak yak

1360
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:59,423
Do you like to go back to the past

1361
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,959
Ecstasy

1362
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:04,031
Something of an oasis something of a

1363
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:04,799
Break

1364
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:09,407
Maybe something interesting that Alex was lying about thika dig into a little bit

1365
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:13,503
But instead you see the present-day mirror

1366
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:14,783
In many ways

1367
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:16,063
Yep and it's

1368
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:17,599
Yuck

1369
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:19,135
So

1370
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,975
Brutal

1371
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:23,999
Rhoda

1372
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:28,607
Sorry I mean I suppose my only closing. So none of these people have

1373
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:29,631
Deplatform yay

1374
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:32,191
And they're still doing it for money so

1375
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:38,847
Yeah. Chris Cuomo f*** Piers Morgan Buck all the Fox News this is an interesting way that I learned the Chris

1376
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:43,199
Cuomo has a show somewhere

1377
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:52,927
It's the first amendment First Amendment

1378
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:54,975
It's been like no we don't let this happen right

1379
01:10:55,231 --> 01:11:00,351
First Amendment to give a s*** about journalism before I give a f***

1380
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:02,911
All of them

1381
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:07,007
Call comes out like.

1382
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:09,055
Yeah you show up on Infowars

1383
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:12,639
Funeral later

1384
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:15,455
But here's the problem that I that I foresee

1385
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:19,295
I think that Kanye actually represents

1386
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,575
A problem

1387
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:21,343
For Alex

1388
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:23,135
And that is

1389
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:26,719
If he comes on the show Alex has the responsibility

1390
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:29,535
You to argue with him about his antisymmetric views

1391
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:30,559
If

1392
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:32,351
If Alex is just

1393
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:33,119
Hawking

1394
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:34,911
About like an interview with

1395
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:35,935
Piers Morgan

1396
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,471
Qualms or whatever

1397
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:42,079
Key cancer control that conversation because he can use whatever Clips he wants

1398
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:45,151
Mexican Crema conversation whatever way you want Cher

1399
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:46,175
AZ has

1400
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:47,711
Kanye there

1401
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,991
And he says s***

1402
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:51,807
Can't stop him from seeing anything

1403
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:53,599
I got the 5 Seconds

1404
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:57,439
I think you talk to more than 5 Seconds

1405
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:59,743
I think it represents a problem

1406
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:02,303
Does Alex want have to

1407
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:03,839
Sort of robot bat

1408
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:05,119
Add stuff or else

1409
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:05,887
He risks

1410
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,679
You know basically

1411
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:10,239
Being overly public about his actual brand

1412
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:15,615
Until I think that Kanye is in a position where he probably would go on Infowars

1413
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:16,639
But I was kind of

1414
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:17,407
Can't let her

1415
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:18,943
Yeah

1416
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:20,479
Are you fake

1417
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:22,783
Unfortunately

1418
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:28,671
I was before I came in and we started recording I was in the alley and I saw the

1419
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:31,487
Battered and bleeding body of irony

1420
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:33,535
Because ye

1421
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:34,815
Cannot be racist

1422
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:35,839
On info

1423
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:39,167
He can be racist on Fox News

1424
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:41,215
He can be racist to everywhere

1425
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:44,543
Put on Infowars he cannot be racist

1426
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:51,967
He can go on all these other platforms and be like really extreme because they don't have a

1427
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:55,551
Predominantly extreme audience trying to pretend

1428
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:56,319
Isn't

1429
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:58,111
Alex would like

1430
01:12:58,623 --> 01:12:59,135
People with

1431
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:05,535
Nick Fuentes essentially took over the Alex Jones event

1432
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:08,095
You'd have the audience be like

1433
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:12,959
Finally Kanye's on and he's naming the enemy you know that kind of stuff

1434
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:15,519
Yeah I know you don't want you don't want to make that two transparent

1435
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:18,591
Yeah you don't to bring that into your space and risk

1436
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:19,615
Whatever damage

1437
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:20,383
Make a call to your

1438
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,919
Again the plausible deniability

1439
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:23,711
Yeah I mean I just feel like

1440
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:25,503
Sooner or later

1441
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:27,807
Alex is going to be like no one

1442
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:32,159
And everybody who does care if I was in open anti-semite

1443
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:34,207
They already hate me

1444
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:38,815
And it's not like I'm going to lose anything by doing it I'm only going to game viewers

1445
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:40,607
Going to be on there

1446
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:44,447
But I also think that there's probably a part of it that Alex

1447
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:45,215
Doesn't

1448
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:47,775
See himself as that

1449
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:48,543
So

1450
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:51,871
I mean you know my fight back against

1451
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:53,151
Sure

1452
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:55,199
That being his is

1453
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:56,991
Reality in his Public Image

1454
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:58,015
Sprite

1455
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:00,063
White Pass

1456
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,343
That's the point where it makes sense

1457
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:08,511
That does seem to be that does seem to be possible I just feel like these are going Max mask off

1458
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:10,303
I'm 6 months anyways so it's like

1459
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:12,095
Is it I mean a lot of them are now

1460
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:17,983
We're going to turn around and you're going to be like I didn't know you were a nut saying there's going to be a lot

1461
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:20,287
So I will be back

1462
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:26,687
Another episode on Friday but until then Jordan we have website

1463
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:33,087
No I'm Leo I'm the

1464
