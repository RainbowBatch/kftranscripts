1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge babe I'm sick of them posing as if

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,064
Knowledge fight

4
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,792
Joseline and

5
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,328
Just a little bit about Alex

6
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,168
Doordash

7
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,192
Heuser

8
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,216
What are you today

9
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,288
Is

10
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,056
To get a haircut

11
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:19,872
Since our last episode thank you

12
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,920
That is not the brakes

13
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,200
Bright spots

14
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:26,784
It's not bad looking at it

15
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,808
But

16
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,576
After

17
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,856
I got my haircut

18
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,392
They got to clean up the hair

19
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,720
Bright until I see this guy and he's sweeping

20
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,000
And then

21
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,048
He pulls out one of those caddy

22
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,632
The duster that's on the little stick

23
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:46,240
Look at this

24
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,312
I saw that and I thought to myself

25
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,104
I would love one of those

26
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,128
But you can

27
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,152
1:30

28
00:01:54,688 --> 00:02:00,832
I can't tell you how many times.

29
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,648
Loud house

30
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,512
All the time

31
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:14,912
So for a moment I was like yeah that'd be great but then I realized I can do you can't

32
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:19,776
It's on the way I like it

33
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:27,200
Used to work in a movie theater and you know like it was always so much easier to clean the floors at the movie theater

34
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,760
Is it home and I realized that reason why

35
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:34,112
Is it is so awful to bend down with a dustpan info

36
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,160
Or it's a real hassle to like

37
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,744
Sweep up a pile and then get out the vacuum and vacuum

38
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,024
You have that.

39
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,120
On a stick on the swivel thing stuff

40
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,144
So I have

41
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,424
Reach the

42
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:55,616
Universal laws that those can only be at businesses

43
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,176
Considered one of the I have been bending down like a

44
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,992
Idiot with one of those triangle ass

45
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,784
What am I doing

46
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,672
We have simple machines all over the place I have a computer why do I fly to my music

47
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,696
Yeah

48
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,512
We both you know I have that

49
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,328
It's a date that I think there's probably a lot of people listening

50
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:18,656
Acknowledge that they had that exact same thought that you things are only allowed in business

51
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,008
I'm not well-off enough

52
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:26,336
How to get a robot

53
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:30,176
Whatever those are called to be around

54
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,224
Cleaning robot

55
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,504
Not in the cards

56
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,272
But

57
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,552
Just being honest

58
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
That's doable

59
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:42,720
Brightspot is the British

60
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,024
Game show only connect

61
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,352
So it's like a trivia show

62
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,680
But it's not an 8U you have to know an absurd amount of trivia

63
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,704
But

64
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,752
What's interesting about the game is that it's

65
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,776
About finding the

66
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,544
Connections

67
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,312
Between

68
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,592
Pillow give you like a

69
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:02,432
Declue and then they'll give you another clue and we'll have to figure out what

70
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,712
Connects all four of these

71
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:07,040
Things that so many people have towards

72
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:10,368
Making up connections you know our brains are wired to find connect

73
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,392
And even if they aren't there

74
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,440
It can be used for good

75
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,863
Weird strange things like they might play four songs and you be like oh in Greek these all start with an I like it

76
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,911
That kind of level of Yoda

77
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,447
Yeah how specific

78
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,495
Do you have to be to combine those things

79
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,543
And it just be like three pop songs

80
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,823
And the only it up

81
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,871
An insane person be like well obviously

82
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,919
You translate the title to Greek

83
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:40,319
I bet if you do that you can see that all four of these are the same thing duh that sounds like a fun show it's really interesting

84
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:47,487
To fill that hole of contraction master

85
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,535
Cool

86
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:56,959
To take care of

87
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,239
For you

88
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,263
What does Alec

89
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,591
Common with Audrey Hepburn

90
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:07,967
I'm going to go with Permanent Vacation he's on a Roman Holiday

91
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:12,319
Holiday though

92
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:17,951
Well I was either going to say that or Breakfast at Tiffany's so he's probably having breakfast somewhere

93
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,023
Yeah he's on navigation

94
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,327
Much like Jim jarmusch

95
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,351
In 1980

96
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,935
Better use that one in.

97
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,703
Privately

98
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,239
Chevy Chase

99
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,263
1980

100
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,543
Somewhere around there

101
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:36,639
National

102
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,175
Baby

103
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,967
A good point

104
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,015
Are lawyers part of your family

105
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:43,807
Steven Hyde

106
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,623
Something

107
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,183
Infinitely frustrating about Alex

108
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,463
Stopping on airplane

109
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:54,047
I actually think it's the best thing for him and I don't

110
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:59,423
Big big picture and for the world I think it's exactly what needs to happen

111
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,471
Literally could not stop himself

112
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:07,871
From further defaming people involved in the Sandy Hook lawsuit

113
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:11,199
Could not stop himself from doing that at all

114
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,991
He clearly has a lot of

115
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:19,391
Nothing needs daycare with his lawyers Visa Avi the cases that have already happened the the Illusions about

116
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,415
Pele

117
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,463
The bankruptcy process all of this stuff

118
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,231
Julio

119
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:28,095
Requires a ton of attention

120
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,887
I mean he doesn't have a deep bench

121
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,679
There's not a lot of people that can

122
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,447
Can fill in

123
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:38,335
You can clearly see the drop-off in in viewership on Van. Video the episodes where Owen toast

124
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,663
It's unfortunate

125
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,687
Demonic

126
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,455
That are going to come

127
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,271
I know it is what needs to happen

128
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,087
And probably this is when you need a big-name signing

129
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,879
And you know this is like when Alex

130
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,903
Need to go out

131
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:56,511
And get I get you know like you can't get a star but get somebody on the rise

132
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,047
That has some of that

133
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,095
You know some of that

134
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,631
Cuz Owens not going to do

135
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:08,031
Here is actually I think probably where you regret not paying Rodger Stone during the downtime that's a good

136
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,591
That's a good point

137
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:16,991
Frank's speech and I think it is blast I heard I believe you streaming on Nick Fuentes platform couple damn

138
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:17,759
Yeah and snow

139
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,527
Is the devil

140
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:22,111
Stone could be the type of person that you maybe get to

141
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,135
Phelan hearing

142
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,695
Maybe he has enough cash

143
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,791
Text didn't do enough maintenance of their relationship and now he's

144
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,839
Gone off to other places

145
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,863
His primary

146
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,215
About home

147
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,751
Here's what we'll do

148
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,519
Okay

149
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,543
If I'm Alex

150
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,359
I'm throwing I'm throwing it to the Four Winds

151
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,383
And I'm sad

152
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,271
I will open the pocketbook for a stone pieczenik two-man show everyday

153
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,831
Flowers

154
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:58,463
I would actually I mean couldn't take the place of the alley

155
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:04,351
That a good show would be Norman Barnes

156
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,887
But only if they are

157
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:10,495
Actively and openly hate each other as much as they apparently did I would be good

158
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,543
The two of them yelling at each other

159
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,311
I think that could be

160
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:17,919
Before like one of those Sports argument shows but it's just the two of them and it's about

161
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:23,039
Their personal lives like they're just their grievances of towards each other yet

162
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,319
Comedy Workshop

163
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,599
I think it'd be fun

164
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,671
I'm just talkin about jokes as working on

165
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,975
So we could be fun

166
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:36,607
You've been reading a lot about Kanye lately

167
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,911
Fight the urge

168
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,335
But I can't engage

169
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,639
But it's no perfect timing

170
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,455
Insurance would be moments

171
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:55,807
We're well conservative would have come in handy

172
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,343
Norm sold

173
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,367
Kanye woke

174
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
Insurance

175
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,415
Norwood on parlor

176
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:03,743
That's how big of a claim he's got right there

177
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:10,143
So yeah we're in a situation where Alex is still out of Studio things to do

178
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,727
4

179
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:15,775
Let's say hello

180
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:20,127
Does new walk Melissa okay thank you so much and I apologize

181
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:26,271
Hunter is a party I'd husky

182
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,087
Thank you very much

183
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,975
Thank you very much

184
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:41,119
Next the foundation to repair Alex Jones's daughters broke

185
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:47,519
Thank you very much just $0.30 a day you can send someone to a waterpark

186
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,079
I feel like there's just

187
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,615
An image of

188
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,407
T-Pain with no one fish

189
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,967
Fishing very moment now

190
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,807
This sunnex person gave me a phonetic spelling but it doesn't help

191
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:04,927
Let me ask you this how do you pronounce c h k a

192
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,975

00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,743
Ka

194
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,655
Phonetically

195
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,447
I do appreciate

196
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:23,871

So thank you so much to Joe from Oregon thinks Jordan and I are f****** amazing and I accept as well Aaron Copland

200
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,071

201
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,215
Someone someone sodomites

202
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,359
Has a Caribbean

203
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,455
Little little

204
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,247
I don't want

205
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,039
Jesus Christ

206
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:07,647
Thank you so much you sneaky snake

207
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,719
Did they force us to accept a compliment

208
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,999
I feel like that is

209
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:12,767
This is one of the

210
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,327
Ultimate the third rails of our show

211
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,631
It's it's konflict

212
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,679
Yes but thank you all the same

213
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:23,519
So Jordan it's come to my attention

214
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
That

215
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,591
No we talked a lot

216
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,871
About Alex

217
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,895
Path towards

218
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:33,759
Trump certainly read it number of episodes about it to the 2015 scratch

219
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,831
We never actually covered Trump's interview

220
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,623
On Alex's show

221
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:43,231
Alright I believe didn't wish it wasn't the rationale at the time like

222
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,023
It really wasn't that interesting

223
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,583
Wasn't as interesting

224
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,863
To the path

225
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,191
Supporting trop

226
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,471
The Pizza Co

227
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,263
And then

228
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,031
App that

229
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:00,639
Time on our show you had this standing policy of never listening to Trump

230
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,407
Voice

231
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:05,247
And so there was also a part of it that was like

232
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,527
I don't know I don't want to

233
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:12,927
Make Jordan listen to this yeah and so that was something that was never covered and

234
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:17,279
Why were there now 740i episodes

235
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,583
You know is Alice's on

236
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,607
It might be time

237
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375
To look back

238
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,911
I think it's a great idea

239
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,983
That will say I turned off this episode

240
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,263
At a certain point

241
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,055
That's fair and that is because

242
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,103
There's a bit of b*******

243
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,383
Trump interview

244
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,919
There's mother Bull Shed

245
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:36,479
And then Alex is like I'm going to interview Lord monckton

246
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,503
And I said click

247
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:42,367
No thank you I'm not really all that interested in that weirdo

248
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,415
I mean it's just going to be like I'll climb

249
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,743
A change isn't real look at me I'm weird

250
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:52,863
Today that the UN has put out a report been like remember when we said 20-30 it's

251
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,911
Now tomorrow 30

252
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,935
Bye

253
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:02,335
Faster I don't want to hear somebody denied climate change you know how we said 20-30 that was actually military time

254
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,407
2 nights

255
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:12,063
Lord Montague and I'll go a parachute back into a un conference for publicity Scott

256
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,599
The f*** out of here but

257
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,391
We are going to take

258
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159
Little bit

259
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
One of the things

260
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,743
It's really fun

261
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,791
Is that at the beginning of the episode

262
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
Alex

263
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,607
Will not say who the gas state

264
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,167
Okay I got a big d right all right

265
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,703
If you really prepared for the

266
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,127
Really worried about

267
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,255
Gremlin snafus

268
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,279
You don't want any G

269
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,559
No certain

270
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,887
Now he's so much worse than a regular snapper

271
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,935
You do want Gremlins to snafu

272
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,471
That's slightly funny

273
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:37,055
You want the Gremlins to commit snack food

274
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,383
They want you want their situation

275
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,919
Yeah it was normal

276
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,735
Spiders

277
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,343
So he's not saying who the interview is

278
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,135
We know

279
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,415
England

280
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,439
Alex dose

281
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:59,583
He spent so much time preparing

282
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,423
What could you possibly think of in terms of questions for Donna

283
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
Trump

284
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,239
In an hour that you wouldn't

285
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:11,615
Having 3 hours you know what I'm saying is not 3 hours of preparation preparation

286
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
But

287
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,223
Here's where things get a little bit

288
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:16,991
Shady

289
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,039
Pretty quick as it turns out

290
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,599
Or at least

291
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:25,183
Almost all of the headlines that Alex covers

292
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,463
In the lead-up

293
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,999
Two before the interview happens

294
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:32,607
Or about how great Rhonda course they are course there is one of them

295
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:36,447
Okay

296
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,991
So that Trump has

297
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:53,087
Vindicated on that spool get to that a little bit later but yeah that's one of the big news item

298
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,647
Being presented

299
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,463
Without the context of

300
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:02,303
Trump will be on later this just a new style my God

301
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,071
Saturday

302
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:06,911
The battery is almost like a winking Easter egg

303
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:10,751
Type thing while at the same time being so sycophantic that it is

304
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,519
Like

305
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,287
It hurts

306
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,055
Like it hurts

307
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:16,895
And it's not that's not the only headline Trump

308
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:28,671
Cheddar's restaurant

309
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,231
Trump is right yes you were wondering Trump is right about everything

310
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,023
Hahaha

311
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,863
Quite a setup

312
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:41,215
Yeah you know we got Trump is going to be coming on although you know this is

313
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,495
Isn't going to be

314
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,519
Sure

315
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,287
The

316
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,311
DD.

317
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,103
Metaphorically speaking

318
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,895
Is

319
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,431
Is what we're saying right here

320
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,735
Yeah and David Knight

321
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,503
Going to be hosting

322
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,527
The 4th hour

323
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,295
You better believe

324
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,343
We talkin about this interview

325
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:03,743
On the 4th hour we got to tease the fourth hour that will be talking about the interview that we're about to do

326
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,559
That's too crazy

327
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,607
Where you can audit

328
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,535
So we're doing this

329
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,559
To be explosive

330
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:15,679
Cool but also pisses preemptively it offensively navel-gazing

331
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,519
We haven't done the interview yet

332
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:25,407
But holyshit will we be covering the people responding to the interview that we're about to

333
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,943
Yeah you know

334
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,711
I mean

335
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,783
I feel like what we are

336
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,807
Listening to

337
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,879
Would if it were Trump being so

338
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,903
Foolish it

339
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:36,927
You know like

340
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:43,583
Fine I get it stop your window pull the windows down tell everybody to turn it down for get on the right there

341
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,119
Unless our context before

342
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,143
But because

343
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,423
This is Trump

344
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,215
I think what it is is so

345
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,751
Very clear

346
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,287
How these two

347
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,823
Know how to game the media

348
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:54,847
For their own

349
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,663
I mean it's just so obvious

350
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:04,063
Well point it's obvious and crafts but I mean to the point where Alex is already gone

351
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,111
The headlines

352
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,159
That they're going to write

353
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,719
You know like this is one of those few moments where

354
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:14,047
Trump and Alex both we're like it we're going to do this and then

355
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:20,959
You write the headlines before they're they're drop they're going to be what you think they're going to be at there's a media savviness

356
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,727
Do it there

357
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:24,031
Clearly indicating awareness

358
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,311
Yeah

359
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,335
It's like

360
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:32,479
I'm fascinated by the way that Alec seems to be reassuring the audience

361
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,551
That they will cover the coverage of Their Own

362
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,575
Yeah it's

363
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,391
Yeah no s***

364
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:42,719
Yeah we're not going to

365
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,743
But also

366
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,279
Shouldn't we be more

367
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,071
Interested in the interview itself

368
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,607
As opposed to

369
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,375
David Knight

370
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,655
Covering the backlash

371
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,423
Do the interview

372
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,959
I think I think

373
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:56,031
It would be a situation where if

374
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,567
If that was

375
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,103
The interview happening

376
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,383
On 911

377
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,663
David knightwood

378
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,479
Still cover the interview at 9.

379
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,527
Well it seems like they have equal measure

380
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,855
Right-to-die interview itself

381
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,647
And how people are going to respond

382
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,927
To the interview

383
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,487
I am prior to the interview happening at the

384
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,047
Yeah

385
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,351
Yeah but it is it is

386
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,631
Clear though that they're like

387
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,423
No one cares what we

388
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,191
We say

389
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:27,775
This is not about we're going to say something of any value

390
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:29,823
Real

391
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,359
Is your on this show

392
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,407
And by doing that we know what

393
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,199
People are going to respond

394
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,991
And it's going to be close

395
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,039
Yeah so Trump polls

396
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,599
And also all these headlines

397
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,367
Like I said

398
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,135
All just

399
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,623
This is

400
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,647
Maybe

401
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,672
Sketchy

402
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,328
When you know the Trump is about to come on the show and you're not disclosing that while you cover this as news

403
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,632
Yeah that seems like a folder

404
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,680
Disclosure kind of thing you need to

405
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,728
The I don't know I find

406
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,496
This to be a little weird

407
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,056
If we were talking about a real new show

408
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,080
If they were to

409
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:34,848
To do this

410
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,872
It would be

411
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,896
Disgrace

412
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,200
Well they might not have

413
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,480
Dimension like

414
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,760
Okay also this person

415
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:48,160
I'm coming up the interview would be advertised on tuning in would know that the person was going to be on the show

416
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:53,024
Because otherwise this feels like apropos of nothing here's all these great Trump headlines

417
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,792
That's

418
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,560
That's what

419
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,864
So clear about it though is again

420
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,704
They know that nothing about what they say is going to have a

421
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,776
What do we have to say we don't have words that makes sense

422
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,544
To each other

423
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,568
We're just going to go

424
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,360
At each other and then

425
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:11,200
What's important though is that people are going to say stuff about it

426
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,272
There is a little bit less than you think probably

427
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,832
2020

428
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,624
To understanding of trump

429
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,160
A communication

430
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,184
And it is really

431
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,744
Libras are till I see this in 2015 like

432
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,280
Communicative

433
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,304
More coherently

434
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:32,704
Pinterest use a little bit all over the place still there's a speedy list

435
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,240
Negative thoughts and what have you put like

436
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,776
Compare to what you

437
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,568
See if he's Rally's now like

438
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,104
So little it's quite

439
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,176
Different hanging out being present it does take its toll on everybody

440
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,200
Yeah

441
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,992
It manifests in different ways

442
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,272
I'm so

443
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,576
The news has broken

444
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,112
Of Alex's interview

445
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,136
He's giving the

446
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:51,904
Exclusive

447
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,184
Do the Drudge Report

448
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,208
Because of course

449
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:54,976
Of course

450
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,616
Morgan

451
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,968
Drudgereport.com

452
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,624
Do you have the news of the interview is as important as the interview

453
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,184
It's very strange.

454
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:25,952
Yeah

455
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:26,976
Yeah

456
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,256
I mean but that's

457
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,608
That's one of those things where

458
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:37,216
Iei you if it's so obvious what they want

459
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,264
I feel like I'm being tired

460
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,056
Media structure has to be like

461
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:41,824
No

462
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:42,848
No

463
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,408
You know everybody has to agree that this

464
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:48,736
This is just we're not going to be treated like this you know like

465
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,272
Because if they're going to

466
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,040
Sport you

467
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:57,440
So obviously they're going to say it on air before you do the thing that they're going to make you do right

468
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:03,328
Then f****** you or you're the loser years apart but to me that it is such a

469
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,864
Difficult line

470
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,704
Because like I know what you're saying but at the same time how do you not

471
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,032
Bring up that someone who is running for president was on

472
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,312
F****** Infowars

473
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,360
You know like how do you not cover that

474
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:19,456
It's the same thing like for us we're like Marjorie Taylor Greene was on

475
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,480
With Alex

476
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:26,368
They were joking around but she's obviously like

477
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,672
Ploy for attention and what have you brought

478
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,696
How do you not

479
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:32,256
Talkabouttd

480
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,816
Violently rhetorical

481
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,608
Member of Congress

482
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,376
Eaze

483
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,936
On Infowars

484
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:45,312
Regularity on Infowars

485
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,360
But yeah it's

486
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,384
It's there how do you

487
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,712
You talk about this stuff without playing into the game of giving them the attempt

488
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:52,992
I think so

489
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,040
Clearly are Desperately Seeking

490
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,576
Spratly seek

491
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:59,392
I'm not sure exactly what you do but you can do that

492
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:00,928
Don't think that

493
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,208
Coverage of Alex

494
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,488
I haven't Trump on this

495
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,256
Sincerely

496
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,328
Let's say that

497
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,608
As far as the past

498
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,376
Disconcern

499
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,912
No one's getting offline

500
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,984
You know like let's not worry too much about

501
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,008
Exact

502
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:15,776
Apportion

503
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:19,616
And let's just say that everything that happened over the past day 10 years

504
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,152
We all need to fix

505
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,968
Some s*** some get off later than others but

506
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:24,736
So Alex

507
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,016
Introduces Trump

508
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,576
That's a bit askisi

509
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,368
But if you pay attention

510
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,952
Feels a little bit like the way that Alex

511
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,000
Can talk about Trump is like guys

512
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:36,768
It's really about me

513
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,672
New York City

514
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,728
To be with you

515
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,752
Great

516
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:24,128
Yeah busy to talk about Trump

517
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:30,272
Achievement says they're also said only one way to say this guy's Gray

518
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,552
I'm great

519
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:35,136
And this is why I'm excited to talk to him cuz he reminds me of me

520
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:42,816
You like an old me do I not really

521
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:45,632
You know I really

522
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,936
We both pretend to be self-made and we both

523
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:51,008
Talk a lot of s*** both malignant narcissist

524
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:58,688
So we get too into this interview by talking about the ways in which Trump was Vindicated

525
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:05,600
You talked about the celebrations of 911 this comes up and it's just all

526
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,368
Load of s***

527
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,512
People wanted me to apologize and we can't

528
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:22,496
Braiding

529
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:20,608
Trump Vindicated in his claims and people booing at a soccer game or saying I'll Akbar has nothing to do with me

530
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:25,472
Volumes that he made so leave that aside it's a b Quintanilla

531
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:29,312
And if you want to say like during a moment of silence people shouldn't do anything

532
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,848
Then that's fine but

533
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,384
Making it a little bit Target

534
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,456
So what happened was

535
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:41,344
Completely inaccurate and then instead of admitting that he was wrong he pretended he'd made a completely different claim all the

536
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:48,512
He initially said quote I watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down and I watched in Jersey City New Jersey

537
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,792
C worth thousands and thousands

538
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,816
The people were cheering

539
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,608
Has the building was coming down

540
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,144
Thousands of people were cheering

541
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,168
So something

542
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,216
Things going on we've got to find out what it is

543
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,384
A Washington Post article from around 9:11 does mention unverified claims a small amount of people allegedly celebrate

544
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,408
Waiting on a rooftop

545
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,968
But there's no video evidence of this ever happened

546
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:11,040
Reporters have estimated that it was maybe six

547
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,320
212 teenagers

548
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,088
Quote but

549
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,368
Even that is doubtful

550
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:15,648
So

551
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:18,208
That could be what is a video

552
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,768
Anyway at this point when I was interviewing him

553
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,560
The goalposts have completely moved

554
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:25,120
And Trump has declared that he would

555
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:25,888
Because someone

556
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,448
Find video of Palestinians celebrating in the ark

557
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,472
Occupied West Bank

558
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:34,592
This is not what company claimed people were saying he was making up

559
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:38,688
This is the state of things at this point and Trump is not at all vintage

560
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,760
Also Alex should be really against

561
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,808
Trump's idea of surveilling mosques

562
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,112
That seems wildly against out

563
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,184
The principles about freedom of religion in the Fourth Amendment but I guess

564
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,464
You don't really care about those

565
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,232
Think too much RAM

566
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,768
The group being targeted to someone of the

567
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,560
Do you have Trump

568
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:58,400
Essentially arguing for increased surveillance in a way that Alec

569
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,168
Alex Wood

570
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,192
The cry is

571
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:03,520
Tyranny in any other context

572
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,056
Giving any pushback

573
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,080
He's just right along with

574
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,688
You should have stayed up for hours

575
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:14,016
Stealing his a result

576
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:17,088
But to be able to push back in the service setting

577
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:20,160
You know it's like whatever I

578
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:20,928
Here

579
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,696
Trump speak

580
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:22,976
I feel like

581
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:26,304
What I'm what I'm experiencing is like

582
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,584
Best for a time-trap like

583
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,352
Here's what

584
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:30,912
Time traveler went back in time

585
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:31,936
Assad Trump

586
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:36,800
Talkin there was like well there's no reason to worry about this a****** fence guys

587
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,872
Is Nick clearly not going to cause problems he's just a moron

588
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:42,176
The everybody will be able to see through

589
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:44,992
Such clear b******* everyone

590
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,016
See through

591
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,040
Clear bulshit

592
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,576
It's transparent

593
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,976
Right but then he goes back to the future and it turns out Trump did everything they did so they let it stay

594
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,512
As a training a

595
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,328
Exercise for all future time traveler it was okay

596
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,632
Listen here's what you think

597
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,168
You think this guy can't hurt you

598
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,264
That's why we tired

599
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,312
F*** these Time Travelers man

600
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,360
What are they doing I don't know

601
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:14,176
I didn't start the agency bad

602
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,736
They need to go back in time and fix this

603
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:19,808
Training exercises go back in time

604
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,856
But update have to make another training

605
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,904
Exercise

606
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:25,696
Dido

607
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,464
So what

608
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,256
Do you think Trump thinks the number one problem is

609
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:32,608
Emigrate

610
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:37,216
Masonry Borders or something like that

611
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,776
People Muslims 10 blocks

612
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,016
Didn't want to say it

613
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:54,112
But you look at what's happening where we have a president served over there celebrating

614
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:02,048
Our number one problem we are number one problem

615
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,448
Number one

616
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:22,016
Just happened there

617
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:29,440
Appearance on Alex's show has to also be understood through the prism of trump was on a book sale

618
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:31,232
Campaign at this time

619
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,816
Is also a promotional stop

620
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:35,840
For him to push his

621
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,144
Does

622
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,936
Do his job

623
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:46,336
At a certain number of times brings up the book in order to try and sell it

624
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:52,736
I'm standing on the sidewalk and a Segway just slammed into me and knocked me to the ground and then I'm in the middle of the street that's what

625
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:55,552
Just happened there I pride myself on Segways

626
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,320
I sometimes

627
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:59,136
Do some pretty good work a knife

628
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,416
Not all of them like

629
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,512
No one's perfect

630
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:10,912
The number to process was unfortunate the freezing of that

631
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:13,728
I don't think I would be thrilled with

632
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:20,128
The alleged plans of Muslims to blow up our country is the number one problem in the problem is your book

633
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:23,456
That's the number to problem

634
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,760
Trump

635
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,040
So

636
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,600
Trump

637
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:33,696
Oh I'm sure he's at

638
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,000
This should also infuriate Alex

639
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:47,520
America we deserve and identity

640
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,768
Nasty

641
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,008
You better take him out

642
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,976
Naturally this is bulshit

643
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:44,864
Bin Laden was a well-known quantity by the time Trump put out this book in January 2000

644
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:51,264
Mostly because he was an international terrorist leader and he bombed the World Trade Center in 1993

645
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,848
Just pretend that he hadn't already bombed the same place

646
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:58,944
Trump's claim that he was a little-known figure is absurd

647
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,552
Also fact-check review Trump's book any didn't say any of this s*** in it

648
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:06,112
This is the only mention he makes a bin Laden

649
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:06,880
I'm in the entire book

650
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:13,280
Instead of one looming crisis hanging over us we face it bewildering series of smaller crisis

651
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:15,584
Flashpoint standoffs in hotspots

652
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:18,912
We're not playing the chess games and I'll chess games anymore

653
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,448
We're playing tournament chess

654
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,240
One master against many rides

655
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:29,152
One day we're all assuming that a rock is under control the UN inspectors have done their work everything's fine not to worry

656
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,432
The next day the bombings

657
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,200
Begin

658
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:37,600
One day we're told that shadowy figure with no fixed address named Osama bin Laden

659
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:40,416
US jet fighters lay waste to his camp in Afghanistan

660
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,952
He escapes back under some rock

661
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,000
And if you knew Cycles later

662
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,792
He's onto a new enemy and a new crisis

663
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,328
Fat pussies

664
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,864
Mentionables

665
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,888
Maybe

666
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,192
Lying about the contacts

667
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:52,960
Text another sin

668
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,776
I don't I don't understand

669
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:56,800
Fundamental

670
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,592
How human being

671
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,384
Could listen to

672
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,408
Someone as in

673
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,176
Insane is Trump

674
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:04,480
Say if people would listen to me

675
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,016
We would have stopped 9/11

676
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,040
And not go

677
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,320
Oh that guy's insane

678
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,368
I don't get it

679
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,392
I just don't

680
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:13,440
Understand anyway

681
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,744
That you could listen to that man

682
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,584
Say that he could have stopped 9/11 if everybody just listen to him

683
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,864
And think o

684
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:27,264
Insane person that needs to go away for a long time spoiler alert Nugent is on later.

685
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:33,920
Maybe she predict 911 tail but maybe he implies that he could have stopped at all costs

686
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:37,248
Okay alright these guys also

687
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:40,832
There's another problem here Beyond Trump has been full of s*** about his book

688
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:44,160
Alex should strongly disagree with Trump's prediction

689
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:49,024
Alex doesn't think the bin Laden was The Mastermind of 911 and if anything Trump make

690
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,048
Kind of prediction

691
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:55,424
Should be evidence that he was in on the attempt to set up Bin Laden as the villain after the globalist

692
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,448
Did 9/11

693
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:02,848
Of course none of this is addressed in Trump's ridiculous claim but nobody really knew Bin Laden wasn't 2000 goes on challenge

694
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,616
Because Alex

695
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,920
Isn't in the business of actually gauge

696
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,456
Anything that Trump says

697
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,016
And how it's clearly contradictory to

698
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,296
Who pretend worlds

699
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,368
DD amount of

700
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,136
Time

701
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,160
That

702
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,184
I have spent

703
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:18,720
Like

704
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,768
Not understanding why we don't

705
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,328
Continuously talk about how bin Laden

706
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,120
Hit the World Trade Center twice

707
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,936
Like that is the ultimate

708
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,728
Return to the scene of the crime

709
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:33,824
Situation do you know what I'm saying like

710
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,616
Enough

711
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,896
Like it you know it

712
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,432
It doesn't get more than that

713
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,736
And yet people are still like 911

714
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,040
Anytime

715
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,576
Any terrorism is ever happen

716
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,368
Eventbrite you know

717
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:49,696
Are we doing here sure

718
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,464
As party

719
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,000
The contextualizing of

720
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,280
Of the story

721
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:55,840
And it's also undercuts a lot of this like

722
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,888
How could anybody have

723
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:00,704
Possibly even talked about bin Laden

724
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,472
Yeah

725
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:05,568
But the reality is what it is exploding is that

726
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:12,224
It is fair enough to say that prior to 9/11 Osama Bin Laden wasn't necessarily a name that was on everybody's

727
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:16,320
Somebody who is a household name that everybody was talking

728
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,344
Sing about

729
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,392
The exploited

730
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:23,744
To claim that no one knew who he was or he was like

731
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,048
Obscure figure is

732
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,072
Ridiculous

733
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,400
That's a fun game

734
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:34,496
Alex brings up that Trump knows

735
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:38,848
This is good news today now in 2022

736
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,432
It's not really well

737
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:45,504
But there is something that does

738
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:52,160
It is probably a large part of the interview that I didn't cut his money clips of

739
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:56,512
From the Middle East oil fields

740
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,584
So people that he doesn't like can't make money office

741
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:08,800
32 years ago

742
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:22,368
Number one

743
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:46,432
And I will probably get along well with him

744
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,088
Recently

745
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:04,352
Find a tough cookie but

746
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,656
She'll probably get along with him or someone else will

747
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:08,704
Yeah

748
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:13,824
Answer answer is more important than Trump

749
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,360
Really was at that time

750
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,896
Obsessed with the idea of pillage

751
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:22,016
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

752
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:24,064
That's a real that's a real life

753
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,856
Oh you're a small boy

754
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:28,160
You're a very small boy if you think that

755
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:31,232
Viking times are the Pinnacle of civilization

756
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,792
Leave the premise of

757
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,328
The Iraq War

758
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,864
Ostensibly is that

759
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,400
You know you had this

760
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,936
Tyrant who was in power

761
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,984
Yeah and so we're helping

762
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,800
Overthrow the tyrant in order to bring

763
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,592
A democratic state

764
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:52,992
Into existence threat to Regional neighbors and the world stability of the whole

765
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:58,368
That mission is not served by stealing all of their resources right

766
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,904
That seems like

767
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,440
Something else

768
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,256
Counterfeit

769
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:09,888
Idea

770
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,424
And then

771
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,984
We will all have somewhere to ice skate

772
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,800
He would really Serve the People

773
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,896
To free from this dictatorship if we

774
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:21,664
Took their oil

775
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:26,016
You understand that the

776
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:30,368
What are you going to do turn Iraq into at the 51st state

777
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:35,488
You're like that's what we're going to do will your belongings real lack of

778
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,280
Concern for the actual people

779
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,048
Of course

780
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:38,816
Of the region

781
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:44,448
A little too obvious this plan there's only They're All Dead

782
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:47,520
Alex has some

783
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:52,640
Interesting points here one is that he believes the Trump is a manifestation of this war

784
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:53,919
What's going on behind the scene

785
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,967
Switch is the counter counter-coup

786
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:57,503
Steve pieczenik

787
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,039
Been talking about it this time

788
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,575
Which is very reminiscent

789
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:04,671
Proto Q qanon ideas that were going around

790
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:07,487
Even before the creation of that

791
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:08,767
Eyehole

792
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,047
Nothing

793
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:12,863
Whatever was Alex expresses this

794
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,399
The Trump is like

795
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:17,983
You know these people behind-the-scenes good people in government brought him into

796
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:18,751
To do this

797
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:19,775
Mission

798
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:21,567
But

799
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,103
There's another preoccupation

800
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:25,919
So Trump is preoccupied with stealing oil

801
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:28,479
Is preoccupied with

802
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:32,319
Please reassure me that you're not f****** around

803
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:36,671
Please just tell me that you're not going to Ross Perot this thing

804
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,207
And there's

805
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,255
A little bit of dodging of quest

806
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:04,063
What you're doing

807
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,551
I love I love

808
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:46,303
In Mobile Alabama 35,000 people in Oklahoma

809
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:59,871
Make America great again

810
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,647
And we can make

811
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:18,559
But we have to get going

812
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,935
Agreed with me on a rack I said

813
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,215
AOL

814
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,623
Cockroaches

815
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,495
The first election

816
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,287
For George Washington

817
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,823
Like it was pretty much

818
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:08,223
Not even a losing election for a vice-president but not really for the president

819
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:11,807
You're practically forced him to be president many times he was like

820
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:15,903
I don't know if I'm actually a president guy unless you're arguing

821
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:22,559
The John Adams being his vice president is the most important the most important election

822
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,095
Decide

823
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,655
I don't think the questions answered

824
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:27,679
You know like

825
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,215
Are you going to Ross Perot it

826
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,263
I haven't decided yet

827
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:33,311
I love these real

828
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:36,127
Spotify

829
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:36,895
I've enjoyed

830
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,175
This I could do other things

831
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:42,015
Certainly the ideas that I'm saying I believe are important

832
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:44,575
There's no reassurance

833
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,599
But Alex is looking for

834
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:48,159
It would be at would I would

835
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:52,767
Be interested to know if there was a moment where you could talk to Trump in

836
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:56,351
Like go back time travel wise one more time if there's a moment where you

837
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,631
You can talk to Trump in like

838
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:00,191
Early 2016 and just be like list

839
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:02,495
If you keep

840
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:04,031
Campaigning for president

841
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:06,079
You can do all of the Rally's

842
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:10,175
All the time everyone will give you all the Adoration that you want

843
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:12,735
Right but if you become president

844
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:14,527
Inside that room

845
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:17,855
Ya Romance

846
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:20,671
You don't get adoration people people are going

847
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:24,511
Be even more critical of the pig

848
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:27,071
The people around you are going to think you're a child

849
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,607
If you keep doing rallies

850
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:34,239
Could talk s*** talkingshit

851
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,543
Cuz that's what he wanted

852
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,335
That's what he's always wanted

853
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:40,127
I don't know how you would do that

854
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:40,895
Necessarily

855
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:43,711
Like Perpetual campaign

856
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:47,295
But you got me mad face

857
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:53,695
I am not good at this job thing

858
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,999
I like it when people scream my name

859
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,791
If only there was some sort of a middle ground

860
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:04,191
We could have reached where you could have all pretended that you want

861
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,495
Absolutely

862
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:10,847
Assurance he was looking for on the pro question

863
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,407
And so he tries to do it again

864
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,511
Author Rodger

865
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:43,103
New York

866
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:56,927
I know you're

867
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:27,135
Omigod omigod

868
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:30,207
Wasn't quite a reassurance either

869
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:33,279
Alex is really desperately just trying to be like

870
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:34,559
Just play

871
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,327
Please like this

872
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,887
Stumbling blocks for the audience

873
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,167
The audience

874
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,191
It when I say

875
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:41,215
Someday

876
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:42,495
Tractors have said this

877
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,519
I'm sitting at this is one

878
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,287
The criticism

879
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,711
In order to get them over that hurdle

880
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:53,503
Yeah I mean we already

881
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,527
Listen Alex

882
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,295
Here's what

883
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,087
Okay when you're a billionaire

884
00:48:57,343 --> 00:49:01,439
If I want something then I go to a politician and I pay them

885
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,207
To give it

886
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:10,911
Of course of course I'm a guy I am an oligarch I meant above politics

887
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,447
I just want to kill all of you

888
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:14,239
Like that

889
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,055
Has asthma

890
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,079
German

891
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,407
I did business

892
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:27,807
I got to do the business hours and like I have to f*** with these people in all of us just go well then the system should

893
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:28,575
Stop

894
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,879
Is this

895
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:38,047
Great point should maybe put back-on based on his worldview

896
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,327
Is just a acceptable

897
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:02,367
Unbelievable

898
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:11,839
Because

899
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:18,751
Argument

900
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:56,127
Alex is like alright

901
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:58,431
You're not answering this question let me go ahead

902
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:03,807
Finish it off for you I'm going to the question for you now also I stayed up for 3 hours

903
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,855
I wanted to question that I came up with

904
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,135
Who's your favorite person

905
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,159
Who's your favorite

906
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:11,231
Most obvious question

907
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:15,327
Are you considering as a running mate also wrote down

908
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,119
Sandwiches

909
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:24,543
Yay or nay or outside the bread

910
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:29,151
Outside in the bread on the inside sandwich or not

911
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,687
Billboard

912
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:35,551
Extensive debate

913
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:37,855
Good question

914
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,647
Chili soup

915
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:41,951
What's the cold soup called

916
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:42,975
Bouillabaisse

917
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:46,047
Gazpacho

918
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:46,815
Disgusting

919
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:50,399
So we get to know answer on the question of the running

920
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:52,447
Make sure you get some rambling around

921
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:54,751
And then we learned about the favorite present

922
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:57,311
Skip you're here probably maybe respond

923
00:51:57,567 --> 00:52:01,663
So I would

924
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:03,711
Okay cuz Alice's response

925
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:06,015
To the answer of who's your favorite President

926
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:06,783
Is

927
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:07,551
Shocking

928
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,319
Okay

929
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,839
What's going on

930
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:07,967
Make America great again

931
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:12,831
Alex thinks the Reagan's a secret communist I was going to say once it's not like

932
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:16,671
Alright buddy

933
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:17,695
That is

934
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:22,047
I overheard Alex talk about so many presidents and not once

935
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,327
Has he been like you know Reagan was

936
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,095
Who's the best president

937
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,887
I understand

938
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:29,471
Certainly has probably grown and appreciation for Reagan

939
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,239
In the last

940
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,007
B

941
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:33,055
But yeah that's not

942
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:34,335
Inline with Alex's

943
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:36,639
Sort of regular consistent

944
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:42,015
View view Reagan as being the the

945
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:44,575
Terminator 2 of ending the New Deal

946
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:49,951
Then I suppose you would grow in appreciation for him as the New Deal continues to disappear

947
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:50,975
Get out

948
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:52,255
Riggins only

949
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:55,839
Gaming in popularity as we all discover that he

950
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:58,143
He's dismantled the entire country from the top down

951
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,679
Sprout

952
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:02,239
It's a great answer for Trump I guess I mean

953
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,007
Sort of

954
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:09,663
In line with Obama

955
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,199
What year

956
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:11,967
Expect from Trump

957
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:12,991
So it's

958
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,015
5

959
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:14,783
But for Alex

960
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:15,807
Poop

961
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:16,575
That's not okay

962
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,343
No

963
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,367
No no no no

964
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:21,183
Give me the favorite present

965
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:25,535
Eisenhower now you can't be like you can't what

966
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,839
Well I like that speech

967
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:31,167
No but I mean you can talk to the guy at the center of all that never

968
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:35,263
He's also a secret

969
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:40,383
All of them are present

970
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:42,943
So Alex it turns out

971
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,991
The pastor Trump is

972
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:46,271
Complicated

973
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:48,575
As we discovered there were a lot of

974
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:50,111
Clear influences

975
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:53,695
A lot of Steve pieczenik influence a lot of Rogers

976
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:57,023
But there was one that we didn't account for and that is Alex's

977
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:58,047
13 year olds

978
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:58,815
Sunrise

979
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:01,119
Who

980
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:26,719
I would say

981
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:58,463
F****** book report that was never finished

982
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:05,119
My favorite song you got to go with Pride and Prejudice that's classic contact book

983
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:08,191
You look at president to look at Lincoln and Washington

984
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:12,287
Someone coach today Jefferson Davis

985
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,311
Like that

986
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:21,247
That inspires absolutely no confidence in somebody having opinions about

987
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,551
There are feelings

988
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:26,367
Totally like you don't know anything about

989
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:30,463
American history whatsoever beyond the lore that you make up in your own

990
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:33,279
Probably hoping you would say Andrew Jackson

991
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:37,375
Yeah that would be the one that makes the most sense if they're identical

992
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:39,679
Browsers begging him not to

993
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:41,727
To say Woodrow Wilson

994
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:47,871
The one that made black people hide in the White House that one is that what no no can't do that one

995
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:48,639
The classic

996
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,663
6 go with the classic

997
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:52,223
Take a little moment

998
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:53,503
Here

999
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:54,271
To say thank you

1000
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,551
To a special person

1001
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:22,431
Donation letter

1002
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:32,159
Loyal and do wonderful n

1003
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:35,999
The one you really want me to do this

1004
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:56,735
Good morning

1005
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,927
Well people are cookies

1006
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,463
Cookies

1007
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10,303
Yeah it's okay yeah Rodger

1008
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:13,887
I'm disappointed in all of

1009
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:16,191
On a regular basis

1010
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:19,519
Just because it appears that the only thing we really want

1011
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:21,055
Really want

1012
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,335
And we'll reward

1013
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:23,615
Politician

1014
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:25,919
Is the ability to say nothing for a

1015
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:26,687
A long time

1016
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:29,503
Sure like we love it when you can say

1017
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:33,087
0 hours hours

1018
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:39,487
Absolutely nothing you said you better cut out a fair amount of him saying we should bomb oil fields

1019
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:46,911
That's that what we talked about

1020
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:55,615
6 a.m. Bank in Rodger Rodger

1021
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:57,663
Raisins

1022
00:58:57,919 --> 00:59:00,735
He was more a

1023
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:07,135
A visor for dictators

1024
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:09,439
So there was where the interview end

1025
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,207
And

1026
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:13,791
There's some threesome Dynamics here

1027
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:14,815
The first is that

1028
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:19,679
This clip will include the only thing that people remember this interview which is

1029
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:22,239
Trump saying your reputation

1030
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,519
I will be talking about you

1031
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,287
In the future which

1032
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:25,823
Never happen again

1033
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,103
At least publicly

1034
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,127
But

1035
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:29,151
There's also

1036
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:30,687
At before we get to that

1037
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:34,271
Trump says essentially something along the lines of like

1038
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:35,807
If I don't win I don't care

1039
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:37,343
This will make

1040
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,879
America great thing is

1041
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:41,439
Who is wonderful and write that rhetoric

1042
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:47,839
I'm going to watch TV I'll give a s*** I call you I'm not going to make America great

1043
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:49,119
Like somebody who is got

1044
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:49,887
Civic

1045
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:51,935
You know what I don't know what I would say

1046
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:28,031
Number one

1047
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:39,295
Because we

1048
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:42,879
Watching television

1049
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:47,231
It's doing that

1050
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:51,839
Doing great

1051
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:19,231
I remember that interview

1052
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:32,543
Yeah it's so there is its

1053
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:34,847
Tony this is a little strange

1054
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:35,871
Yeah

1055
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:38,175
Definitely

1056
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:41,503
A willingness to engage with any kind of

1057
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:45,087
Attempts to make America better unless it involves me winning this president

1058
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:47,135
Which I think is

1059
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,927
Shallow I mean

1060
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,791
Feel like any moral system

1061
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:56,351
Let's say I don't know a big one

1062
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:57,631
What's Christianity

1063
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:59,167
If a billionaire

1064
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,703
Where to say

1065
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:04,287
If I'm not the ruler of this country

1066
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:10,687
There's nothing I can do feel like maybe you don't believe in them

1067
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:11,455
Religion at all

1068
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:14,783
And also I would like to juxtapose this

1069
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:15,551
With someone like Bernie

1070
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:19,903
Bernie Sanders

1071
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:21,951
Then being like

1072
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:22,975
If I don't win

1073
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:30,143
Nothing to give up I refuse to believe our time I'm at the point now where my denial is that

1074
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:36,799
Bernie Sanders ever existed I refuse to believe it or not that there was so obviously someone who is right about everything that we

1075
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:37,823
We should all over

1076
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:40,127
Well the powerful Shield all over

1077
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:43,455
Be the person I just want to make his

1078
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:47,039
There is still a desire to work

1079
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:48,575
To make things better as bestie

1080
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:49,599
Pecan in whatever

1081
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:50,623
Capacity

1082
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:53,951
Regardless of winning any Epsom electroblob's watch

1083
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:57,535
DVR give a s*** like it should have been

1084
01:02:58,815 --> 01:02:59,583
Should be a problem

1085
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:00,863
.

1086
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,399
Here's here's what the okay

1087
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,679
2016

1088
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:04,959
Bernie loses

1089
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:10,847
He's pushed into the left we all we wanted it you know but what you going to do

1090
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:11,871
Right and then

1091
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:12,895
Trump wins

1092
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:15,199
And then we see all the stuff that happen

1093
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:18,015
Right and then Bernese like we'll finally

1094
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:20,831
These these idiots are ready right

1095
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:22,879
And then we still do the powerful people

1096
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:23,903
Fulfill f*** them over

1097
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:27,487
That was the one point where any reasonable person could be

1098
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:28,767
Justified being like

1099
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:32,351
All of you I'm right about everything

1100
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:34,399
They're all taking me down you're dumb

1101
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:36,191
I'm going home

1102
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:36,959
Reasonable

1103
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:41,567
Yeah it's tough to resist the impulse to

1104
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:45,407
Give it to that nihilism

1105
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:51,551
And you can see the Trump has no willingness to or interest in even trying

1106
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:53,087
If you can't be the king

1107
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,647
Now the only thing is you can see

1108
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:58,975
Has Alex's going out one of the primary

1109
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:01,279
Concerns that he has is this like

1110
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:05,631
You're not going to quit you're not a Clinton chill okay right you know like really

1111
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:07,167
That seems to be the

1112
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:11,007
Primary mission of his interview is just to convince the audience

1113
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:12,543
But he's not going to

1114
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:18,943
Quit six months down the road I whatever

1115
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:19,711
To Hillary right

1116
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:23,551
Is the conspiracy

1117
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:28,415
Least likeable candidate so that the second least likeable candidate will finally win

1118
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:29,695
Judas goat

1119
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:31,999
Exactly

1120
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:37,119
So we have some other things that are going to be happening on this episode and here's one of them

1121
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:39,679
Boo

1122
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,263
We reported Jihad

1123
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:58,367
North Carolina

1124
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:11,167
30 minutes

1125
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:23,455
Quarterback

1126
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:26,527
It was fun because Joe pigs

1127
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:27,807
The currently facing seditious

1128
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:33,439
Conspiracy charges for his actions on January 6th where he was part of the probably leadership

1129
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:35,743
To stop the certification of the 2020

1130
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:38,815
Also this is the little bit before he got into his peace

1131
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:39,583
The gate bulshit

1132
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:41,119
Also noting

1133
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:47,519
Is worth noting is that big

1134
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:49,311
The information relayed by Josh Owens

1135
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:51,103
Any piece on the New York Times

1136
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:54,175
He worked for Infowars and was along for this

1137
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:55,199
Very trip

1138
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:56,223
It's going to be discussed

1139
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:58,271
Here's how he described it to the time

1140
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:03,135
Quote in December 2015 the day before Jones interview Donald Trump

1141
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:07,999
Still a candidate at the time on his radio show I made my way to Upstate New York on assignment

1142
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,535
Along with the reporter and sex

1143
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:10,303
Can cameraman

1144
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:16,959
We were sent to visit muslim-majority communities throughout the United States to investigate would Jones instructed us to call Via

1145
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:18,239
American caliphate

1146
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:21,055
After the California geiger counter.

1147
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:24,383
Debacle that was when they were sent out to get evidence

1148
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,663
But there was radiation

1149
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:27,711
And what have you two didn't work out

1150
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:31,551
Are we had meetings with John's before trips in order to ascertain

1151
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,831
Exactly what do you want

1152
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:33,855
If we quote

1153
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,135
Awesome home runs

1154
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,415
He said we would get

1155
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,183
Significant bone

1156
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:43,071
They tried to make contact with hooks in a community called islamberg but were turned away because of

1157
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:43,839
Concerns for

1158
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:44,607
Security

1159
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:45,887
From Josh's article

1160
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:48,959
Because of the conspiracy theories about the place

1161
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:51,519
Islamberg was a constant Target of right-wing

1162
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:52,287
Extremists

1163
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:58,687
April the Tennessee man was arrested and later convicted of plotting to raise a militia to burn Islam Birds mosque

1164
01:06:58,943 --> 01:06:59,455
To the ground

1165
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:06,111
Homie days before we arrived the FBI issued an alert to law enforcement to be on the lookout for a man named John Ritter

1166
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:09,695
Timer leader of an anti-muslim movement in Arizona who post

1167
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:10,463
The video threat

1168
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,999
Violence against Muslims

1169
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:13,279
Less than two weeks earlier

1170
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:18,911
So the phone call we received later that night from a law-enforcement agent shouldn't have come as a surprise

1171
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:24,799
The officer who contacted us said he simply wanted to verify who we were after receiving the concern call for

1172
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:26,335
From somebody in Islam

1173
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:29,919
We told Jones about it and he chose to believe the call was available

1174
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:32,479
Threats and attempt to intimidate us into silence

1175
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:35,039
To him this verify that we were onto something

1176
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:38,111
Even went so far as to include Michael Bloomberg

1177
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:40,671
The former mayor of New York City in the purported

1178
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,439
Conspiracy

1179
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:46,047
Claiming he wanted to abolish the Second Amendment and they've somehow intimidating us would have achieved

1180
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:50,143
Jones told us to file a story that accused the police of harassment

1181
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:54,239
Lending Credence to the theory that this community contain dangerous potential Terror

1182
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:57,823
I knew this wasn't the case according to the information we had

1183
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:58,847
We all do

1184
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:02,175
Days before we spoke to the Sheraton the mayor of

1185
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:03,199
Deposit New York

1186
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:04,479
Nearby municipalities

1187
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:09,343
They both told us the people at islamberg were kind generous neighbors who welcomed the surrounding

1188
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,367
Community into their home

1189
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:11,903
Even celebrating holidays

1190
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:12,671
Is together

1191
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:14,975
The information did not meet our

1192
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:15,743
Expectations

1193
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:16,767
So we made it up

1194
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:19,583
Praying on the vulnerable in feeding the prejudices

1195
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,351
Hidden figures

1196
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,119
Jones's audio

1197
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:23,935
We ignored certain facts fabricated others

1198
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:25,471
Took situations out of context

1199
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:26,495
Do Veterinary

1200
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:29,311
So that's going on right now

1201
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:32,127
Joe Biggs is filing the first report

1202
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:33,919
From this

1203
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,199
Clear

1204
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:36,223
Fraudulent

1205
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:38,015
Coverage that was meant

1206
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:38,783
Antenna

1207
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:41,087
Angelita Stoke agitate

1208
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:41,855
Against

1209
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:43,903
Muslim communities

1210
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,999
You can hear even in Alex's coverage

1211
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:49,535
Of this video that

1212
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,815
Pigs is going

1213
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:51,839
To be airing

1214
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:53,119
That

1215
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:55,423
Is American caliphate

1216
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,191
Framing

1217
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:59,007
Yeah it came from Alex himself and was like

1218
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:00,799
This is what you're going out

1219
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:02,847
Application for

1220
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:04,895
That's pretty sad

1221
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:08,479
Pretty sad

1222
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:11,807
Yeah that's what it Dawn Salazar calls Reese

1223
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:13,599
Coincidence

1224
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:17,183
Picture

1225
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:19,999
So this is just a weird thing that happens

1226
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:21,791
Alex gets

1227
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:22,815
Neponset talk

1228
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:23,839
Talking about his

1229
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:25,887
Childhood violence and possibly murder

1230
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:26,655
What

1231
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:06,847
17 year old

1232
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:32,447
I want to get off me

1233
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:58,303
What the f***

1234
01:10:58,559 --> 01:10:59,327
This is sunset

1235
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:01,375
What the fuk just happened there

1236
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:06,751
Did we just turned into a weird trauma situation what is going on

1237
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:09,567
Very bizarre

1238
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:14,175
I guess that's a rationalization for

1239
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:16,223
Into the concrete cuz it

1240
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:17,503
Besides any wine

1241
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:18,783
So let me try and

1242
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:22,367
Let me see if I understand this already embarked let me see if I understand this

1243
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,135
Story correctly

1244
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:23,903
Alex

1245
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:25,695
Has this person's head

1246
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:28,767
Slamming into the ground and they're asking a question

1247
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:30,303
Apparently apparently

1248
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:36,447
Hey what are you doing and then Alex

1249
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:37,983
Standing over them

1250
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:40,031
Holding their head in his hands as

1251
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:41,311
I want you to get off

1252
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:42,335
Yeah

1253
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:49,247
I don't want to I don't want you to come back I want to kill you so you can't believe me again

1254
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:52,063
I understand but that was a that was a metaphor in a

1255
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:53,087
Fictional book

1256
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:54,111
Apparently it's

1257
01:11:54,367 --> 01:12:00,511
Literal and not a Ben Carson Story for Alloy also made up story still yeah

1258
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:02,559
Emotional adult seems Wild

1259
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:08,447
Okay man unsettling

1260
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:10,751
Not good don't make me feel good

1261
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:17,407
Know about Alex genre that the story belongs to

1262
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:19,967
And that is the standing up to bullies story

1263
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:22,271
This is a bad version of a standing up to bullies

1264
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:24,575
Story

1265
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:27,903
Generally is like they're threatening violence against you then maybe you punch

1266
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:33,023
The belief and they're like okay okay okay whatever I'm not going to pick on you anymore

1267
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:34,303
As a whole

1268
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:36,095
All of the vile

1269
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:42,495
Right or even like a great version of the story would be a bully picking on you and you say I'm not going to take this

1270
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:45,823
Is anymore and you stand up to them and then it's just words

1271
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:48,127
Birds that are able to diffuse the situation

1272
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:52,735
A bad version of it is I'm slamming their head into the concrete in

1273
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:54,271
Trying to make it so they

1274
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,807
Can't hurt me anymore

1275
01:12:56,063 --> 01:13:00,415
Is f***** up right so what happened was this guy was like huh

1276
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:01,951
Your shoes are stupid

1277
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:03,487
And I hate bullies

1278
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:06,559
So I beat his head into the ground repeatedly

1279
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:08,607
Yeah

1280
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:13,215
This illustrates a real lack of understanding of like

1281
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:15,007
Who will believe

1282
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:18,335
Is that appropriate self-defense

1283
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:24,223
Losing your s*** I mean let's just say emotional control in any way whatsoever

1284
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,295
No

1285
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:31,135
We have

1286
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:33,695
These things that are going on in a

1287
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:34,975
We have Alex

1288
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:37,279
Mine talking about

1289
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:38,559
Murder

1290
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:43,935
We have the Trump interview right we have Joe Biggs agitating against Muslim

1291
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:44,959
Brighton MN

1292
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:47,775
That was Joe Barry coming on the floor bouquet

1293
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,903
Where you going next

1294

Stranglehold

1296
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:49,215
Number one

1297
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:51,007
Larry right now this

1298
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:53,311
Common sense

1299
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:54,335
Are you

1300
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:57,919
Everybody on here program

1301
01:14:58,687 --> 01:14:59,455
Looking for that

1302

You know here it is December

And whole world

1305
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:05,343
Alright

1306
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:06,367
Okay

1307
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:07,391
Okay

1308
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:09,439
Ted Ted

1309
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:13,023
You are so rich and you live in the middle of

1310
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:14,047
Nowhere

1311
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:17,887
And you just go hunting and why are you bitching

1312
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:18,655
Wow

1313
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:19,423
Because

1314
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:23,263
I do like that like I really do everything is like

1315
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,567
I can feel the tide

1316
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,615
You can feel this

1317
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:30,175
Sucks

1318
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:33,503
I like that

1319
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:34,527
I don't like hearing test

1320
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:38,111
It is weird that the

1321
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,135
President of the United

1322
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:40,415
It states

1323
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:44,255
The future president of the United States was on this show the same time

1324
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:45,279
Alex

1325
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:46,303
Had

1326
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,839
People making up

1327
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:49,119
Fake stories

1328
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:51,679
About Jihadi training camp

1329
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:53,215
You know like

1330
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:55,519
Just average citizens

1331
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,055
Like that

1332
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:58,591
That is insane

1333
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:01,407
Eddie's I don't know how to process that

1334
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:02,687
Yeah yeah

1335
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:03,967
What do we do

1336
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,783
This is real

1337
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:10,367
This is real it has a lot of the similar shades

1338
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:12,415
Do the Rogan was on 9/11

1339
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:17,023
No like it is Lee like oh that's

1340
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:23,423
He had Ted Nugent on it suggested he should be VP and was airing the begin

1341
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:27,519
Beginning of his segments where he sent his employees out to lie about Muslim Community

1342
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,287
Totally

1343
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:29,311
Yep

1344
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:30,335
Yeah

1345
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:31,871
That I mean it's just

1346
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:33,407
Wengie

1347
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:34,943
We've talked about the past

1348
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:36,479
Talked about

1349
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:37,503
Octopuses

1350
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:38,271
Fake right

1351
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:39,039
We're asleep

1352
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:40,831
There's something going on

1353
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:43,135
We're going to wake up in a better

1354
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:44,415
Situation where it's like

1355
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:46,207
Don't know of course this wouldn't

1356
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:47,487
Happened it's not possible

1357
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:49,023
It's absurd

1358
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,303
I mean

1359
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:54,655
You're shaking

1360
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:59,263
So you know we have this episode where Trump is on

1361
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:03,103
Alex spent the time before Trump came on

1362
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:05,151
Covering the news which is

1363
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:09,759
Is proton pack

1364
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:14,623
Not all the way in do you likes another tab

1365
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:30,495
Well you know I hear

1366
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:31,519
Coming from Ted

1367
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:32,287
Cruising

1368
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:34,079
From Donald Trump

1369
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:38,175
Marco Rubio

1370
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:46,367
Ever had

1371
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,903
Wow

1372
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:48,927
I'm in

1373
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:55,327
Ted Cruz guy

1374
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:57,375
U.s. constitutional

1375
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:01,471
Man they don't like Ted Cruz anymore

1376
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:05,055
When can chain

1377
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:09,407
So quick embarrassed him about January 6th

1378
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:10,687
No

1379
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:13,759
To no good persona non grata

1380
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:15,039
Frightening Lee until

1381
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,343
What does it

1382
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:18,111
Take

1383
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:19,391
To scare these people with

1384
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:20,159
Intelligence

1385
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:25,279
Not much I don't think can't be that much

1386
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:29,119
Just to be on the side of the aisle

1387
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:31,423
Right person

1388
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:33,215
Long division

1389
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:36,031
Sure

1390
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:38,847
Long division

1391
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:39,871
5

1392
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:42,431
5 numbers or more

1393
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:44,479
This club might not be all that meaningful

1394
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:46,015
But Alex has some words

1395
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:47,295
Democrats

1396
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:49,087
And I thought this was

1397
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:49,855
Bizarre

1398
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:55,487
Especially considering our last episode we looked at a 2003 episode where Alex is scolding someone for saying damn

1399
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:57,535
You know I don't even I can't even

1400
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:00,863
Nowadays

1401
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:07,007
Anybody would look like

1402
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:21,855
Whoa

1403
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:22,879
Weird

1404
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:26,207
Very out-of-left-field

1405
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:26,975
Yeah

1406
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:28,767
Yeah

1407
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:30,047
I guess it's fine now

1408
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:35,167
Yeah I mean it doesn't have the ring of wet ass p**** but I think it's still making pretty

1409
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:41,567
Get song out of it 12 years later this show is no longer required viewing for homeschoolers apparently

1410
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:45,151
It's totally fine to just

1411
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:48,735
McFly guess they found out they read back through their demographics in real life

1412
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:54,879
05 we've been doing the Muppet Babies version of this

1413
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:56,927
Why

1414
01:19:58,463 --> 01:20:00,511
Show me one last clip honestly because

1415
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:06,911
I've Ted Nugent talk more I lost my interest in what was going on even though

1416
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:09,215
David Knight is going to be Sheriff thing

1417
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:15,616
The Joe Biggs conversation and every airing of the trumpet of you I felt like maybe

1418
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:16,640
I'm going to give that a pass

1419
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:18,688
So this is where I lost

1420
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:19,712
All patient

1421
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:21,248
Whatsoever for the

1422
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:55,040
Facebook

1423
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,088
Lilian Garcia

1424
01:20:57,344 --> 01:20:58,112
Between

1425
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:00,160
4 million pesos

1426
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:00,928
Poker

1427
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:06,048
Percentile

1428
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:09,888
Indicated

1429
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:13,472
Mango Tango

1430
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:21,664
Bored

1431
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:30,112
It's everywhere it's everywhere

1432
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:35,488
Also I would say terms of like songs that are disqualifying Ted from running for office

1433
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:43,168
Low on that little number of other ones about wanted to f*** children there so I think maybe

1434
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:45,728
Are much more of a problem

1435
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:52,640
I mean it keeps Ted out of maybe consideration for public office

1436
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:53,408
The way you be

1437
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,992
Eviscerated by anybody he was running the camp

1438
01:21:57,504 --> 01:22:00,576
Mailman I don't know anymore

1439
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:04,416
Going to be a senator who f****** nose

1440
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:05,696
None of it matters

1441
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:08,000
They're all insane everything's over

1442
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,792
Climate change is here today

1443
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:12,096
Everyone going down it's all done

1444
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:17,472
I'm basing this on a 2015 mentality exactly

1445
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:21,312
Yeah Department of the interior

1446
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:26,688
Just I hate get off Hunters back I really don't think that they have any

1447
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:27,968
Clue what the department

1448
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:28,992
The interior does

1449
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:30,272
Other than be like

1450
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:32,320
I think that's what the name is on the license

1451
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:33,856
The inside

1452
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,976
It's not the grounds Department of the interior of your heart

1453
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:41,024
Right right right

1454
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:43,328
This

1455
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:46,656
I mean look I think that there is a world

1456
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:48,960
Who are to be made with that this

1457
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:50,752
Interview really isn't that

1458
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:52,032
Consequential is a lot of

1459
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:53,568
People build it up to

1460
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:54,848
Right right

1461
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:57,920
Happened

1462
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:59,200
Is of note

1463
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:02,272
The stuff that goes on in it isn't

1464
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:06,880
Like it's not necessarily things Trump didn't say other places

1465
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:09,952
Rai said bomb the oil fields in other contexts

1466
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:10,720
Yep

1467
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:13,792
Talk s*** about all kinds of stuff and other contacts

1468
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:14,560
Not like

1469
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:16,864
Revelatory on that level

1470
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,680
But from our perspective looking at Alex Jones

1471
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:20,704
Certainly

1472
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,008
It's very clear what his agenda

1473
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:27,104
In the interview it's very clear that he's trying to

1474
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:31,200
Make sure the Trump is actually doing this and actually going to work

1475
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:34,016
Because it would be kind of dope is for him to

1476
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:36,064
Like throw his weight

1477
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,344
Behind this person then

1478
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:38,368
Them

1479
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:40,672
Back out and Hillary ends up winning

1480
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,512
You know there it happened I guess that's kind of

1481
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,584
Like what he had to do with Ron Paul over and over again

1482
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,400
I didn't really I wasn't really too like

1483
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:52,448
Aware

1484
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:55,008
During the whole Ross Perot run

1485
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:56,800
Obviously cuz I was very young

1486
01:23:58,336 --> 01:23:59,360
But like look

1487
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:00,384
Looking back the eye

1488
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,944
Dia of being a Ross Perot support

1489
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:05,504
And then he drops out of the race

1490
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:08,832
And you're like s*** I was a Ross Perot supporter

1491
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:15,232
And then he just suddenly reappears and he's like I'm back in it that's the most qualified

1492
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:18,816
I can pick up right just suddenly somebody popping about that again

1493
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:23,936
Prospero in some ways in as much as like

1494
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:25,472
I think anybody who tries

1495
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:28,032
Think about Ross Perot can just think about the

1496
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:29,824
Can't do anything about it

1497
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:30,848
Can't do it

1498
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:32,384
Somebody who's

1499
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:38,784
Entire Legacy or memory and most of the public eye is an impression of him

1500
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:40,832
There's there's a dead area

1501
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:44,928
Is the the church lady and then there's

1502
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:50,048
And those are the two things that Dana Carvey is ruined forever how dare you what about turtles

1503
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:56,448
Turtles and live longer than Dana Carvey and they'll be gone long after Dana Carvey

1504
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:04,384
So we come to the end of this and we have now covered Trump

1505
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:07,968
Appearance

1506
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:15,136
And yeah we'll see how long this vacation goes but we have probably

1507
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:16,160
Some

1508
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:18,208
Stuff for next week

1509
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:19,488
In the hopper

1510
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:20,768
So like

1511
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:24,352
One way or another we'll be fine but if he doesn't come back soon

1512
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:29,728
Holyshit are we going to do Harrison Smith podcast absolutely not

1513
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:31,008
Going to stay in the past

1514
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:32,288
Never coming back to this

1515
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:34,848
This present what if we try and find out what Harris

1516
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:39,456
Smith was up to in 2003 Middle School

1517
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:40,736
Elementary

1518
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:45,088
Probably find out what David night was up to in 1982

1519
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,368
Okay

1520
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:47,392
Seems like a morrin

1521
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:48,416
Interesting question for me

1522
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:52,256
What's David Knight some young Hotshot somewhere that's kind of what I wanted

1523
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:58,656
Did David like bring the heat when he was a younger man you want a contest to work it into a war

1524
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:05,056
So I don't think so I think he was just a curmudgeonly young

1525
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:06,848
Libertarian that's my guess

1526
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:09,920
Let's go to be disappointed

1527
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:14,272
Now we'll never know now that's true but until then

1528
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:18,112
Website.com also

Have a sublet

1531
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:28,352
In my mind

1532
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:29,888
Going to

1533
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:32,448
You have your own bathroom

1534
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,240
That I'm like you don't have your own bathroom

1535
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:36,544
Hoosier bathroom bedroom

1536
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:41,664
Out there's no door though it's just those beaded doorway

1537
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:44,480
Anyway

1538
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:49,344
Holding

1539
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:54,464
