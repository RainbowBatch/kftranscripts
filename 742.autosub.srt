1
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:21,248
Air Jordan

2
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for its knowledge B

3
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:34,048
We are the bad guys

4
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,904
Stripe.com

5
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,304
Sit around feed from the bottom

6
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,704
For the elders Lane and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

7
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,104
My break is I was doing laundry in apartment

8
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,504
On the way to the laundry room and I got that smell of weed

9
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,904
Yum yum yum I don't smoke weed anymore

10
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,208
I have in my day

11
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:38,048
There is still a fondness that I have for the smell of

12
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:44,448
Weed when I hear it when I feel when I hear or field or smile

13
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:50,848
The smell made me think of those

14
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:55,712
Days back when I was living in apartments and like you just come up with these like

15
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,480
Alright

16
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:02,880
Here's how I'm going to get away with smoking weed Secret

17
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:09,280
Yep you have those like toilet paper tubes with fabric softener sheets Camp yet

18
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,384
Yeah yeah that's good you know that's weird I have 20 fond memories of all the times that I've smoked

19
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,784
Indoor cigarettes indoors you know like the stink of that gets inside the walls yeah I kind of

20
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,184
And the stink with weed smoke I do remember but it still gets inside the walls but it's like a weird fun house

21
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,584
House version of inside the wall the flip side of that though is if you spilled bong water on a rug

22
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,424
Ubisoft with fire

23
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:54,080
Wistful for those are those old days

24
00:02:54,336 --> 00:03:00,480
Deanne is at the World Series their plan if they are I understand the Philly

25
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:06,880
Airplane versus the Astros

26
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:13,280
Cheaters Liars appear in the world series playoffs

27
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:19,680
Boo sure

28
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,728
6 years ago maybe three

29
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:28,128
More

30
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:34,528
But exciting still my favorite players on the Phillies

31
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:40,928
Kyle schwarber Cubs hero for the 2016

32
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,696
World Series

33
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:45,280
Sherburne County all the time

34
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,608
Show me what time is like a God can't be your hero

35
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:55,008
You know like your hero is

36
00:03:55,264 --> 00:04:01,408
Zeus has the greater tality is required for idolizing

37
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:05,248
Baseball player it's the kind of guy that only exists in baseball you know

38
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:10,112
Somebody baseball player was very big mostly uncoordinated

39
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,648
But hits balls far

40
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,976
It is that kind of guy can't run very fast

41
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:21,631
Can people who are like the DH absolutely put God damn it if he's a big dude who hits balls far right

42
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:28,031
Thinking of Big Papi Ortiz

43
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:33,919
He's a big dude but he's also good hitter

44
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,455
Six-foot-five

45
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:41,855
He swings are beautiful bat and he's going to miss it 99% of the quantitative hit

46
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:54,655
Connects your in the stratosphere but otherwise

47
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,959
Sort of athlete because it is like

48
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:02,847
The tension is is like could be over in a second

49
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:09,247
I thought it said baseball has those got you don't like another subset of that guy's the big fat guy who can throw hard

50
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:15,647
Eunos left-handed pitcher he's huge can't run for s*** but goddamnit he throws 95

51
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:22,303
Put them on the magic arm I have an affinity for the Phillies for no reason

52
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:28,703
My old roommate owes a big guys from Philly

53
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,519
Good Times watching

54
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:37,919
Sixers games with him and she hit Billy Phillies games

55
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:43,039
Have fun as long as they're winning

56
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:49,439
When they lose then angry

57
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:57,375
So Jordan today we have to go over as we know Alex has been on a permanent

58
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:01,983
Roman Holiday Vacation

59
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,519
Come into the week

60
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,335
We still don't let know what to do

61
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:12,991
Thankfully we have depositions

62
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:20,415
I had to kind of thought maybe we would wait a little bit longer to do this but hey the occasion

63
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,463
Year the space needs to be filled

64
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,999
And people enjoy it

65
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,351
Inexplicably so in the Connecticut case

66
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,911
Alex had 24 days of depositions

67
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,727
So we have that stew cover

68
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:39,359
That is impossible to do in the context of one episode

69
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,639
Day one

70
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,943
Alex's deposition

71
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,343
Navigate to get some clarity for this this is the deposition

72
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:55,743
He did after faking illness do not go to Connecticut to sit for the the deposition

73
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:02,143
Diagnosis the Minotaur and the other sinus blockage

74
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:06,751
Add a little stuffy nose

75
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:10,847
I think if I were devising a hell for Alex it would be

76
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:15,967
Like waking up on Monday and being told you're going to do 4 days of depositions

77
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:22,367
And then waking up the next Monday and being told you're going to do for it forever and ever and ever you know like never-ending

78
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:35,167
In the second position they talked about how they had to reschedule cuz I wanted to go to Hawaii with his wife

79
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:38,495
Wearing a shirt or a luxury resort

80
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:44,895
I can't I can't let go from making a murderer interrogation to this s*** you know like that's not okay

81
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:51,295
Okay another thing I should point out is there there's a couple of things will become abundantly clear as we go through this

82
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:57,695
And one is that Alex hasn't learned anything from any of these deposition experiences he's at

83
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:04,095
Sing an answering questions in ways that are like baby that made sense in the first episode

84
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:10,495
This question and the answer so you can't really say I don't know

85
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,287
The time is packed a little silly

86
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,103
And then the other thing is that Alex Hates Chris Mattie

87
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,639
It's very clear

88
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:21,247
I don't think it would be fair to say that he liked mark

89
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,527
But

90
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,135
Give very seriously suits.

91
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,927
I'm not sure why

92
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:34,047
They clearly say that they have not met before

93
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:40,959
Bucking maddaddam I can see that I can see that has something that Alex

94
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:47,359
Grudgingly is like in another works you know that Perry Mason moment thing and I like in another world I could see

95
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,919
Me and you Big Fred's that guy to fix

96
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:56,319
Madame sort of like a Owens game recognize game

97
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,135
I think I think

98
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,951
It's more than that

99
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,231
If I had to guess

100
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:09,631
I would guess the day-to-day Chris Maddie is much more of what appears to be a normal lawyer then thinmar

101
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,727
A vibe to him

102
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,007
Whereas

103
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,079
Maddie is it is a lawyer

104
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:24,479
And maybe Alex really hates back

105
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,551
Okay so Maddie and Mark both lawyers now

106
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
Alright

107
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:34,975
We go into a Mad Max scenario Mark might still be a lawyer in that scenario I think Maddie is not going to be

108
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,999
A lawyer

109
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:42,399
He's he's in the front of the truck you know and I accidentally touched on another Dynamic here and that is the norm is there

110
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,823
Couple points where Norm seems to just want to have fun and

111
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,127
Scrapes inappropriate Goodway

112
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:58,527
Anyway we'll get down to business on this and just a moment the first Jordan let's take a little moment to say hello to some doo-wop

113
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:02,111
First I made a dreamy creamy and my pants thank you so much

114
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:08,511
Trained my dog's peanut pumpkin and pickle

115
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:12,607
How to growl and bark whenever Alex starts yelling

116
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:19,007
Thank you very much I was actually why we started the podcast I do help for future break in

Pro wrestler orange Cassidy

121
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:50,239
Was wondering whether that was going to Jordan so first

122
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:53,311
Partner patches CPA thank you so much you're not a technocrat

123
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:59,711
Bald patches, alright

124
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:04,575
Next mrs. Jones is a tennis partner

125
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,647

129
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:31,711
Thank you so much thank you very much

130
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:38,111
In the beginning of this deposition is of course some of the formalities and such and their bits

131
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:44,511
Cut out and that's like his his address and I think these kinds of things

132
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,279
Oldest house

133
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:50,655
Right and what have you deal with any of that

134
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,423
Just because

135
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,727
There isn't anything really to discuss

136
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,495
Rihanna house

137
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:02,431
The first clip we're going to have here is I thought I found this to be a little bit of a non sequitur but it also sets a bit of

138
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,199
Overtone

139
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,991
And that is that like

140
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:11,647
Almost every question is probably going to be a trap out

141
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,439
Did you have a photographic memory

142
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:16,255
Utility memory not more

143
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:21,375
Have you ever told anybody that you have a photographic memory

144
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,167
Have a very reggae memory

145
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:28,031
Try to commit something to it I can remember really well but it's Desmond like that but

146
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,871
Let my question was whether you never told anybody that

147
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,783
Hyperbole just drive myself as having percent

148
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,855
You did that when you appeared on The Joe Rogan

149
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:42,879
Podcast

150
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,439
Oh damn it is millions of audience members

151
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,975
Photographic memory correct

152
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,279
Particularly

153
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,327
You don't have a photographic memory that

154
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,399
Alright okay

155
00:12:54,655 --> 00:13:00,543
That's why I that's alright I'm already kind of I get where he's coming from Hayden Chris Betty alright

156
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:06,943
I wish it talk or two if it if I'd lawyer came to me with every time I talk s*** I be like alright

157
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:13,343
First of all there's a dunk of you don't have a photographic memory of that

158
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:19,743
Not feel great

159
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:26,143
What you have is a attempt to be like you have a really good memory you said this thing

160
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,215
Because it helps dislike from the

161
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:35,871
Copious amount of times Alex is going to say oh I don't remember that

162
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:42,271
Well we're going to hear that a lot

163
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:48,415
All alright

164
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:54,815
The zone of depositions are we this isn't his first step has issuing no his last deposition

165
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,887
Position in Connecticut

166
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:04,287
Because you saying that he and Maddie haven't met before it gets the first intern

167
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:10,687
Terms of that but do you think it's definitely after the Texas one

168
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:17,087
I was at Texas has been deposed at least a couple times a week

169
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:23,487
Fairly good at this by now she was someone who like to learn learning

170
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,863
Turns out that Alex did not come alone

171
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,679
Connecticut people in tow

172
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,215
But he doesn't know who they are

173
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,775
Understand that you arrived at our building today with

174
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,823
Somebody was operating a digital camera device

175
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,455
Me a phone

176
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:45,759
Well

177
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,575
Where did you arrive at our building with somebody who's calling you

178
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:52,415
Over-the-phone yes is that

179
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,487
It's just one of those

180
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,511
Coronavirus

181
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:04,703
I forget his name is Juan called

182
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,007
He traveled with you from Texas

183
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,031
Yes

184
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,823
For the purpose of filming you

185
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,871
Just documenting

186
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,663
Casey 19th Avenue

187
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,735
Okay and you intend to

188
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,783
Publish the footage that he shoots

189
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,063
I'm one of your broadcast after

190
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
Deposition

191
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:21,855
I don't know

192
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,159
Probably not

193
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,695
Prepared to do that

194
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
Yes

195
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,327
Because you've been raising money

196
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,863
From your audience

197
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,959
And you advise them that you need their funds to help

198
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,239
Financial litigation

199
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:47,199
So if it's not a compliment that this person that I've flown up to Connecticut with

200
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:53,855
I don't know their name

201
00:15:54,111 --> 00:16:00,255
We different parts of the plane right isn't it yeah I don't think this is true I'm going to guess that

202
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,071
Being just invasive for the sake of it

203
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:12,543
I'd like a damning secret who this person is

204
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,359
Has David Duke or something

205
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:21,759
But it it's it's it's a weird thing to be evasive about yeah who is this person who

206
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,039
You have is your camera person

207
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,111
Ethan Hunt

208
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,415
Nav wearing a mask

209
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:32,511
He's on a super secret mission okay he's got to stop

210
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:39,167
Something else got completely unrelated but because Alex has his contacts through the knowing they hating the global

211
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:44,031
Right he's posing as Alex it's completely unrelated think it's a coincidence

212
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:51,199
I think that maybe it's a sign that anybody who has a seniority it in

213
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:56,575
Infowars can't take any time off cuz I need them back at the the mothership is Alex says

214
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:02,975
Or I don't know it's just weird or it just doesn't remember Buckley's name anymore

215
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,255
Like I said more I don't think

216
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:09,631
This I believe is a very important early exchange kind of goes on

217
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,911
You do text

218
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,191
People don't you

219
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,471
You know that we have

220
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,495
Send TextMe

221
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:20,383
Yeah man we turned all over you guys and you said we didn't need to fall to this

222
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:23,199
You don't want to be able to put on a rosary

223
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,735
It shows when do you think was

224
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,503
The first X-Men

225
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,647
Increase you

226
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,439
Is side of the aisle in

227
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,279
So did you mean by we mister

228
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,143
I know

229
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,471
Go back that you said we

230
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
Gave you everything

231
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,263
And who's we

232
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,055
I instructed

233
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,847
Lle Chasers

234
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,663
Could you turn over whatever it is people said turnover

235
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,455
You know it's been a fiasco

236
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,783
Hundreds of thousands of emails documents all sorts of crap people

237
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,391
Searching my phone all the time

238
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,951
Contentions armor was like stuff from years ago

239
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,743
Protect message don't update

240
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:11,071
People wanting stuff doesn't exist but I'm not a big fat guy

241
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,863
And I'm so I don't

242
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:19,263
I do understand how that stuff works and I don't know why something nice text messages stay

243
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:24,127
Different different Services there different used to

244
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,431
They were disappearing couple weeks now they go back

245
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:29,247
You're usually Lyle as though you're asking me

246
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:36,415
Technology issues the same things happening

247
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,975
I know I don't understand

248
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,279
Anybody that has cell phones nose

249
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:45,887
That they're different ones of different things for different things going on and I don't understand it all

250
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:49,727
But but the emails we should have just heard

251
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,519
Pocket money than getting rid of them

252
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:55,871
We got him going back fifteen years million times a million times you guys are able to get those

253
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,431
So if anything we have

254
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,063
Unless you know

255
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,135
Sync my text messages sometimes do get saved

256
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,047
You have any knowledge of whether any

257
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:14,815
Read text messages

258
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,839
Yours has ever been

259
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,375
By you or fries

260
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:18,911
To us

261
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,191
Give me knowledge

262
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,239
I believe they have you believe that they

263
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,055
Do you have any knowledge

264
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:30,175
I'm out of money. Not somebody talking to front of me

265
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:30,943
Right

266
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,223
I didn't ask you again.

267
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:41,695
So I think this is really critical because a key here is kind of putting aside Alex's bulshit

268
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:46,559
He complied fully with discovery that he was defaulted on Fairlane

269
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:53,215
I just keeping on target Maddie is able to get Alex to concede that he has absolutely no idea what text messages

270
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,519
We're actually turned over to the plaintiffs' lawyers

271
00:19:56,031 --> 00:20:02,175
Alex's pronouncements about how much you cooperated are matters of certainty when he's rambling on his show

272
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:05,247
I'm standing at a disgraceful press conference outside the courtroom

273
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:11,135
When he's actually forced to answer yes or no if he has any idea what he actually did for discovery

274
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,159
Is no anything

275
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:18,047
This is our answer because it's less of a problem than him saying that he intentionally withheld things

276
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:21,631
Which seems like a far more likely situation to me at this point

277
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:28,287
It's it's good because you know you have that Dodge we turned over everything chat what do

278
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:32,895
Do you know about what you turned up while I believe I said that like you don't know anything

279
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,455
You're just making broad pronouncements about s***

280
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:39,039
If you if you did not intentionally withhold things

281
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:44,159
Then your explanation for why they don't have text messages is not

282
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,463
The power of magic

283
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:52,863
Can compel phones to do any number of different things as possible party would be able to say

284
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:59,263
Looked over my stuff and on XYZ date for my lawyers of this

285
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,311
I turned it over to them on this date

286
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:07,711
Because then you could start the ball rolling and be like the breakdown happen did your lawyers not turn over

287
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:14,111
Overstuffed to us that you turned over to them questions in the eye

288
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:20,512
Stuff happened simply one of the easiest ways to

289
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:26,912
I believe anything somebody says about their text messages if there's a text message saying I texted you all of my

290
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:33,312
Text messages of some sort or I have given you all of this information that would be sent by at some people's phones

291
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:39,712
Chucky pets. Mobile has a policy of erasing those.

292
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,760
That's a good policy I like that

293
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:45,856
Sooner we get to what is maybe the the classic

294
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:50,720
Beginning of a deposition question which is what did you do to prepare for this

295
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,768
Would you do to prepare for your deposition today

296
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,520
Really not much

297
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:09,408
Kobe

298
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,968
You know what I eat sleep and drink sir

299
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,272
You'd argumentative

300
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:21,952
You don't care about Madeleine Albright's don't have none kids you think you want to just do a nice because I'm a conservative and I know it's all political

301
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:25,536
And I literally

302
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:29,888
Remember to make intentions people questioning at covering it

303
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,728
How do I prepare I have no idea what you're going to ask me in here

304
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,800
Well you have an idea cuz you can just hose 3 times in Texas don't you

305
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:42,688
You can describe thanks it is supposed to explain I guess

306
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:49,344
Bizarre but all of this whatever I mr. Jones

307
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,112
Whatever

308
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,440
Perfection diplomas characterizes attest

309
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:06,496
Like it's pointless argumentativeness I wonder if there's an expectation or a hoe

310
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,032
Hope that he'll say this

311
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,080
And then the Lord will be like you know what

312
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:16,736
F****** right let ticket Madeleine Albright she just died not too long ago but that's how I can sue her fur

313
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:19,552
First and then take care of you

314
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,088
Overlake

315
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:27,488
Is it is it is he hoping somebody like you know what you're right Madeleine Albright is a bigger problem and therefore this little

316
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:33,888
Gation to is over what's the best case scenario for bringing up Madeleine Albright

317
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,168
In this conversation

318
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,728
Is it what is it more like he's like

319
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,264
Hey you know what

320
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,664
We're not talking about Madeleine Albright right now we're talkin about you and then you can be like haha

321
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:52,064
I think what it is is that Alex's

322
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:58,464
Mind works so much just on the basis of deflection everything just comes down to

323
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,280
Do like every question is answered with a

324
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:07,680
This thing is this other thing and do know I didn't exist I don't think he can stop himself I think it's just

325
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:13,568
Ingrained behavior and how he gets out of hard questions in his day-to-day life

326
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:17,920
Kind of questions and when you're monologuing

327
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,712
Yeah because

328
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,504
If it doesn't really work

329
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,784
In a deposition

330
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,880
No I'm not you know it does it reminds me of like

331
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:32,000
You know not to bring up the S8 not about the divorce but in the divorce trial where

332
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:37,632
The lawyer is arguing like on the show he's one thing and then off the show is another

333
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:42,240
But the more we hear him in depositions wearing hats to not be on the show

334
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:45,824
Or in court when he has to not be on the show

335
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:52,480
He's on the show man yeah I don't know if he's ever not on well there's another thing going on here

336
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:57,600
That is that by this point Alex has had these Texas deposition

337
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:04,000
The videos of them have been released on on YouTube

338
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,560
He may think like I'm kind of Performing here

339
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,608
I am

340
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:15,264
I don't know I don't know the extent to which that would change his behavior

341
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,824
Yeah we really will have to

342
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:24,224
Like straight-up Truman Show him in order to observe him in his natural habitat have to get rid of all the confounding very

343
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,368
100

344
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:37,024
So like I said this was the makeup that position before the one that Alex canceled on brand this comes up a little

345
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,840
And you feel well today

346
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,144
Your head is clear

347
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:47,776
I'm going to have sinus infection stuff but I'm almost over I heard about

348
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:50,592
Is that sinus blockage clear up

349
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,176
It was it was very real I went to the other three depositions

350
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:56,992
About sick last week

351
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,552
Talk about something else how much touchdown and then

352
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,112
Forgot was really bad sinus infection but I think

353
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,648
The day after you found out

354
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,952
It was a sinus blockage you said your audience

355
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,232
Did you feel like a new person right

356
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,048
Cuz I got on steroids

357
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,168
He wants to show you know that's what I'm talking about so you feel good today

358
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:20,800
I'm still really bad allergies and it's Antebellum on Claritin

359
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,200
I'm alright

360
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:33,856
It's very strange because he's trying to pretend that he's still recovering from this whatever

361
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:40,256
Presented with the you said you were a new person the next fully over

362
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:45,632
Allergies shifting it a little bit so yeah the very bizarre need to

363
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:52,288
Justify his pretending that he wasn't over whatever he bailed

364
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:56,896
Yeah yeah yeah I feel like I would want to remain at that point I'll be like Alex

365
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:01,504
How can I ask you a question that you'll answer like maybe you should

366
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:08,416
You write up a question that you can answer and I'm kinda see what the vibe on is going to go through hours of content here at

367
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:14,560
That question is not answered the how can I ask you a question you'll answer

368
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:17,632
I don't understand why Alex doesn't just say like

369
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,168
Can I ask you a question

370
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:19,936
You know like

371
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,704
There's

372
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:27,360
He is very little by just being all business he's already

373
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:33,760
In the soup up to his thorax and he's not going to bail himself out there's not going to be

374
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:40,160
Be like some Escape hatches going to find Pride by saying just the right evasive thing

375
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:44,768
Just serve everyone's purposes better if you just like all right let's do this

376
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,072
2222

377
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:50,656
Even if you have to be kind of a blunt dick

378
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:53,216
In order to do that it's

379
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,776
Your images is already shot

380
00:27:56,032 --> 00:28:02,176
Just be an a****** we're all kind of watching Alex in the bottom of an hour

381
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:08,576
Glasses it fills with sand and he's like struggling to get out and he thinks he's going to get out and as we all watch or like that

382
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:15,232
Sans is going to cover your neck man you're gone you're done for you might as well relax and enjoy

383
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,768
Like Toy Story 3

384
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:23,168
So the question comes up of whether or not Alex will appear in court

385
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:29,568
Agree with him on this one and that he says if I don't have to I don't want to be there

386
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,896
And then I just Rambles

387
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,688
The testimony that you give

388
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,224
In this case

389
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,992
To be presented to

390
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,016
Imagery interstate

391
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:38,784
Yes

392
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,832
The jury's going to be sitting in Waterbury

393
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:42,624
Yes

394
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:46,976
The trial in this matter is currently scheduled for

395
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,048
If you plan to appear for that

396
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,120
Needtobreathe

397
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,424
Well you're a defendant in the case

398
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,448
Right

399
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:59,264
Well I mean I believe it's rigged and so

400
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,056
You guys are going to ring your deal

401
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,080
Itssliker

402
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,104
Victor Jory

403
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,128
Egyptian

404
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:11,040
It's winter somebody guilty in the jury decide how guilty

405
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,672
Defend ourselves

406
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:19,488
Show me the sink that's America does

407
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,536
I've got all these big ideas and stuff then

408
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:29,216
I bet family with cancer and people die really bad stuff in my life so this is nothing

409
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,288
It's just a bunch of politicians and lawyers

410
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,384
Want to make money and become famous off of dead kids

411
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:42,016
When is completely opposite

412
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,064
From the first times I questioned it

413
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,832
Loosestrife

414
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,368
It's not responsible

415
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,904
Play Dua.

416
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,696
Testifying for the jury

417
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,000
Is it

418
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,816
Do I need to be there I will be there yes

419
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:55,840
You prefer.

420
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:56,608
Be there

421
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,400
Jackson

422
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,984
Prefer not to be there

423
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:08,896
Great honesty

424
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:15,296
Matter if you fully accepted responsibility for what happened or not like there's no way you would want to be there

425
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:18,368
A monster I'm a bad person now

426
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,648
Actually

427
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:26,304
Yes Alex's presentation should be yes I do want to be there

428
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,104
A very human level of course I want to be there even if you're fighting your good name you know like I know human-level I don't want

429
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,944
Want to be in a situation where I have to fight for my good name and all I got was yours

430
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:49,344
I would like to be on a beach somewhere that's it that's a reasonable response all things being equal I don't want to be there

431
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,928
The situation is what it is Alex absolute

432
00:30:53,952 --> 00:31:00,096
Stand up and prove that he can look at firing squad in the face

433
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:05,984
Choice but to be there be there is a setup

434
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,520
That's really because it's not

435
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:13,920
And so mad he decides to explain to Alex a little bit of why the D

436
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,944
Default happens

437
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,736
And this turns

438
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:23,136
Ugly yeah I don't know if that was a wise choice so it's good to get it out there and make sure that I

439
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,952
I don't understand these things no

440
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:32,352
But there are a couple points in this deposition where I got like really deeply uncomfortable and this was one of them

441
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,632
I was like already we are

442
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,656
Off the rails

443
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,192
Chris Jones

444
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,984
Your stand that

445
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,288
You were defaulted by the court here

446
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,592
For among other things

447
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,872
Presenting fabricated

448
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,152
Financial information

449
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,432
Your company

450
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,736
That's not true though understand that's

451
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,504
Profound

452
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,808
That's okay do you understand

453
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,600
That you were defaulted

454
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,904
For refusing to present

455
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,184
Reduce to the plainest

456
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,976
Analytics information

457
00:31:59,232 --> 00:31:59,744
About

Performance understand that

460
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:11,008
That's been said that the judge made when I believe you're frostrune

461
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:14,080
Okay

462
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:18,944
Alice's best friends with one of your main partner share that when you find that out

463
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,344
Who was partner

464
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,136
It when it hits the nosebleed

465
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,928
Which partner of mine

466
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,720
Is Judge Barbara Bellis

467
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:31,488
Best friends

468
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,536
Oh okay

469
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,840
Mr. Jody

470
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:41,984
My

471
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,640
Okay why is mr. Jones whether he could see

472
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,688
Support his claim just now that he made

473
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:57,088
Any version of the presiding judge and he said that he could not remember all the sudden

474
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,672
Alright well

475
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:01,952
We're going to Virginia

476
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,096
So you're you don't remember right even though you just made an assertion of bias against

477
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:08,864
Presiding judge

478
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:15,776
Claiming that she's best friends with the partner of my office

479
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:18,336
Sources

480
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,640
I didn't I didn't ask you your Source One

481
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:24,224
I asked you the partner was remember that

482
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,320
Without reservation information your journalist

483
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:34,208
Oh my God

484
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:40,608
Oh boy that's that's kind of fun because I don't think Alex was

485
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:46,496
Tekton that response at all throwing out these accusations and not like what do you mean by that

486
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:52,896
Shitt I don't want to name a name because then I'm going to end up in a situation where

487
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:59,296
I'm basically accusing the judge and lawyers of being in collusion

488
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:05,696
That might be a problem is Alex believes like does he inherit

489
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:07,744
Do you like almost instinctively just

490
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,144
Hit the mute button whenever whenever he's talking and he says something does he accidentally press his finger on the table just

491
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:20,544
To be like clearly they can't imagine I mean it's it's

492
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,104
It's outrageous this

493
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,896
This response

494
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:31,296
What you have real real weird there with the the way you said oh

495
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:36,672
Tell good degree is Norma lawyer

496
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,744
I feel like this isn't safe

497
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,144
That we are all pretending Norm has any understanding of what's going on at any point side and I think

498
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:52,544
Probably is actually a an objection to be made there

499
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,920
Normal circumstances maybe snide comments are actually a tone problem

500
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:04,320
Alarm for lawyers in this unfortunately you're proposing Alex f****** jump and

501
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,088
He's being

502
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:11,488
A real a******

503
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:17,888
I keep thinking is I need to make sure Alex says as little as possible but we'll get to that later

504
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:22,752
Objection your honor my defendant is a piece of s*** like I would throw that out there like

505
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:29,152
F****** watermelons on his face anything to keep him from Talking does basically tell Alex

506
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:35,552
Okay well that's smart so while to get there and it might only be because I was about to say something

507
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:41,952
Locate a Norman maybe in self-protection mode

508
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,744
More than Alex detection.

509
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,072
But yeah that was chaotic

510
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:52,960
I felt uncomfortable during that approach that of the

511
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:59,360
Oh you're a journalist there's a nice way of like we're not Landing this playing yet you think that you've you found this

512
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,384
Is great place

513
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,432
Were you can stake your claim

514
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:08,832
It's going to be safe for you to say like I'm not going to give up my source it's not a source

515
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,856
Oh you're jealous

516
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:16,256
What about how your corporate representative consistently testified that you are not a journalist

517
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:22,656
Avoid the responsibilities that come with it I wear that

518
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,680
Brown boy

519
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:28,800
So we know that Alex got a loan from his dad to start his business here

520
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,592
What we didn't know

521
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:35,456
It's some other things that his dad did not help

522
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,736
As it turns out

523
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:40,064
In the early days of Alex's career

524
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:45,696
He had his businesses infowars.com LLC

525
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:50,304
And prisonplanet LLC under a holding company

526
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,608
Called Magnolia partners

527
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:56,448
And here is a little bit of a discussion of what that was

528
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,216
Are the

529
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:00,032
Founder and owner of Infowars Health LLC correct

530
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,872
Infowars LLC

531
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,456
Prisonplanet TV LLC

532
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,736
Now those

533
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,904
Companies were previously held by Magnolia limited partnership

534
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,672
Correct

535
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,048
All of them

536
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,888
Import LLC in for zealous

537
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,216
I am not

538
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,568
Really expert on these not get these confused that's why we had

539
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,872
Study hall

540
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,040
What your understanding is

541
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,320
Is the owner of these companies

542
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:46,880
Whether they were ever held by Magnolia limit

543
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,792
Magnolia limited partnership

544
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,656
Was a dental company management bank account used to pay employees by my dad

545
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,728
21 or so

546
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:04,288
It like $10,000 and it has good

547
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,568
Business credit

548
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:06,848
You can get

549
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:07,872
Starting to

550
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,408
Do things online

551
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,224
Celtics and he said

552
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,504
You can have

553
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,552
You have this baggage on this company

554
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:19,392
And that's that's what that Magnolia limited partnership was

555
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,672
And then

556
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,976
You use that as a holding company

557
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,792
Or the three companies I just mentioned correct

558
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,704
It's on record drive me nuts

559
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:36,032
So when you think about getting a loan

560
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:38,848
That's very helpful

561
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:46,272
Getting a corporate bank account that has good credit and money and such

562
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:52,672
It's an entirely different thing like the opportunities that are open to Alex because of his dad

563
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:54,464
Bequeathing him

564
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,536
This corporate bank account is

565
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:03,936
Berry that is a huge privilege that he had a huge step up as opposed to

566
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:10,336
Someone else trying to do the sort of thing that he was doing business loan without collateral

567
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:15,200
Is either a loan shark or you're going away with no money

568
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:15,968
You know

569
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:20,576
The ability to possibly

570
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:28,000
Items on credit ability for him to make his films that he would then resell

571
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:34,400
A lower interest rate beyond what can be considered is

572
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:38,496
Refusing to recognize the ways in which he had

573
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:44,896
Shortcuts in his early career and how those allowed him to create what he was able to create

574
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:47,712
Absolutely

575
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:53,088
Be the weirdest of the deepening of that they comes for this is is

576
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:59,488
His life and his Illusions about himself all the satyr

577
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:02,304
I think about it is like I still can't believe

578
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:08,960
The things that so many people have done for me to get like for me to go to college there was a serious number of people who

579
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:13,568
Had to step up and do a lot of things to help me out you know and even though I

580
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:19,968
Absolutely wasted their work asteroid their Ambitions for me and said that we can okra

581
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:20,992
Crying into the bathroom

582
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:27,648
I will never not recognize what they've done for me and how that got sure here you know like the idea

583
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:34,048
Of me you know I would never be like off I came from nothing and I'm a self-made man but it's the yeah it's abs

584
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:36,096
Search podcast

585
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:42,496
I guess we built entirely sure we could say but it would be ridiculous to imagine that like

586
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,288
That on your side

587
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:50,688
Things that I've been lucky enough that my parents have been able to help with over the course of my life

588
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:57,088
Facilitating to ever be in the position 100 where we were even struggling

589
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,112
I2

590
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:04,512
Build this at the beginning I think is really a weight

591
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:09,376
To self mythology unhealthy

592
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:15,776
It also goes both ways you know you're there is a certain part of that that's also kind of very helpful you know what you were selling your blood you can

593
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:22,176
Can also say if it weren't for my parents I wouldn't be here now what I'm selling my love

594
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:30,368
So Google analytics comes up interesting answers to weather or

595
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:36,512
Or not he uses Google analytics them and not have

596
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,560
You familiar with Google Analytics

597
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,632
Familiar with it yes

598
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:45,728
Google analytics is a program that allows you to track

599
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,592
Traffic and other activity on your website correct

600
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:52,895
Yes

601
00:41:56,735 --> 00:42:01,343
That data is something that you consulted throughout your career to

602
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,367
Learn about

603
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,135
Your websites

604
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:03,903
Performance correct

605
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,439
No

606
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,463
You've never

607
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:11,839
Look at Google analytics data during the course of your career

608
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,631
For what purposes

609
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:19,007
Attitudes generally see how popular that Lisa cytus

610
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:25,663
Isn't that exactly what you just said no to well I didn't look to see how well the site was due

611
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:32,319
I look to see how popular the site was amongst people it's very

612
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,367
No no

613
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:38,463
Alright so

614
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:41,279
Oh is there 100,000 people

615
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:47,935
That's a different thing you got to check its blood pressure

616
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:52,799
Call very very bizarre

617
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:59,199
So Alex I think realizes that he's in shaky territory here so as more

618
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:01,503
Questions are there about these

619
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,039
Districts in watching them

620
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:09,439
He launches into his standard patented ramp Lovett about how you need to bring me the Google

621
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:12,255
It makes no sense bring me Google bring it to him

622
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,303
It was obviously important to you to know

623
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,583
What your websites

624
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,351
Performance

625
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:21,215
Non-traditional corporate media Outlets

626
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:25,823
Prepackaged is what they're going to do and what they're going to say and then and then and then

627
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:26,591
Taylorsville

628
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:31,199
To whatever the corporate bosses say I died fly by the seat of my pants when it comes to

629
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:35,807
The finances and then anyone see stuff in and I'll try to explain this to

630
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:39,135
Interface into Google

631
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,927
So when you say

632
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,207
It's just a bad kid

633
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,743
My Google searches the front end

634
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:47,583
You asked me what you guys did give us the Google

635
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,607
Analytics

636
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:49,631
Like staying

637
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,911
Give me the Google

638
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,471
You go in there and it's just like

639
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,751
Rocket science

640
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:58,335
The guy's Chris Andrews in temperature

641
00:43:59,103 --> 00:43:59,615
Wood

642
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:02,175
Went to a few meetings with life

643
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:06,783
Search engine optimization people to remember cuz they wanted to be more professional

644
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:09,343
They wanted to try to figure out ways

645
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:13,183
So they poked around

646
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,463
I was just like

647
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,743
Flight

648
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,279
Literally

649
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:20,095
And that's the truth

650
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:31,359
Or to see how stories are now linked to where we're going to traffic I mean by that

651
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,943
It was it was on Capital Public site

652
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,991
Understanding

653
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,295
Google Analytics

654
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:41,855
Give me the phone book

655
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:46,719
Forgive me the Library of Congress

656
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:51,583
What

657
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,607
Michigan

658
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,887
I can tell that you're

659
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:00,799
Focus to some extent

660
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:01,567
On

661
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:03,615
Material

662
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,151
Turnover

663
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:05,919
All I'm asking

664
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:07,967
Is

665
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,247
Whether or not

666
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,271
You made effort

667
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,295
First understand

668
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,087
Collier

669
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,367
Website

670
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,135
Who's performing

671
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:15,903
Yes

672
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:22,559
Okay that's all we need

673
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:28,959
Yeah. My partner is has taught elementary school before and that that feeling of like

674
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,239
Alex

675
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:38,687
Ion highway on about something that is now

676
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:45,087
You're talking about so much that media for no question. Answer to the question

677
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:51,487
Larisa has caused problems in the past but right now we're talkin about you I love the idea

678
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:52,767
To that like

679
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:58,655
Going into Google analytics is like rocket science

680
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,447
Kind of ridiculous

681
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:06,847
That is a question that I have is that I feel like it's very clear from The Trial in from these depositions that we've

682
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:13,503
That it has been explained to Alex how bad it is for them to know all the Google analytics data

683
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:19,903
Right well it has to a bit yes I believe so because it's

684
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:25,279
Especially around time of its the primest example

685
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:30,655
Nobody the FBI says no one was killed at Sandy Hook article that Alex put out

686
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:35,519
The intense Spike that came from the publication of that article

687
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:39,103
Leave then the interview with Wolfgang halbig

688
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:45,503
The next day like those trends that you see in that Google Analytics

689
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:51,903
And for his dad to have testified that they try to replicate things that work 12 quarts things

690
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:58,303
I don't work to Alex's best interest

691
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:05,471
Maybe made him aware of the Optics of that being incredibly bad

692
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,751
Send that I have is

693
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:08,799
If that was explained to him

694
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:15,455
Then there has to have been up there has to have been meetings or something groups of them

695
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:21,855
Heather Wright and I would like to know what else was explained as the line imagine

696
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,903
Maybe a lawyer maybe a norm

697
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:30,303
Conversation I don't know though I mean like we are speculating quite heavily

698
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:36,703
That's what I'd like to you know if I had my druthers of if I could be on the wall in it

699
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:43,103
The ambiguity that's so clear about

700
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:48,223
About the Google analytics be like

701
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:54,879
Wishi-washi nice and refusal to say anything specific about liked a daunting

702
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,903
You things

703
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:01,535
Shoot the facts of them as they are be established and you have to accept them

704
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:05,375
You know that looks terrible right you know

705
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:11,775
Looking at what damn batondy did knowing that you told him to do that and that

706
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:18,175
You probably take him to do that totally you know that any right-thinking person is going to look at that be like you

707
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:21,247
To harass the people in Sandy Hook

708
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,039
So I'm going to say I did

709
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:28,159
You know you can't accept that conclusion until everything has to be done to

710
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:35,327
Serta wiggle around it and there are several of those things that came that were very clear as we go through

711
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,095
Through like

712
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:42,495
Because there's a company line you know if you see Daria Brittany and Owen and everybody say the same thing

713
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:46,591
Then it's kind of clear that it's been disseminated through the group

714
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,383
This is our line you know

715
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:50,943
There were a bunch of things though where it's like

716
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:57,343
This could have been the line or they could have just had no idea that this line of questioning was going to show up

717
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:04,255
So I will be interested to know what it was that they were prepared for and that way sure I would be

718
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:09,887
Could be interesting is that you can tell if you listen to these

719
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:15,775
Bulk of things that the answer is I don't know

720
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:22,175
Yeah and then there're other things were there's a rant and that is notable to me I don't know

721
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:25,503
What exactly it means but yeah it does give the appearance of that

722
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:28,063
So the question comes up of

723
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:31,903
Hey buddy do you know any shows that do what you do

724
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:38,303
Especially

725
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:43,167
At the time they were similar size

726
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:45,983
Any show that you can name

727
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:49,567
Talk about Sandy Hook like you did Alex's trouble with that

728
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,127
At least as of 2012

729
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,479
There was nobody else

730
00:49:57,503 --> 00:50:00,575
Getting in the American Media landscape that was doing what you were

731
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:02,623
Are safe natural form

732
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:04,927
No that's not true

733
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:05,695
Okay

734
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:08,767
Who who else had an audience of your size

735
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:09,791
Open

736
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,327
That was

737
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,119
Covering things the way you covered

738
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,399
Chichen Itza

739
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,935
Forum

740
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:16,959
Okay

741
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:19,263
Anybody else

742
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,311
There were

743
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,127
Hundreds of popular shows

744
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,431
Substantive audiences

745
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:28,991
Anybody anybody else among those shows that has

746
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,271
Substantive audiences

747
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,807
Hoax

748
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:39,487
There there were out of there was a show as big as mind saying that

749
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:42,303
But that would definitely a lot of things a lot of people that

750
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:44,095
Radio shows thanks

751
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,631
Can you name me one person

752
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:47,423
Who had a radio show

753
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:49,471
Who claimed the Sandy Hook was a hoax

754
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:50,495
I just sit here today

755
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,031
Other than you

756
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:55,615
I don't have a computer in front

757
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:59,455
There were people that questioned it definitely was a big controversy

758
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:01,759
People to cover the controversy

759
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:06,111
Garrison Keillor was all over it

760
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:12,511
There was a there was a radio host in Lake Wobegon who was really on The Cutting Edge of this stuff

761
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:18,911
Broadcast that was

762
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:19,679
Strangely enough

763
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,471
All about Sandy Hook for a while

764
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:27,871
This is going to really be shocking but fresh was

765
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:34,271
The largely about Sandy Hook being a hoax for about 6 months

766
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:36,831
Pictures of lolbit weird like that

767
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:43,487
All Things Considered do they consider all things I think they do within the name

768
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:49,887
If they did consider all things that they would have considered this so I think that's a tautology

769
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:55,519
Logically

770
00:51:55,775 --> 00:52:01,919
Discussion about the Second Amendment of course cuz always and

771
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:04,991
Expectation that you talked about the importance of the executive Med B

772
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,015
Defensively

773
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:08,319
Defensive

774
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:14,719
Oh and Maddie gives a couple of points of like we eventually you're going to need to

775
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:21,119
To fight this oppressive government you're going to need to use those guns in an offense

776
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:27,263
The gun is for shooting

777
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:28,287
Yeah

778
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:32,383
Alright we're going to have to fight you up

779
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:33,919
Part of this

780
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,199
Resistance

781
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:35,967
2

782
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:38,271
The global New World Order

783
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,551
You'd agree with me

784
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,599
That your view is that

785
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:42,623
An armed populace

786
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:44,159
Populace may be necessary to

787
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,183
Correct

788
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:51,583
Yes if you can we get invaded during a z, Collapse by

789
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,143
Horses

790
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:57,215
Champs

791
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:01,311
Then people do have a right to duty to protect themselves or family that's

792
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:04,639
Shrine for it's also the first amendment isn't trying

793
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:06,943
What was speak up so we don't ever have to use

794
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:09,247
The Second Amendment on automata wide-scale

795
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,271
What is nothing

796
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,807
That these globalists

797
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:12,831
Won't do

798
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,367
Write to achieve global.

799
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:15,647
Right

800
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:21,023
There's not much they won't accuse them of doing is manufacturing

801
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,559
The covid crisis

802
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:24,863
As a way to depopulate correct

803
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:28,703
Never said I was cooked up by a Consortium of globalist

804
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:31,519
Hundred percent Bill Gates

805
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:37,151
And of course fauci and and develops at the North Carolina Chapel Hill facility

806
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:39,455
The movie 2015 to Wuhan

807
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:43,039
Documents

808
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:47,135
Personalized weapon

809
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:51,487
Of course naturally

810
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:58,143
I love that response to him saying these things because it's just rolls off my back

811
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:01,983
Like water on a duck you know the the I've got all the documents

812
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,263
Be responsive

813
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:09,663
You got all the documents it like it's so funny because you just

814
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:11,455
Expect like the

815
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:17,855
Could you produce them the answers of course I'll do it with you tomorrow

816
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:24,255
Bloomberg email that's fun

817
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:30,655
The idea I never said that it had not occurred to me before that the 1st Amendment was there to keep the

818
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:37,055
The 2nd Amendment from being used see that makes sense while the Second Amendment is unfortunate you know you

819
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:43,455
You need it but it is a method of Last Resort

820
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:49,855
Listen it's okay to talk right but when the talking's done you got to do the shooting First Amendment stalking Second Amendment

821
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:56,255
Here is the reality is mightier than the sword the gun more powerful.

822
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:08,799
I ate ya tongue swordpack I got the tongue of the pen mixed up but it's all speech

823
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:15,199
Talking about you can see there to something that I believe is

824
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:21,087
Thread of questioning that goes on through this will do anything

825
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:22,623
They will do anything

826
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:29,023
I told Maddie does lineup a list of like these things that Alex is called false Flags Oklahoma City

827
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,303
City Columbine

828
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:34,655
Got all this and I think part of it is to make it like

829
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:37,983
Why would it be any more extreme for them to

830
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:42,079
Do Sandy Hook and you are mine would do anything

831
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:46,687
It's not really that outside your ideas at all

832
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:53,343
It's almost weird sense of like normalizing it within his ideology

833
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:59,743
To be adverse to be like well I wouldn't say that they do this or something with everything that you say

834
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:06,143
Right right right it's priming him to be more receptive to just be like it

835
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:11,007
You know I think I think that there's a piece of that whether it's intentional or not

836
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:17,151
But yeah it goes through a number of these shootings and

837
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:22,015
Terrorist false Flags to Alex's covered and one of them stuck out to me

838
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:25,087
Dead in 2011 you claimed

839
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:28,415
The shooting of congresswoman

840
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,439
Gabby Giffords

841
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,463
Which took the lives

842
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:32,511
Six people and wounded 13

843
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,047
With a staged

844
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,071
Operate

845
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:35,839
Correct

846
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:40,191
He was mentally ill and I believe May been under my control football

847
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,215
What you said was

848
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:42,495
It was a stage

849
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:43,263
Operation

850
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,031
Correct

851
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:47,615
I can contact. But the camera

852
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:48,895
And and

853
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:50,943
Who is it that you said was under mind control

854
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:53,759
Individual that did the shooting

855
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,415
He was an audience member of yours was in Ark

856
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:02,975
I don't know that

857
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:07,583
Yeah so there's a there's a couple things here first is that

858
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:14,495
You know Alex has these grandiose ideas about like all this is a mind control person with a f****** name

859
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:18,079
Don't care about this at all you just have like a little bit of a

860
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:24,479
I detail that you remember like oh that's if you actually

861
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:28,575
We thought this person was like a mind control subject to try to kill

862
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:31,391
Gabby Giffords and killed a bunch of other people

863
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:34,463
Frankie it would be maybe a more important data point

864
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,999
You know in the

865
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:39,071
Cosmology of your ideas

866
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:44,447
If you could prove to me that somebody had been mind-controlled

867
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:47,775
Into attempting to assassinate a political figure

868
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:54,687
That would be the only thing I'm interested in moving forward we got to figure out this mind-control s*** cuz I can't

869
00:57:54,943 --> 00:58:01,087
Anyone is saying to me anymore imagine imagine if Alex dedicated himself to proving anyting

870
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:03,903
As opposed to just deciding everything is proven

871
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:10,559
W mind control I am on your team because f*** if I know what I believe is true NE

872
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:13,887
Seymour everybody's mind-controlled its mind control is possible

873
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:15,423
Yeah

874
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:22,079
Well I mean then again to the whole like now

875
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:28,479
Coffee table that I'm fine I don't care this Gabby Giffords shooting is part of a line of like

876
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:32,063
Like you know Columbine all of these shootings

877
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:36,927
The intention behind this is to demonstrate to Alex that there is a pattern

878
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:38,207
It is very clear

879
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:40,255
And that is the day of these things

880
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:46,655
You say they're fake that is what you do your audience expects it is just how this works

881
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:52,543
And so we get to the Aurora shooting and Alex tries to play dumb on that one

882
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:54,079
And then

883
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:56,383
In July 2012

884
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,663
We have the Aurora movie

885
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:58,943
Theater shooting correct

886
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:04,063
In there on that very day on the day of the shooting

887
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,623
You going to do the hundred percent chance that it was a false

888
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:07,391
Correct

889
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:11,231
I believe that was a few days later what was the local newspaper

890
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:12,767
But he told

891
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:16,863
People in the jail the guards that he was under mind control are you denying

892
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,167
That on the day of the shooting itself

893
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:21,215
You said there was a hundred percent chance

894
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:21,983
It was a false flag

895
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:24,799
You know you said that

896
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:25,567
Don't you

897
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:28,127
I know I don't know that I said I don't have a phone

898
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:30,431
Why don't we show

899
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:32,223
Exhibit 102a

900
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:39,647
That's got to be a nightmare trying to play fast and loose gear

901
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:46,047
And when I hear let's play this clip alright now I'm going to watch myself say the thing I was trying to be

902
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:50,143
A little bit cagey about the idea of

903
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:55,519
Being in a deposition and saying I believe something happened to the lawyer

904
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:57,055
Who you know

905
00:59:57,311 --> 01:00:03,455
Knows the answer to every question he's not asking questions for information Mansi Alexander

906
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:09,855
He's operating he's operating on the Assumption of like alright this lawyer knows the answer to

907
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:12,415
The 99% of the questions

908
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:18,815
And they only want me to answer that 1% because that'll really screw me over so if I if I just pretend

909
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:23,423
Do not know anything that's how I'm going to get around I don't know maybe that's the thing

910
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,447
Thought process but

911
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,983
It's it's a little bit.

912
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:30,591
So if they play the clip of Alex saying that this is

913
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:31,359
Awesome

914
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:34,943
This is a great attempt on Alex's BART to weasel away

915
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,991
July 20th

916
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:37,759
2000

917
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:39,039
At 12

918
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:47,743
At the beginning of the video horse that Infowars live

919
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:48,767
You know that

920
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:52,095
Refresh my memory

921
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:55,935
You said it was

922
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:56,959
100%

923
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:58,495
Right

924
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:01,055
Play on words chance

925
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:04,895
What

926
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:06,431
Yeah.

927
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:10,783
Okay

928
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:17,183
You see it was eloquent wordplay

929
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:23,583
More empty Alex's resultant resided himself toward gay

930
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:27,679
The language that uses it was a pun

931
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:34,079
That's not going to work man

932
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:40,479
Great that's fantastic like one of the things that I really enjoy about these depositions

933
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:46,879
Is that like that's unnecessary Alex grasping at straws for no reason at all

934
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:52,767
It is it is all too often like the kids say the darndest things would like

935
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:56,095
Why would you say that you child

936
01:01:56,607 --> 01:02:02,751
It's so easy for Alex just admit that he said that because there's a video of it

937
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:09,151
I don't know or that was my belief at the time total or whatever

938
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:15,551
Visalia like a word

939
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:21,951
Reasonable if you didn't remember that you said that on the day you say bulshit everyday you don't care what you

940
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:26,303
You say of course you don't remember you said it on that day

941
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:30,399
Probably if you ask me I totally did

942
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:36,799
So we get to Sandy Hook and of course the pattern has been established through this line of questions that the day of these tree

943
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:43,199
Tragedies you deny that breath what you do your audience knows the game and Alex

944
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:48,319
Someone kind of shocked me was the question comes up whether or not he watched

945
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:50,367
His show from that day

946
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:52,671
To prepare for any of these cases

947
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:58,815
And I would have thought you probably watched mean at least a little bit beyond two times speed

948
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:00,351
After having

949
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:03,167
Claimed your audience of Millions

950
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:05,727
Each of the events

951
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:06,751
We just went through

952
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,543
We're staged

953
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,079
The government

954
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:15,199
You went on the air on

955
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:17,759
December 14th 2012

956
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:22,879
Discuss shooting that happened that morning in Connecticut correct

957
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:24,927
Yes

958
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:32,607
Good morning of December 14th 2012

959
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:37,471
Adam Lanza shot his way into Sandy Hook Elementary

960
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,031
Yes

961
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:42,079
Killed 20 children and six adults

962
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,103
Yes

963
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:45,919
You at your studio in Texas that day right

964
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:51,551
Appalachia and your show aired its regular time 11 a.m. Central

965
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:56,927
And you started talking about Sandy Hook

966
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:00,767
Felicia

967
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:02,815
And you knew exactly what you were going to say

968
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:05,887
No

969
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:11,775
Cover guy was recovering what the news was up to before saying call her for calling you

970
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:14,591
Well no caller that called in told you

971
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:16,127
What stage did they

972
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:19,967
I haven't reviewed that show

973
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:21,759
You produced it. Did you know that

974
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:24,575
I told him give you everything we had

975
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:25,599
You didn't think that

976
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:27,135
I want to review

977
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:28,927
Your broadcast from the Day this year

978
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,207
Jackson

979
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:38,655
I really try to not think about Sandy Hook because

980
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:43,007
I get bombarded with it so I'm leaving

981
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:44,031
Rochester

982
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:47,103
There was a pause there in that

983
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:49,407
And that is kind of like him realizing

984
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:55,807
It does look bad that I didn't I didn't review this

985
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:59,135
What do you say I don't like to think about Sandy Hook

986
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:00,159
Or whatever

987
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:02,975
I'm saying I don't face what I did

988
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:04,767
That is

989
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:08,351
Entirely I'm too much of a coward to own up to the fact

990
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:11,423
That I behave this way and it cause this much pain

991
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:13,983
Name two people yeah I mean well that part of that

992
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:15,519
Was

993
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:19,615
It literally never occurred to me to do so that is not something I want to do

994
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:26,015
I have built up psychological roadblocks that won't allow me to even come close

995
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:31,391
Reckoning with my own action never occurred to me

996
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:33,695
So ugly

997
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:40,607
It's pretty important to understand and recognize especially in hindsight that Alex when he got on air

998
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:41,887
That they had no information

999
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:46,751
Looks like a false flag that looks fake

1000
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:47,775
You're nothing

1001
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:54,175
Other than himself same thing that we were looking at he was looking at and he had no more information than us

1002
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:56,479
He did not call it a false flag

1003
01:05:56,735 --> 01:06:01,855
Has these quote-unquote anomalies that he can look at and say like that

1004
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:08,255
You know any insight use that to justify his suspicion was anywhere

1005
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:12,863
In his mind immediately there were no of these anomalies

1006
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:15,679
Comes up and this is weird

1007
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:20,287
I'm sure you'll do bring them up

1008
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:24,127
It was the reports of multiple Shooters the man of the woods the camo

1009
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:27,199
Some of the

1010
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:29,503
Responses and things

1011
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:33,343
About the First Responders and meet Sweet seen other events we had questions about

1012
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:40,511
Information about with you and you want to meet

1013
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:42,815
Performance

1014
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:47,679
I need to go back to the timetable that but if I'm sitting there

1015
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:48,959
Saying

1016
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:53,823
Just to be staged

1017
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:55,103
You then

1018
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:58,175
I told the video that you published

1019
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:02,527
Connecticut school massacre looks like false

1020
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:04,063
Witnesses

1021
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,903
I do remember that but that's it

1022
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:12,255
You title you title your own videos right

1023
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:13,535
That's your pride

1024
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:17,631
It is generally like to try the title some of the videos

1025
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:19,423
It's your practice to do it

1026
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:20,959
Definition

1027
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:22,239
Didn't do it yesterday

1028
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:27,103
Sunday no I don't do it all the time.

1029
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:28,895
Hugo Acosta was your lungs

1030
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:32,223
Curious

1031
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:33,503
He was your lungs

1032
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:38,111
Yes but that is different and he and he

1033
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:39,647
Test

1034
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:47,071
Single Witness

1035
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:47,839
Spoke to

1036
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:49,631
You can speak to any Witness

1037
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:50,655
Is that day Witness

1038
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:51,679
Incorrect

1039
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:55,007
Watching it on television and Witnesses for saying

1040
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:58,335
You were watching Witnesses on television speed

1041
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:02,431
Watching people are saying on television not a single Witness

1042
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:06,527
I don't know that

1043
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:12,159
A witness

1044
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:14,975
You saw news reports that day

1045
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:18,047
As you're watching as you were broadcasting

1046
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:22,143
I think we're playing for the news reports on your life as you were broadcast

1047
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,679
And you think

1048
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:27,263
And in one of those news reports included what an interview a witness

1049
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:31,103
I will go back and I will review that that first day I didn't

1050
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,063
Witness

1051
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:41,855
On the air

1052
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:43,647
Told you

1053
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:45,439
That the massacre look like

1054
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:46,463
Flag

1055
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:52,095
I haven't reviewed the broadcasts a while I should coming on

1056
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,119
Okay

1057
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:54,143
So you have

1058
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:55,167
No idea

1059
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:56,703
Weather anyway

1060
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:59,519
Did the shooting ever said that left

1061
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:00,799
Incorrect

1062
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:04,639
You lived

1063
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:06,943
10 years ago

1064
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:13,599
So yeah this line of questioning is like just a disastrous

1065
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:19,999
Falling off a cliff for Alex the the title of that video

1066
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:24,863
Shooting looks like a false flag such a disaster because

1067
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:31,519
Question the follow-up obviously is what

1068
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:36,383
Brides and you can't answer that because you don't have an answer to that

1069
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:42,783
Yeah it is it is interesting to look at somebody till like watch in real time as somebody

1070
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:49,183
Finally sees themselves from the outside you know like cuz he inside he's like okay you know what I did

1071
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:50,207
Did some bad things

1072
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,231
But I'm not

1073
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:51,999
Guilty

1074
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:56,095
You know and then whatever he sees himself through that lens of like

1075
01:09:56,607 --> 01:10:02,751
Oh I really can't explain that I really can't look the most guilty anyone's ever look are you trying to tell me you turned on

1076
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:06,335
CNN and a witness to the shooting said it looks fake

1077
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:13,247
Well now with that you say it like that cuz that's where your headline did you have

1078
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:16,575
Conversations with Witnesses who told you that affair

1079
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:22,975
What's going on here none of this is like you woke up really really sleepy you were

1080
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:24,767
Paying attention and your friends

1081
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:31,167
Had put you inside a dolphin costume and you went to the liquor store and you were like

1082
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:36,031
Something and everybody's like you are wearing a dolphin costume

1083
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:42,943
So this next clip is a little bit longer I'm going to say Mike down for this even though it's about 4 minutes

1084
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:44,735
And the reason is because this is

1085
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:51,135
Pretty intense the question is about the Rob

1086
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:57,535
Robbie Parker press conference as we know Alex basically just played the first 2 seconds of

1087
01:10:58,047 --> 01:11:02,399
And the question has to do with whether or not he ever even watch the full

1088
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:03,935
Conference

1089
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:07,263
Simple yes or no question

1090
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,799
You have just described

1091
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:15,455
Is going to lead to a four-minute clip that I have to put my bike down for it takes

1092
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:19,039
Turn

1093
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:20,575
Now that day

1094
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:22,111
After the

1095
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,135
Sandy Hook

1096
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,183
Tragedy

1097
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:31,327
Father one of the children spoke to the Press outside

1098
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:32,095
Church

1099
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:34,143
Did you know that

1100
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:37,215
Did you watch that live

1101
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:42,591
OverWatch live

1102
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:48,991
When did you want

1103
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:53,343
I know I've watched the Robbie Parker videos Arizona

1104
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:55,903
I'm talking about

1105
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:57,695
The statement that mister Parker

1106
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:58,463
Poker games

1107
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:00,255
Shooting

1108
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:06,143
I've had watched it many times and I wash it near the back of that time I don't remember

1109
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:10,239
10 years later how I watched it exactly when I watched it

1110
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:11,775
Watch the whole thing

1111
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:15,615
I want some

1112
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:17,663
What is the whole thing again

1113
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:20,479
Empire State

1114
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:21,759
Depressed

1115
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:24,831
I remember watching the whole press conference

1116
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:26,879
Let's play

1117
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:29,439
And you think you did it around a Time

1118
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:40,191
I mean really yeah I mean I know the statement I know you're talkin about I don't remember when I exactly I watched it

1119
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:41,215
10 years ago

1120
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:44,799
What was this child's name

1121
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,079
Murdered at Sandy

1122
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,943
Can you name a single person whose murder

1123
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:55,807
The time we said some of the names but I've

1124
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:58,111
Most people sue me I never said their names

1125
01:12:58,367 --> 01:12:59,135
So

1126
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:00,671
Like I said I'm not

1127
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:04,255
Edited or something

1128
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:05,791
Mr. Jones

1129
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:07,583
Do you know the name of

1130
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:14,751
Tell me what

1131
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:17,311
Answer your attitude or something I'm not giving you what you want

1132
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:18,591
Oh yes you are

1133
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:22,175
You want to make some section affectionate.

1134
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:23,967
I want to

1135
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:26,015
See whether you're lying or not when you say you know them

1136
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:27,039
Noah Pozner

1137
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:27,807
Okay

1138
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:28,831
Can you give me another one

1139
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:30,111
I'm done can you

1140
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:34,719
I didn't kill those children can you get it with no people in the public appearance that killed him

1141
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:37,279
I'm not going to say their names so you can

1142
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:41,375
Edit together act like I did something to him if there's a there's a court record what you say here

1143
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:43,167
So other than the whole post

1144
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:44,447
Can you name a single per

1145
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:45,471
He was murdered at 10

1146
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:50,591
Yes and I'm done doing parlor tricks

1147
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:51,359
Who

1148
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:52,895
If you're going answer the question

1149
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:01,087
We just took a break

1150
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:02,367
Can you name a single

1151
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,391
Person who was murdered

1152
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:04,159
Sandy Hook

1153
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:09,023
Yes if I need to

1154
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:15,679
Going my mind and dredged up my mobile can but I'm not going to sit here and say their names for you so you can have something for HBO movie

1155
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:18,239
Mr. Jones this is a lawsuit

1156
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:19,775
Brought by

1157
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:21,055
People whose

1158
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:22,079
Children loved one

1159
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,103
What killed

1160
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:27,711
Nobody said they know they will know

1161
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:30,271
Okay

1162
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:32,063
But the General Public

1163
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:34,111
Mr. Jones

1164
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:37,183
The question before you

1165
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:39,487
Is whether you're capable

1166
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:42,815
Stating the name

1167
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:43,583
Any other

1168
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:53,311
I mean I can probably Drive some samba names when I'm done I'm done

1169
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,079
No you're not.

1170
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:56,383
So the answer is no

1171
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:58,431
You can't do it sure I can do it

1172
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:01,759
That's is

1173
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:03,295
Heavy-duty yeah

1174
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:05,087
Yeah it makes me think

1175
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:06,111
That

1176
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:08,415
As as bad as it was

1177
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:12,255
I do think that when Alex was on the stand

1178
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:14,559
Both Mark and Chris

1179
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:15,583
Had to of

1180
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:21,983
Maintains a large amount of restraint because they clearly know where to press the button to

1181
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,263
Make Alex dance

1182
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,287
You know like

1183
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:27,871
If they wanted to make Alex really explode

1184
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:29,407
They had the buttons

1185
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:31,967
I think I think probably yeah

1186
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:36,319
Yeah I think they chose to make sure that he only exploded as much as he did

1187
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:42,719
Well yeah you don't want to derail things too much I believe

1188
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:49,119
And Maddie does point this out and touch on this

1189
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:50,655
Partner's name because

1190
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:55,775
He use the picture of him when they had the shooting in Pakistan

1191
01:15:56,799 --> 01:16:01,407
That's Lenny his father gave him a

1192
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:03,455
A strike a copyright strike for

1193
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:06,783
That name is somebody that Alex is actually

1194
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:10,111
I've had much more engagement with because

1195
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,135
Of the

1196
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:12,671
Harassing of

1197
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:15,487
Mr. Posner over the picture of his son

1198
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:17,279
Yep and so the

1199
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:20,607
Question of what are any of these peoples names

1200
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:23,423
I don't think Alex does know any of them

1201
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:30,079
And it's an interesting Dodge to be like they're just going to edit this together in some kind of way like what kind of way

1202
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:34,943
Are you worried about people editing you saying someone's name about like that's absurd

1203
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:37,759
It's clearly evading

1204
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:43,135
Having to recognize publicly that you don't care enough about this at all

1205
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:46,719
To even know the names of the people who were murdered that you have

1206
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:49,791
Blind the only people

1207
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:50,559
Quotes

1208
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:51,583
Editing this

1209
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:53,887
Or putting it out even a little bit

1210
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:54,911
R Us

1211
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:57,215
And it sounds way worse when you say that

1212
01:16:57,471 --> 01:17:03,615
And if you said no yeah we both would have been like well yeah of course he doesn't know any of those and I would still think that's worth,

1213
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:10,015
Oh I was honest about it that no Sky Fiat and I don't think

1214
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:13,599
I probably play it like a four-minute clip

1215
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:19,999
2 if he had you no honor the memories of the people you know

1216
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:26,399
And recognize that he did understand the scope of the impact

1217
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:29,727
Want people to cuz it is hard to really like

1218
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:31,263
Grass this but

1219
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:33,823
If Alex had done that

1220
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:40,735
You would have cut that clip and we would have both been like can you believe this like it would not have been something like

1221
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:47,135
This doesn't fit within our narrative we bought that beat hell yeah put that in there it would be very interesting

1222
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:51,231
To have this demonstration of Alex having some Reckoning

1223
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:57,631
Of his own action total time spent thinking about it I'm under

1224
01:17:57,887 --> 01:18:04,031
Standing public is no worthy as what just happened

1225
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:10,175
Totally and what happened another way to go

1226
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:13,759
So Alex said

1227
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:15,039
Robbie Parker

1228
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:16,063
Was acting

1229
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:18,623
In the press conference

1230
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:20,159
Unfortunately

1231
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:26,047
Seems like he's still kind of thinks that what he was doing tonight

1232
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:49,087
Deposit

1233
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:53,695
Do you watch that

1234
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:54,463
Set the time

1235
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:03,935
Mister Parker acting

1236
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:04,703
When

1237
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:07,519
His daughter Emily

1238
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:09,567
Being somebody would have been

1239
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:10,335
The first

1240
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:16,479
Was he acting when he said that

1241
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:20,063
Nectifirm

1242
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:24,671
But it's time

1243
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:26,719
You thought he was acting when he described

1244
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:27,743
His daughters

1245
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:28,511
Personalities

1246
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:29,279
Is being one who

1247
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:30,815
Wood Consulting

1248
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:32,863
Yes

1249
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:40,543
In the classic area of activity doesn't, but I understand sometimes Highway

1250
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:42,335
Car stereo

1251
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:47,967
If Amy looks like it sounds like

1252
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:50,783
Also thought that

1253
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:54,367
Complex ways people deal with things that were more years

1254
01:19:58,207 --> 01:20:01,279
Mainstream media live so much that people lost faith in the system

1255
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:05,375
So many times it's not true of people conduit

1256
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:07,423
Mychelle because I do question everything

1257
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,471
I'm also made mistakes in the process

1258
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:11,007
Mr. Jones

1259
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:12,543
The

1260
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:18,688
That looks you like

1261
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:19,456
Academy Award

1262
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:27,392
What I'm telling you is that

1263
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:28,160
Directions to

1264
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:34,304
You just described it as it looks like Academy award-winning appenzell you right there's a fire

1265
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:38,144
Right now it's just a second ago you were sitting here

1266
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:42,752
You said that that looks like Academy award-winning acting to you doesn't it okay

1267
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:50,688
Gross and I think I think you are totally right about the button and I think that one of the buttons

1268
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:55,552
Is making Alex watch the stuff that he lied about

1269
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:56,832
You know like it

1270
01:20:57,344 --> 01:21:03,488
So easy for him to look at that two seconds of Robbie Parker appearing to laugh or

1271
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:09,888
Whatever and run with that but what he has a very serious aversion to is having

1272
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:10,912
In his face

1273
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:12,448
This press conference

1274
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:15,520
That is like this is what you were calling acting

1275
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:16,800
You know like this

1276
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:23,200
If you are saying that you watched the whole thing this is what you're lying about not just

1277
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:26,272
That little snippet you're lying about all of this

1278
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:32,672
And I think that Alex human-level recognizes his monsters

1279
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:37,792
Yeah it isn't like being a monster it is a little bit like

1280
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:43,936
Picture of Dorian Gray kind of s*** right there like he just cannot bring himself to look at what he actually is

1281
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:45,984
Yeah so fascinating

1282
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,288
Cuz it's 8:00 yet

1283
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:54,944
He knows what he is he can't not know but to be confronted with it they somehow

1284
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:55,712
Different

1285
01:21:56,224 --> 01:22:00,064
It's fascinated really is it's like what happens to human brain

1286
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:06,464
You know you what you want to study is that you dislike ICD Ysidro donate his brain to science after he died

1287
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:09,280
Convert this couldn't it couldn't hurt

1288
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:15,168
We could learn something at least we could throw his brain around like a football another option

1289
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:19,008
Could just be booze

1290
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,312
There is something

1291
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:26,688
A dynamic scented play here that I think is really also a button

1292
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:28,736
For Alex and that is

1293
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:34,624
Questioning his integrity and questioning his bravery

1294
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:41,024
She has none. Bookout's use willing to admit that he thought that this look like

1295
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,840
Like actic but for some reason

1296
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:44,864
He is

1297
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:51,264
Really refusing to say that he called Robbie Parker and actor which he absolutely did

1298
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:54,592
I'm so Maddie is pushing on that and then biscuits

1299
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:55,872
F****** ugly

1300
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,408
When you claimed

1301
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,456
Robbie Parker was a crisis at

1302
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:02,272
What you were claiming

1303
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:04,576
Was that he was fabricating

1304
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:05,344
And wine

1305
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:07,392
Star correct

1306
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:10,208
No no

1307
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:11,488
How could you be a nap

1308
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:14,304
Lying

1309
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:15,840
About the death of his

1310
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:17,888
Instill

1311
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:28,384
We look at all of these events and some of it stays some haven't been and everybody questions things more than ever now

1312
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,432
Explain to you

1313
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:35,296
That the internet said they thought it was fake I looked up Ciara looks like he's acting

1314
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:39,392
And then and then and I went back and forth whether it happened or not

1315
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:42,208
A long before I got sued I said no I think it happen

1316
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:48,608
I mean

1317
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:50,656
Question

1318
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,984
You like to tell your audience that you're the tip of the spear

1319
01:23:55,776 --> 01:24:01,152
That's what you say I want to come

1320
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:07,040
That's what you prefer yourself as right

1321
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:08,576
Nea

1322
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,648
You already even willing to sit here Underoath

1323
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,720
Any knowledge what you

1324
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:17,792
Robbie

1325
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:21,120
Enact

1326
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:22,656
Acknowledging

1327
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:25,472
That what you were saying was

1328
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:26,240
Mister

1329
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,032
Parker

1330
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:28,800
Fabricating

1331
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:34,176
Isn't that what

1332
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:43,904
This is what this is acting this is for HBO on your career you're the one that live off of Tango kids

1333
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,696
Going on around here

1334
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:58,752
His dad lied about being in Vietnam and combats you guys are all fake

1335
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:12,320
Subjects which is what we're getting along just know that his dad never went about it stolen Glory

1336
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:13,344
Okay

1337
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,648
You're wrong.

1338
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:18,208
You want you want to I mean we can stay here third day

1339
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:23,840
And you can go on your ass like you're on your lunch or whatever you want

1340
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:27,168
Mr. Jones

1341
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:30,240
Instantly destroyed for lack

1342
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:31,776
Yeah it's a mess

1343
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:34,848
Yeah I would move to strike that for just general

1344
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:41,248
Good person reasons to have a little bit of an outburst cuz he has a flair for the

1345
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:43,808
Dramatic at the same time

1346
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:50,464
This is coming out of a question that he can't face

1347
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:51,744
That you said

1348
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:58,144
You know you're supposed to be this person who at is principles and in all this anyway

1349
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:04,544
Yet you lack the spine to even just sit here and own up to the mistakes that you've made

1350
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,080
If this is a mistake

1351
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:12,480
And you just got something wrong you had some bad sources or whatever why why can't you just

1352
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:14,784
Admit you said he was an actor

1353
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:21,184
And what that entails what that implies death get the Dodge this was like oh the internet started look like acting and I said remake

1354
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:27,584
Maybe it look like acting in your own backstory in order to make it more palatable

1355
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:30,656
You can't admit it to yourself

1356
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:31,424
Yep

1357
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:38,080
Howard a big dog and you're just a tiny yapping puppy you coward

1358
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:38,848
Week

1359
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:45,248
Week-by-week how is it that you I don't understand how you can have that much bravado

1360
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:47,808
Whenever it is that lack

1361
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:54,208
The tip of the spear is Al Dente noodles

1362
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:55,744
No

1363
01:26:56,256 --> 01:27:02,400
The one of the things that Alex one of his claims in relation to Robbie Parker was that

1364
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:07,008
Prior to him giving his press conference giving him a card of what to say

1365
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:11,104
I like the media or government was telling him what to say

1366
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:11,872
Well

1367
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:13,152
Now sure

1368
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:18,784
And Alex has to deal with the fact that that's based on nothing

1369
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:21,856
I am that was baby out of thin air

1370
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:23,136
A little bit

1371
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:26,464
You see the headline their father of Sandy Hook victim asked

1372
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:27,488
Read the card

1373
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:28,256
Seconds before

1374
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:29,536
Press conference

1375
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,424
When

1376
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,960
We just watch the video you didn't hear

1377
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:43,104
They didn't hear him say read the

1378
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:46,944
Can you play it again for me now

1379
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:48,480
Cuz you just watched it

1380
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:50,784
You didn't hear him say read the card did you

1381
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:51,808
Objection

1382
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:54,112
Start

1383
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:00,512
There's a statement attributed to you

1384
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:01,536
At the bottom

1385
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:04,352
Where it says

1386
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:08,192
In the second sentence after you offer your condolences to miss

1387
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:08,960
Mister Parker

1388
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:16,128
It appears that members of the media or government have given him a card

1389
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:21,504
And are telling him what to say

1390
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:23,296
What you said right

1391
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:27,392
But you said right it appears

1392
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:30,720
That members of the media or government have given him a card

1393
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:31,488
Correct

1394
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:37,376
I guess I picked up on some of that there yeah I don't ever remember this text is going to make sure you're welcome

1395
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:40,960
Wow did you see anybody in the video that we watched give Mister Parker car

1396
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:44,032
No I must have been complaining it was something about a wrong

1397
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:48,640
Did you see anybody tell him what to

1398
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:49,408
Say

1399
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,808
I wasn't looking for that when you play it can you play it again

1400
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:57,088
I'm just asking

1401
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:01,952
Jackson

1402
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:08,352
Who were the members of the media or the government

1403
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:13,472
Your point

1404
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:15,776
Jefferson question Masky

1405
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:18,592
You you put out a statement

1406
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:22,432
5 days after the shooting that said members of the media or the government

1407
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:26,272
Give him a card or tell me what to say I just asked you

1408
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:27,808
Dragon watch that video

1409
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:30,368
Woody somebody told me

1410
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:33,952
Injection Italian contacts

1411
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:46,240
I told you what I thought he said it's different than what I was saying there so late I think there's that I'm going to watch the video did you see anybody

1412
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:50,592
Tell him what to say

1413
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:53,408
So based on

1414
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:54,944
Yeah

1415
01:29:55,200 --> 01:30:00,576
Yeah it does really seem like Alex does not get the point is genuinely

1416
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:06,976
Yeah it's it's it's almost impossible to tell if he doesn't get the point or if he's just so aware of

1417
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:07,744
I like

1418
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,560
How important it is for him not to get the point

1419
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:16,960
Man just feels like he really doesn't get the point that it feels that way too but it might be naive

1420
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:18,496
He is just a bit like

1421
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:24,640
I don't know I really don't think he can tell the difference between whether or not the things he says are true

1422
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:25,408
Or not true

1423
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:27,200
It might not matter to him

1424
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:31,808
You never think that's clip made me think of that would be an interesting exercise

1425
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:38,720
Take things that Alex has constructed conspiracies out of in the past show him the same Source material and then ask

1426
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:45,120
Ask him what his conspiracy was about it from memory that's a good one

1427
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:51,520
Have you come up with a different computer would like find some of

1428
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:55,616
Other detail and be like oh that must be what I was suspicious about

1429
01:30:56,128 --> 01:31:02,272
Cuz he probably there's probably no consistency right doesn't mean anything let's let's take it the opposite direction

1430
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:04,576
Direction get rid of Alex entirely

1431
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:07,648
But let's grab some of the things that he said

1432
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:08,928
And convince

1433
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:14,048
Three random strangers to guess the conspiracy theory for money

1434
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:18,656
At the end of the round Whoever has the most money wins so it's not a terrible idea

1435
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:20,960
Another interesting idea would be take

1436
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:27,360
Three things that Alex made a conspiracy out of mno4 thing and see if he could pick out which one was

1437
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:33,760
That wasn't you might find suspicious

1438
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:37,600
Makeup a similar conspiracy theory

1439
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:44,000
And see if he can tell the difference between them whether or not there's what detail is different between your version and the made-up version

1440
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:50,400
Apply the scientific method

1441
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:55,776
None of this is repeatable

1442
01:31:56,032 --> 01:31:58,592
One thing I found pretty disgusting

1443
01:31:58,848 --> 01:32:04,992
Was that other purely play the clip of Robbie Parker for Alex

1444
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:05,760
Engineer

1445
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:07,040
Your Alex laugh

1446
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:08,576
Keep playing

1447
01:32:16,768 --> 01:32:20,352
Play Robbie Parker

1448
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:24,192
He seems to not really appreciate the gravity of

1449
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:27,264
The situation in the context of stuff

1450
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,544
To the point where he

1451
01:32:29,568 --> 01:32:30,848
Still thinks it's funny

1452
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:33,920
The waiver to Robbie Parker walks up to the mic

1453
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:35,200
Yeah that's

1454
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:42,112
I don't have a bowl to me I mean he's he's really moved into the

1455
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:43,136
Uncanny valley

1456
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:44,160
For me I've liked

1457
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:45,952
Human behaviors like

1458
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:52,352
Everything he does so very similarly represent what human would do but then there's something like this where you like

1459
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:56,448
There's something missing man there's something missing something

1460
01:32:56,704 --> 01:33:01,568
Something's not there I don't know what it is but your unlike all the other humans that I know

1461
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:07,968
Yeah yeah I don't know if it's something that's missing or something that's trained it's been sort of ingrained in him

1462
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:13,600
Overtime

1463
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:18,464
I mean obviously we wouldn't be at 700-plus episodes about somebody who wasn't like

1464
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:20,000
You are

1465
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:26,400
You are not like other people or a unique person who have commanded 750

1466
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:32,544
Episodes of our show I will I will give you that you are uniquely f***** up

1467
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:37,920
So Maddie points out to Alex if he lies everyday

1468
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:39,968
This is not taken well

1469
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:46,368
Why not

1470
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:51,232
Oh really

1471
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:55,840
So why you got to lie detection

1472
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,936
What are the times

1473
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:03,520
Was

1474
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:04,800
When

1475
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:06,080
You

1476
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:07,616
Claim

1477
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:10,432
Terraria civilian

1478
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,248
I

1479
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:15,552
I planted c****************

1480
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:17,856
In materials that you sent us

1481
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:18,624
That's correct

1482
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:28,608
Directions

1483
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:31,680
Objection

1484
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:43,456
My partner

1485
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:01,632
Sorry what now

1486
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:09,568
Mr. Jones

1487
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:12,384
You I'm going to ask you

1488
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:13,664
One more time before we

1489
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:23,392
Not because me and said that we file fraudulent financial documents we didn't do that mr. Jones

1490
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:25,440
You did and the court found that you did

1491
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:26,464
Jexi

1492
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:35,936
Oh boy

1493
01:35:37,472 --> 01:35:40,032
Abusing people in this world

1494
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:42,336
Directions didn't stop addressing attorney Blumenthal

1495
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:44,128
Understand that

1496
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:45,664
Stop doing that

1497
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:50,016
Okay yeah things that's a mess

1498
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:56,160
Yeah so yeah the mafia there the mafia and they run the state the courts right

1499
01:35:56,416 --> 01:36:02,560
That was a barrage in a short. Of time really thought about this because it's so bizarre this

1500
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:05,120
It's like this.

1501
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:08,960
She said that you're the mafia or whatever

1502
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:15,360
The only reason that Norm would respond the way he did is if he's involved in this claim

1503
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:21,760
I'm somehow Norm told Alex I feel like that's one of the only conclusion I can come to

1504
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:28,160
Because he sang Just touches on privilege and so it has to do with something that involves confidential

1505
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:30,208
Russians that he had with Alex

1506
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:34,560
And so I don't I don't know what to make of it exactly but

1507
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:37,632
It's f***** up 50 years old

1508
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:43,776
Bucked up I will I will tell you this and I I swear to you I could be wrong

1509
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:48,896
But this is one of those moments where I feel like I can penetrate the veil so to speak

1510
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:55,296
Norm was trying to explain information from a conversation that he had with

1511
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:56,064
The other lawyers

1512
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:58,880
And Alex could not understand it

1513
01:36:59,136 --> 01:37:00,160
So Norm said

1514
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:01,696
Well basically

1515
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:08,096
What they're saying is he's like the mafia and they're going to end Alex took that to me know you're saying that he

1516
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:13,728
He said he's the mafia that's interesting I swear to you in my brain I can

1517
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:18,336
Feel it happening jump off your scenario

1518
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:22,944
Suggest another possible scenario same setup basically

1519
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:29,344
But Norm is trying to explain away to Alex why they're going to lose this case

1520
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:35,744
Because we're 100% done this all wrong

1521
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:42,144
From Barnes but I am a great lawyer but we're up against the mafia Alex

1522
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:48,544
Could be an explanation I don't know whatever it is it's something weird and Norm is likely to

1523
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:54,944
Really jumping up to be like shut this down shut this down

1524
01:37:57,504 --> 01:38:03,648
So we jump now to the Boston bombing because that happens little bit after the same

1525
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:09,280
I hook shooting right and what do you know Alex called that fake the day of also

1526
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:10,816
In April of two

1527
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:12,608
4 months

1528
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:13,632
After

1529
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:15,424
The tragedy is

1530
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:16,192
Sandy Hook

1531
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:21,056
The Boston

1532
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:23,104
Yes

1533
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:24,128
And

1534
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:25,920
You went on the air that night right

1535
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:27,712
Yes

1536
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:29,504
And

1537
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:31,040
He claimed that the Boston Marathon

1538
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:34,368
I said it

1539
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:36,416
Look like

1540
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:41,280
Yes was a lot of wood on Ali's lot of

1541
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:43,840
And you knew that

1542
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:48,960
Right we we we we talked to we had silver crew headband

1543
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:50,240
It was there

1544
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:57,664
Attribute

1545
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:06,368
And look, he's robbed his brother or brother-in-law was there

1546
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:12,768
And then they created a conspiracy out of how he didn't want to talk to them

1547
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:19,168
I don't want to be on leave me the f*** alone

1548
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:24,544
That this is now making up with exactly said but I would imagine it was

1549
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:30,944
This is insulting forgot that it was Rob do

1550
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:37,344
Sing it made me realize going to rob buza uncle is a FBI agent who is at Newtown robkins brother-in-law is the boss

1551
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:43,744
Family members are all over the news stories

1552
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,560
You've got a cartoonishly large family

1553
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:49,376
Like I'd like you very many

1554
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:55,776
Is Nurse Joy in the Pokemon series like they're all exactly like him though they're just all my cousin

1555
01:39:56,032 --> 01:40:02,176
It is a conspiracy and everything

1556
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:08,576
We could bathe in on a long game to ruin Alex is like this all done

1557
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:13,440
Things to justify calling the bombing fake and so he does that by

1558
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:18,816
Pointing to a news article about how disrupted Terror plots

1559
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:22,144
A lot of them have FBI informants it

1560
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:26,240
Zayn Malik

1561
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:44,416
I got to look pretty handsome

1562
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:02,592
Oklahoma City

1563
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:06,176
Fast and Furious Allstate station Aurora

1564
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:23,328
Nnsy eroding

1565
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:24,096
It's comes to you for

1566
01:41:26,912 --> 01:41:28,448
The Comfort people that are going to

1567
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:34,848
Challenge the system and that and that they believe basically are on these tablets for payroll people build it tonight or Sunday

1568
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:37,408
And the truth that you gave them

1569
01:41:37,664 --> 01:41:39,456
On the day of the Boston Marathon bombing

1570
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:40,480
Was that

1571
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:41,760
The bombing itself

1572
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:43,040
Correct

1573
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:53,024
If it look

1574
01:41:57,376 --> 01:41:59,680
Can you tonight also get me that article

1575
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:02,240
That shows that the New York Times ran

1576
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:05,568
That 95%

1577
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:07,360
I'm sorry that according to your time

1578
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:09,408
95% of terrorist Acts

1579
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:13,248
Are actually committed by the FBI

1580
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:17,088
Sure

1581
01:42:17,344 --> 01:42:20,160
So we're going back to the Boston Marathon bombing

1582
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:24,512
The truth that they came to you for on the day of the bombing

1583
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:25,792
Was

1584
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:26,816
Your claim

1585
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:27,840
That it was staged

1586
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:28,608
Correct

1587
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:31,680
That's what you said right

1588
01:42:32,192 --> 01:42:33,984
To The Forum, what happened

1589
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:39,360
Is everybody for looking at it and we're coming out

1590
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:41,152
Happening

1591
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:42,432
And we do that

1592
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:44,480
Islamic Terror plots

1593
01:42:44,736 --> 01:42:47,040
Provocateur and then staged

1594
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:48,320
Body up bi

1595
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:50,880
That list would probably not another one of those

1596
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:52,672
And that's what you told him

1597
01:42:55,488 --> 01:43:01,632
Assumption that it's an Islamic Terror plot is weird because I don't think that was even necessarily

1598
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:05,728
Something that was being discussed at certain but of course if you listen to the clip italics

1599
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:08,288
I had its beginning of this

1600
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:14,176
Saying that domestic Terror doesn't even really so that wasn't a possibility really

1601
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:22,112
Yeah I think that it's it's a fun defense Sprite 2.2

1602
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:28,512
Then there are articles that have discussed the dynamic of

1603
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:36,448
Asians into

1604
01:43:36,704 --> 01:43:41,056
The FBI being a little overzealous and trying to encourage

1605
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:43,360
People to carry through

1606
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:48,224
I would attach to the point where they could be arrested if I

1607
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:54,624
Do spending all of this time yeah yeah but it still doesn't really help Alex's argument as much as he thinks it does

1608
01:43:56,416 --> 01:44:01,280
And it doesn't stop them from just still thinking that

1609
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:03,328
The Tsarnaev brothers were patsies

1610
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:05,888
I said it I said

1611
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:07,936
It could be real

1612
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:12,800
We decide

1613
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:14,336
Could be Muslim

1614
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:15,360
Or homegrown Terror

1615
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:16,896
Right

1616
01:44:17,152 --> 01:44:17,920
Okay

1617
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:19,968
Which means

1618
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:22,272
You tell your Auntie Susan 95% chance

1619
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:23,296
That it's

1620
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:25,856
Stage by the government right

1621
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:27,648
And then you go on

1622
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:30,208
Even though I said there's a 5% chance

1623
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:32,256
You know I've never seen the Easter Bunny

1624
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:35,328
Domestic terrorism

1625
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:42,752
Almost all of it is is beautiful totally dead provocateur

1626
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:44,288
That the two

1627
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:47,104
Definitely

1628
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:48,896
Right

1629
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:51,456
And that's true even the one of them

1630
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:53,248
Murdered an MIT police off

1631
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:54,272
Correct

1632
01:44:54,784 --> 01:44:55,808
Okay

1633
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:58,112
And it's true even

1634
01:44:58,368 --> 01:44:58,880
Admitted

1635
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:00,672
He was involved in the

1636
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:08,096
Second what

1637
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:11,424
You know that

1638
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:14,240
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev

1639
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:16,288
It's not yet.

1640
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:21,408
Cuz I mean you just testified under oath that both of them working

1641
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:25,760
Underoath steaks I got to remember that

1642
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:29,600
Alright

1643
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:36,768
We can make mistakes baby here's what happened to hear Alex is narrative at the time because

1644
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:41,376
Cuz when johar was found here

1645
01:45:41,632 --> 01:45:47,776
And it always never going to be able to talk again it's perfect you know that was the

1646
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:50,848
The Narrative of the time they killed the one in Silence the other

1647
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:56,480
Alex is just kind of Forgotten basically that Joe Hart still alive

1648
01:45:56,736 --> 01:46:02,880
And so he's just turned it into they're both dad and his mind cuz he doesn't give a f***

1649
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:06,976
Beginning doesn't care now

1650
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,792
Night of the bombing

1651
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:12,096
Was a big night for Infowars

1652
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:16,960
According to Chris Maddie everybody except for Alex he's confused about it

1653
01:46:17,472 --> 01:46:20,800
The Boston Marathon bombing was actually a very big night for him

1654
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:21,824
Sports Direct

1655
01:46:22,848 --> 01:46:23,360
Jackson

1656
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,920
I don't remember

1657
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:31,552
You were going

1658
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:33,600
What happened

1659
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:35,392
Do you not

1660
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:39,488
Remember why that was a big night for Infowars

1661
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:44,352
Who is damodar

1662
01:46:46,144 --> 01:46:47,168
He's a

1663
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:50,496
Live around here

1664
01:46:52,032 --> 01:46:54,592
Professional wrestler and

1665
01:46:56,128 --> 01:46:56,640
Talk show host

1666
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:01,248
In a former employee of yours

1667
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:04,320
Workforce for about 6 months ago

1668
01:47:05,088 --> 01:47:05,600
And then

1669
01:47:06,624 --> 01:47:07,392
With a contract

1670
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:08,160
Reporter for you

1671
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:08,928
For years the RAF

1672
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:09,696
Are correct

1673
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:14,304
Some Eminem and Nei that he kept saying that he worked to us when he wasn't

1674
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:17,888
Order

1675
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:19,424
I would have dialysis

1676
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:26,080
Invader press conference on the night of the Boston bombing but there's a reason Alex is confused

1677
01:47:26,336 --> 01:47:27,872
News about Maddie asking about that

1678
01:47:28,384 --> 01:47:34,528
He's probably forgotten about that one since batondy did a way more offensive disruption to the press conference on April 8th

1679
01:47:34,784 --> 01:47:38,624
Teeth which gleefully broadcast alive

1680
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:43,488
Here's a clip of Alex's excitement just before that press conference started

1681
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:47,328
Being fully aware that he was going to yell promotional shape for Alex

1682
01:47:47,584 --> 01:47:48,352
At the expense

1683
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:49,632
Ava terrorized City

1684
01:47:50,144 --> 01:47:55,776
We will provide you with information as it becomes available

1685
01:48:11,392 --> 01:48:15,232
Galaxy very excited

1686
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:17,536
Giving you a live coverage on that

1687
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:21,888
He's so excited he's breaking into him takari and David night or hosting

1688
01:48:22,144 --> 01:48:28,288
It's be like already disrupted the first press conference

1689
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:31,104
There's already a precedent for this and I'm going to do

1690
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:33,664
He's going to go he's going to push it even further

1691
01:48:34,176 --> 01:48:35,200
Super Clock man

1692
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:38,784
Alex didn't remember that because you get so much brass

1693
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:41,088
It's no big deal for him

1694
01:48:42,112 --> 01:48:44,672
On the night of the Boston Marathon bombing the reason that it

1695
01:48:46,464 --> 01:48:46,976
Because

1696
01:48:47,488 --> 01:48:48,512
Mister batondy ass

1697
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:50,304
The question at a nationally televised

1698
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:52,864
Nationally televised presidential

1699
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:56,192
Okay I thought it was days later

1700
01:49:00,288 --> 01:49:01,056
I remember

1701
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:04,640
I'm liking this request

1702
01:49:05,408 --> 01:49:06,176
I don't know

1703
01:49:08,992 --> 01:49:10,016
You know what I'm talkin about

1704
01:49:10,528 --> 01:49:14,880
That was a big deal

1705
01:49:15,136 --> 01:49:18,208
Are you only remember something happened on that you do with the way the press conference

1706
01:49:19,488 --> 01:49:23,584
I understand for you guys like being the media wants a big deal or whatever those might

1707
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:31,776
We can break

1708
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:32,544
41

1709
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,080
And if you want to

1710
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:35,872
His lunch order now red

1711
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:42,528
Sure they get some steak I think

1712
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:46,112
Time is of the essence

1713
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:52,512
I understand that you got to have the food delivered

1714
01:49:52,768 --> 01:49:57,120
Come back from getting the food order and look it's not a big

1715
01:49:57,376 --> 01:50:02,752
Deal that Dan batondy interrupted this press conference Alex gets press all the time man

1716
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:04,032
Do you recall

1717
01:50:04,544 --> 01:50:05,312
That mister

1718
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:06,848
Vedonde

1719
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:08,640
Asked

1720
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:10,432
Question at a national

1721
01:50:10,688 --> 01:50:11,456
Televised press,

1722
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:14,784
Yes I do and that was a big deal

1723
01:50:15,552 --> 01:50:16,064
Portrayed

1724
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:21,952
We have a lot of big deals but yeah that was it was it was definitely interesting from this was 2013

1725
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:24,512
So this was 9 years ago

1726
01:50:24,768 --> 01:50:25,280
Right

1727
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:27,072
Correct

1728
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:30,912
Infowars to get that kind of national exposure at that time

1729
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:31,680
With a big deal

1730
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:39,104
Know if you want to know technically going on with George Noory on Coast to Coast AM he saw the right. It's the back then it was at least

1731
01:50:41,408 --> 01:50:43,200
This is your auntie inspector

1732
01:50:44,736 --> 01:50:46,528
Going on other people's big shows

1733
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:52,160
Talk radio even though the media ignores it you are a guest on somebody else's show and that was a big deal

1734
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:56,512
And I would say him y'all that out of that press conference

1735
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:00,608
It was you know where you know

1736
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:02,144
Good job

1737
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:06,752
But basically the question that's not that big a deal

1738
01:51:07,008 --> 01:51:13,152
Here are a couple of clips from the 18th of Alex

1739
01:51:13,408 --> 01:51:19,552
Not that big a deal

1740
01:51:28,256 --> 01:51:30,560
We broke the record

1741
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:35,168
Centrism

1742
01:51:35,424 --> 01:51:36,960
Oh man doubled the traffic

1743
01:51:37,216 --> 01:51:43,360
If ever gotten

1744
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:46,432
Ever because

1745
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:47,712
No certainly.

1746
01:51:48,224 --> 01:51:54,368
We are about

1747
01:52:08,448 --> 01:52:13,056
Oh my God

1748
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:15,872
Just during this window

1749
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:19,456
It is 100

1750
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:35,072
Yeah so he doesn't play those clips for him but it was a big deal

1751
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:44,032
The coast to coast that the real people he was so excited about the idea of his name

1752
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:47,616
Infowars being broadcast on a platform that wasn't

1753
01:52:48,128 --> 01:52:52,736
It mcneish weirdo world it is very much like

1754
01:52:54,528 --> 01:52:55,296
I mean

1755
01:52:55,808 --> 01:53:01,952
This is this is kind of the way that Colonel Travis would want it to go you know like he got drunk and celebrated every

1756
01:53:02,208 --> 01:53:05,792
Free tiny Victory along the way and now he's about to be over

1757
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:10,144
Come by the entirety of a f****** Nation thank God

1758
01:53:10,656 --> 01:53:16,800
So we know that Infowars with the quickest path to getting hired there is to yell at

Correct

1778
01:54:03,136 --> 01:54:04,928
At some point

1779
01:54:05,184 --> 01:54:06,208
Early

1780
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:08,000
2000m

1781
01:54:08,256 --> 01:54:09,280
Thirteen or thereabouts

1782
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:10,816
Alexa come back up

1783
01:54:11,072 --> 01:54:11,584
Turo

1784
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:12,352
Correct

1785
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:13,376
Yes because

1786
01:54:13,632 --> 01:54:14,400
He had left his

1787
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:15,424
White diamond

1788
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:16,448
Scolipede

1789
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:24,384
I let him go is reason left

1790
01:54:25,152 --> 01:54:25,664
OU fire

1791
01:54:28,736 --> 01:54:29,504
Suicide

1792
01:54:33,344 --> 01:54:36,160
Developing into a Howard Stern deal

1793
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:42,304
You know

1794
01:54:46,144 --> 01:54:47,168
It's just that I

1795
01:54:48,192 --> 01:54:50,752
I wasn't looking for Howard Stern type character

1796
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:54,592
And that's what was turning into

1797
01:54:56,896 --> 01:55:00,224
Longer was actually on the payroll working right now

1798
01:55:00,736 --> 01:55:02,016
But despite

1799
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:04,320
The fact that he was

1800
01:55:05,088 --> 01:55:06,624
Somebody you fired

1801
01:55:07,392 --> 01:55:12,256
How would you describe the reason you fired him because he just we wasn't doing the stories that you told him to do

1802
01:55:12,512 --> 01:55:14,304
And it was his overall demeanor

1803
01:55:14,816 --> 01:55:16,096
He was he was he was going

1804
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:20,704
I told him we were sending one reporter to the Jenna 21 conference

1805
01:55:21,472 --> 01:55:24,800
I said don't go to anyone to it

1806
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:28,640
Yes

1807
01:55:28,896 --> 01:55:29,408
Is there any other reason

1808
01:55:30,688 --> 01:55:31,712
Just wasn't taking Direction

1809
01:55:39,136 --> 01:55:45,280
Wow Siri was getting into a kind of thing

1810
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:48,352
You know he was he was around

1811
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:52,960
You did the Boston bombing stuff and then I kind of going to have

1812
01:55:53,216 --> 01:55:58,336
Yeah it wasn't really working out anymore we had a connection with him I don't really even know his name

1813
01:55:58,592 --> 01:56:00,896
Man if bongino listens to this

1814
01:56:01,152 --> 01:56:07,296
This is the first time he's going to find out what Alex really feels about him cuz then we remember.

1815
01:56:13,952 --> 01:56:18,560
Them for it sure if they weren't bad I wouldn't need to know either name

1816
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:23,424
But it is he seems to eat loves Alex Rim his in his

1817
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:29,824
Deposition he was like Alex and I are great friends Alex is so nice to me I like working with them

1818
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:36,224
We haven't heard the batondy deposition yet

1819
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:42,624
Well the deposition is from

1820
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:49,024
Connecticut earn more about what

1821
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:55,424
Okay subject framing of the

1822
01:56:55,680 --> 01:57:01,312
Firing of badonde tiles up at

1823
01:57:01,568 --> 01:57:03,104
But it's a nice first effort

1824
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:07,456
Opening Gambit

1825
01:57:07,712 --> 01:57:13,856
So throughout this and there's a couple points where Norm tries to go off the Record really fast cuz he wants to make like a joke

1826
01:57:14,112 --> 01:57:15,648
Joker tell a little story

1827
01:57:15,904 --> 01:57:18,720
And I got some of them aren't worth

1828
01:57:18,976 --> 01:57:25,120
Mentioning it's all I think we're actually caught and we're off the Record

1829
01:57:25,376 --> 01:57:27,168
But this was recorded and it's

1830
01:57:27,424 --> 01:57:28,704
F****** nuts

1831
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:31,520
Naked teens

1832
01:57:32,544 --> 01:57:33,312
I just have

1833
01:57:34,592 --> 01:57:36,128
Joe Carter

1834
01:57:43,296 --> 01:57:44,832
So this takes me back a long way

1835
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:48,672
Stunning turn of events in New York

1836
01:57:52,768 --> 01:57:56,608
Yasso johar Tsarnaev took a Norms nice to prom

1837
01:57:56,864 --> 01:57:58,400
Junior prom

1838
01:57:58,656 --> 01:57:59,680
There's no

1839
01:57:59,936 --> 01:58:02,496
There's Five Guys there's five guys on this way

1840
01:58:02,752 --> 01:58:08,896
This is absurd what the fuk just happened what did I just hear

1841
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:16,064
Alright every any any small small world story is now gone

1842
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:20,160
Northeast

1843
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:27,584
Dand so Alex believes that the traffic Spike that he saw

1844
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:31,680
Right nothing to do the unrelated completely unrelated

1845
01:58:32,192 --> 01:58:32,704
Your

1846
01:58:33,472 --> 01:58:34,496
Monthly users

1847
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:37,312
Went from 5.5 million in March

1848
01:58:37,568 --> 01:58:38,336
211 point

1849
01:58:38,592 --> 01:58:39,104
6 million

1850
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:39,872
In April

1851
01:58:40,128 --> 01:58:43,456
Correct people TuneIn

1852
01:58:43,968 --> 01:58:50,112
To my show when there's big eventually that way more listeners

1853
01:58:50,368 --> 01:58:52,928
Well one of the reasons why on your website

1854
01:58:53,184 --> 01:58:54,208
In April's because

1855
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:57,280
You got damn daddy yelling about enforcer Prescott

1856
01:58:58,304 --> 01:58:58,816
Directions

1857
01:59:02,656 --> 01:59:05,472
But it is getting traffic and successful bad

1858
01:59:06,496 --> 01:59:07,520
Number for dogs

1859
01:59:08,288 --> 01:59:08,800
Not bad

1860
01:59:10,336 --> 01:59:10,848
So

1861
01:59:11,104 --> 01:59:17,248
We just heard him say that the traffic was 50 times what it ever was

1862
01:59:17,504 --> 01:59:21,600
Immediately after she interrupted the press conference so

1863
01:59:21,856 --> 01:59:23,904
I think I can go f*** himself with that nonsense

1864
01:59:24,416 --> 01:59:26,464
So the question becomes

1865
01:59:27,488 --> 01:59:29,536
Batondy wants to Sandy Hook

1866
01:59:29,792 --> 01:59:31,328
A couple times

1867
01:59:31,584 --> 01:59:33,888
In 2014 and in 2015

1868
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:34,912
Alex

1869
01:59:35,168 --> 01:59:35,936
You sent him

1870
01:59:37,984 --> 01:59:39,264
Tries to be slippery

1871
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:41,568
And if it's unsuccessful

1872
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:43,360
Youth Orchestra.

1873
01:59:43,872 --> 01:59:44,384
Sandy Hook

1874
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:45,408
2014 correct

1875
01:59:50,272 --> 01:59:53,856
I mean I mean I definitely was he was going there and I think I was

1876
01:59:54,624 --> 01:59:55,392
Do you understand my question

1877
01:59:57,184 --> 01:59:58,976
I'm asking you did you send him

1878
01:59:59,232 --> 02:00:01,280
Yes or no in 2014

1879
02:00:04,608 --> 02:00:05,632
I was going there

1880
02:00:06,144 --> 02:00:12,288
So I'm going to ask my question again

1881
02:00:19,712 --> 02:00:21,504
You sent him to Sandy Hook in 24

1882
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:22,528
Digimon

1883
02:00:25,856 --> 02:00:27,392
I don't remember fair enough

1884
02:00:30,976 --> 02:00:34,304
That the lasting he covered for Infowars was the Boston Bomber

1885
02:00:34,816 --> 02:00:36,864
That's what you testify Jordan

1886
02:00:39,168 --> 02:00:40,960
Even get that wrong

1887
02:00:41,216 --> 02:00:44,544
You lied about that

1888
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:46,080
Is because

1889
02:00:46,336 --> 02:00:47,104
You knew

1890
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:51,712
She covered Sandy Hook for you and you knew that was a problem for you

1891
02:00:51,968 --> 02:00:55,808
No I just told you that for us

1892
02:00:56,064 --> 02:00:56,832
Mr. Jones

1893
02:00:57,600 --> 02:01:01,184
When you testified in March 2019 you didn't know what I know now

1894
02:01:01,696 --> 02:01:02,464
Uh-oh

1895
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:05,536
I don't want to hear that

1896
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:08,096
Especially not from a lawyer know

1897
02:01:08,352 --> 02:01:11,680
What do you know

1898
02:01:12,192 --> 02:01:12,960
Do you know now

1899
02:01:16,288 --> 02:01:19,616
14/25

1900
02:01:19,872 --> 02:01:22,944
Are you going tonight

1901
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:38,304
Saying that I didn't want to do stuff for us. Remember the times I've Jackson he's being cut off

1902
02:01:39,072 --> 02:01:41,376
To cover Trump rallies in 2016

1903
02:01:43,168 --> 02:01:43,936
You deny it

1904
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:48,800
I believe that's what I was getting at about

1905
02:01:49,056 --> 02:01:49,568
The pain

1906
02:01:49,824 --> 02:01:51,360
Because as soon as you were sued

1907
02:01:51,616 --> 02:01:54,688
You instructed your staff to go and figure out when was the last time you paid.

1908
02:01:54,944 --> 02:01:55,456
Did you not

1909
02:01:55,712 --> 02:01:56,224
Objection

1910
02:01:56,736 --> 02:02:00,576
Because you would think you were asking how long you work there and I had to figure that out

1911
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:04,160
Real that's what you guys want

1912
02:02:04,672 --> 02:02:05,952
Impending

1913
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:12,864
Shut up shut up

1914
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:19,264
If the only experienced that you have with the American legal system is through this show

1915
02:02:19,776 --> 02:02:25,920
How could you not think that every law situation isn't like who ordered the code red like this is

1916
02:02:28,224 --> 02:02:34,368
It is

1917
02:02:34,624 --> 02:02:40,768
But like me have to make the hard decisions

1918
02:02:41,024 --> 02:02:47,168
I don't remember I'm in the media all the time these are something blow me like

1919
02:02:47,424 --> 02:02:53,568
What are we doing man yeah this is insane yeah it is

1920
02:02:53,824 --> 02:02:59,968
I think a fair assumption would be that he asked about the payroll with it on because he wanted

1921
02:03:00,224 --> 02:03:05,088
You know what the paper trail was

1922
02:03:05,344 --> 02:03:11,232
Not according to Alex.

1923
02:03:11,744 --> 02:03:12,512
What did you last talk to me

1924
02:03:19,936 --> 02:03:20,704
Years ago

1925
02:03:26,336 --> 02:03:27,360
Like how many years

1926
02:03:30,432 --> 02:03:31,968
Remember it's been years

1927
02:03:32,736 --> 02:03:34,272
3 years 4 years on a

1928
02:03:35,552 --> 02:03:37,344
Did you call him after your deposition and text

1929
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:39,904
I don't believe so no

1930
02:03:43,744 --> 02:03:45,024
You can speak to mister batondy

1931
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:46,816
On the telephone after you were deposed

1932
02:03:47,072 --> 02:03:47,584
Texas

1933
02:03:48,096 --> 02:03:49,120
In the presence of a lawyer

1934
02:03:50,912 --> 02:03:51,680
I do not

1935
02:03:51,936 --> 02:03:52,704
Melissa no

1936
02:03:53,472 --> 02:03:54,752
You did not call mr.

1937
02:03:55,008 --> 02:04:00,384
Padatti do apologize for the way that you miss characterize your relationship with him when you testified in Texas

1938
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:04,992
Do not remember doing that you didn't offer to having down to Texas

1939
02:04:05,248 --> 02:04:07,552

Publicly

02:04:42,368 --> 02:04:44,672
Getting reports of your deposition in the press and

And

1956
02:04:53,632 --> 02:04:57,984
You're getting these questions and they're fairly specific like an invitation to dinner and some like that

1957
02:04:58,240 --> 02:05:00,800
Can I got to assume that this is coming from Baton d

1958
02:05:01,056 --> 02:05:07,200
If you want to get wildly paranoid they have your phone calls

Recorded they were spying on you or something five eyes was watching

Tamper with our Witnesses you remember that buddy do you remember how the presence of a lawyer

1961
02:05:20,256 --> 02:05:26,400
Some weird fantasy where you can go meet him in the middle of a parking garage and witnessed an

1962
02:05:26,656 --> 02:05:27,168
A

1963
02:05:27,424 --> 02:05:29,728

80%

2005
02:07:49,248 --> 02:07:50,272
Oh my God

2006
02:07:50,784 --> 02:07:51,552
You guys have that

2007
02:07:53,344 --> 02:07:53,856
You don't know that

2008
02:07:54,112 --> 02:07:55,904
Do you put on screen pouring its

2009
02:07:56,160 --> 02:07:58,976
Unfathomable that someone to be oblivious of this

2010
02:07:59,232 --> 02:08:01,280
Like it's just with you

2011
02:08:01,536 --> 02:08:07,680
Strains credulity to imagine negotiating tactic all right how much do you think I own I'm going to throw

2012
02:08:07,936 --> 02:08:10,496
Zero to start now what are you going to come back with

2013
02:08:10,752 --> 02:08:16,896
100 alright I wasn't 1% maybe inasmuch as

2014
02:08:17,152 --> 02:08:23,296
Like he doesn't have ownership

2015
02:08:23,552 --> 02:08:25,600
Properties that he owns it on them

2016
02:08:25,856 --> 02:08:27,392
Cool

2017
02:08:27,648 --> 02:08:33,792
So let me tell you something

2018
02:08:34,048 --> 02:08:37,376
The real shrewd businessman I can't get a dime out of that guy

2019
02:08:37,632 --> 02:08:39,680
He is running me wild

2020
02:08:39,936 --> 02:08:46,080
So investigation was released at a certain point

2021
02:08:46,336 --> 02:08:48,384
Answers to the

2022
02:08:48,896 --> 02:08:55,040
Alleged anomalies that Alex is so concerned about some of those

2023
02:08:55,296 --> 02:09:00,160
The question becomes when did you really

2024
02:09:00,672 --> 02:09:03,488
Did you read that and Alex

2025
02:09:03,744 --> 02:09:06,304
Obfuscating gear for no reason

2026
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:08,096
At the end

2027
02:09:08,352 --> 02:09:09,120
2030

2028
02:09:11,936 --> 02:09:12,704
You are aware that

2029
02:09:14,496 --> 02:09:15,264
Connecticut state

2030
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:16,032
Attorney

2031
02:09:17,568 --> 02:09:18,080
Issued his

2032
02:09:18,336 --> 02:09:18,848
Rapport

2033
02:09:19,616 --> 02:09:20,640
Concerning his investigation

2034
02:09:21,664 --> 02:09:22,432
What year was that

2035
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:23,712
2013

2036
02:09:27,808 --> 02:09:28,832
There was a report

2037
02:09:29,344 --> 02:09:31,392
That was released in November

2038
02:09:31,648 --> 02:09:32,672
13 you remember that

2039
02:09:33,696 --> 02:09:35,488
Yes and then there were supplemental

2040
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,792
Reports that were released in December

2041
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:39,328
Correct yes

2042
02:09:39,584 --> 02:09:41,120
And did you read both reports

2043
02:09:42,656 --> 02:09:43,424
Amarillo Canal room

2044
02:09:44,192 --> 02:09:45,728
You do how do you pad your payment

2045
02:09:48,032 --> 02:09:48,544
I don't

2046
02:09:49,056 --> 02:09:50,336
This all gets foggy

2047
02:09:50,592 --> 02:09:56,480
Later they were for what they weren't really don't remember remember some big big big part of the hubbub was

2048
02:09:56,736 --> 02:10:01,600
Philosophy wasn't being released the public wanted and they weren't releasing do you know I just asked you a question

2049
02:10:02,624 --> 02:10:03,136
So

2050
02:10:03,392 --> 02:10:05,184
In response to that question you've already testify

2051
02:10:05,952 --> 02:10:06,720
That you review both

2052
02:10:06,976 --> 02:10:07,744
Reports that were issued in

2053
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:08,512
2013

2054
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:09,792
And now I'm asking

2055
02:10:10,304 --> 02:10:10,816
How did Utah

2056
02:10:11,328 --> 02:10:15,424
I don't remember how I obtain another remember when I reviewed the last breath

2057
02:10:15,936 --> 02:10:17,216
Well you would have reviewed them right then

2058
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:18,752
I mean

2059
02:10:19,264 --> 02:10:21,568
Review the right whenever came out whenever

2060
02:10:22,336 --> 02:10:24,128
Okay but that's something that obviously you would have done

2061
02:10:24,384 --> 02:10:25,152
Given your

2062
02:10:25,408 --> 02:10:25,920
Clean that

2063
02:10:26,176 --> 02:10:26,688
It was a hoax

2064
02:10:27,968 --> 02:10:30,016
Like I said I don't remember

2065
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:31,808
Are we lost

2066
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:33,856
Yeah but I read a lot of stuff

2067
02:10:34,368 --> 02:10:35,648
There was only one shooting in

2068
02:10:35,904 --> 02:10:37,184
In 2012.

2069
02:10:37,696 --> 02:10:38,464
Clean the light to 20

2070
02:10:38,976 --> 02:10:39,488
People

2071
02:10:40,768 --> 02:10:42,048
That you would call The hoax

2072
02:10:42,816 --> 02:10:46,144
So wouldn't you have wanted to see the report of the State's Attorney's

2073
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:46,912
The office when it was

2074
02:10:47,936 --> 02:10:48,448
2

2075
02:10:49,728 --> 02:10:51,776
Investigate your claim

2076
02:10:54,592 --> 02:10:56,128
Exactly how

2077
02:10:56,384 --> 02:10:57,920
Okay but wouldn't it have been your practice

2078
02:10:58,176 --> 02:10:58,688
Just Wynn

2079
02:10:58,944 --> 02:10:59,712
Unofficial report Lake

2080
02:11:00,224 --> 02:11:01,504
Came out on an event that you

2081
02:11:02,784 --> 02:11:03,552
Books to read it as soon as

2082
02:11:06,624 --> 02:11:08,672
Wewewewe doesn't try to do stuff like that

2083
02:11:09,184 --> 02:11:10,208
I miss you but you wow

2084
02:11:11,232 --> 02:11:13,792
Don't you person is being honest I don't remember when

2085
02:11:14,048 --> 02:11:20,192
Okay so this is so easy for Alex and he could have gotten out of this yes I read it

2086
02:11:20,448 --> 02:11:23,008
I don't care I don't trust official delegation

2087
02:11:23,264 --> 02:11:29,408
That's the point yeah I've never believed any of these things why would I it's my standing policy that the media is

2088
02:11:29,664 --> 02:11:35,296
Full of liars the government is full of liars and his investigation recovering s*** up

2089
02:11:35,552 --> 02:11:37,856
So I have a stated

2090
02:11:38,112 --> 02:11:41,696
Like primary position a default position of distrust

2091
02:11:41,952 --> 02:11:48,096
And I read it as casual reading it's a fiction novel it's a Dean Koontz novel

2092
02:11:48,352 --> 02:11:49,376
Show me to read at the beach

2093
02:11:49,632 --> 02:11:55,776
I don't believe this s*** is it is weird because it is so quick it's like listen to the reason we are here

2094
02:11:56,032 --> 02:12:02,176
Your right now is because I don't believe anything the government says are you asking me if I believed anything the

2095
02:12:02,432 --> 02:12:03,456
Government Center

2096
02:12:03,712 --> 02:12:09,856
It's it's a metallic seems to be trying to evade the question is if the answer I don't believe the invest

2097
02:12:10,112 --> 02:12:16,256
Navigation is sort of

2098
02:12:16,512 --> 02:12:22,656
Cuz then it looks like oh so you did know cuz you read the investigation and now you're not telling me about

2099
02:12:22,912 --> 02:12:25,728
About it because you don't want me to know that you did know

2100
02:12:25,984 --> 02:12:29,312
So these subjective Wolfgang halbig begins to come up

2101
02:12:29,568 --> 02:12:35,712
And Alex has asked about his credentials and of course we have to conclude that

2102
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:39,296
Pretty much all of it just came from both gag

2103
02:12:39,552 --> 02:12:45,696
Dang saying I got all these credentials it was a suspiciously long list of credentials for what

2104
02:12:45,952 --> 02:12:52,096
One man to have said that he has tenure with the state trooper

2105
02:12:52,352 --> 02:12:53,888
Organization

2106
02:12:54,144 --> 02:12:57,728
I am to Alex eventually learned this was not the case so nobody

2107
02:12:57,984 --> 02:13:00,800
Really answer how he learned

2108
02:13:01,056 --> 02:13:03,360
Bad idea answer you stated their that

2109
02:13:03,616 --> 02:13:06,176
Mister how they had a long career as a state police officer

2110
02:13:06,432 --> 02:13:07,712
Correct

2111
02:13:10,528 --> 02:13:11,296
How did you learn that was

2112
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:14,368
I just really wanted his help me God

2113
02:13:15,392 --> 02:13:16,672
Wasn't this a place that long

2114
02:13:20,256 --> 02:13:21,024
Just

2115
02:13:22,816 --> 02:13:24,864
I don't remember everybody.

2116
02:13:25,888 --> 02:13:26,400
Call Watson

2117
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:28,192
Meetings are

2118
02:13:28,448 --> 02:13:28,960
Agreeing

2119

What we thought

2120
02:13:30,496 --> 02:13:33,056
Watson was a few of the people didn't call today remember

2121
02:13:34,848 --> 02:13:35,616
Saying hey

2122
02:13:36,640 --> 02:13:39,200
Really got into it

2123
02:13:39,456 --> 02:13:40,480
Bellator

2124
02:13:41,504 --> 02:13:42,016
Jim Fetzer

2125
02:13:47,392 --> 02:13:49,184
I'm saying is that I

2126
02:13:51,232 --> 02:13:51,744
When

2127
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:53,536
Happened when

2128
02:13:54,048 --> 02:13:55,840
People bring it up and I'll play Devil's Advocate

2129
02:14:01,216 --> 02:14:01,728
Not talk

2130
02:14:02,496 --> 02:14:03,264
Miss Jones

2131
02:14:04,288 --> 02:14:05,056
Move to strike

2132
02:14:05,568 --> 02:14:06,080
My

2133
02:14:06,336 --> 02:14:07,104
Question was

2134
02:14:07,872 --> 02:14:08,640
My question was

2135
02:14:09,408 --> 02:14:10,176
Who told you

2136
02:14:10,944 --> 02:14:12,736
That Mr how we had not had a long

2137
02:14:16,064 --> 02:14:16,576
Thank you

2138
02:14:16,832 --> 02:14:18,112
I have no idea

2139
02:14:18,368 --> 02:14:24,512
Dies I just I probably knew from the job of course you did

2140
02:14:24,768 --> 02:14:27,840
Read his credentials UE you're either that stupid or you're not

2141
02:14:28,352 --> 02:14:33,728
Choose Alex can't really argue as way out of saying that Robbie Parker was an actor

2142
02:14:33,984 --> 02:14:39,104
But there's there's something that he keeps saying and there's clips of him saying this

2143
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:42,176
That multiple people were actors

2144
02:14:42,432 --> 02:14:48,064
Alex really has a difficult time explaining why he said that

2145
02:14:48,320 --> 02:14:52,672
You got people clearly coming up in a laughing and then doing the fake crying

2146
02:14:52,928 --> 02:14:58,304
You clearly got people where is actors playing different parts of different people

2147
02:14:59,072 --> 02:15:00,608
Say we clearly got people

2148
02:15:00,864 --> 02:15:01,632
Who are actors

2149
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:03,680
Coming up and playing the parts at

2150
02:15:04,448 --> 02:15:04,960
Right

2151
02:15:05,984 --> 02:15:08,032
So you got multiple actors you're telling your aunt

2152
02:15:08,288 --> 02:15:08,800
Audience right

2153
02:15:11,616 --> 02:15:12,896
I just told you that

2154
02:15:16,992 --> 02:15:17,504
What's going on

2155
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:18,272
Okay mr. Jones

2156
02:15:19,040 --> 02:15:20,064
You just saw yourself

2157
02:15:21,088 --> 02:15:21,600
Say words in

2158
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:23,392
The words that you

2159
02:15:23,648 --> 02:15:24,160
You said were

2160
02:15:24,416 --> 02:15:24,928
We've got

2161
02:15:25,952 --> 02:15:26,720
We got

2162
02:15:26,976 --> 02:15:27,488
Actors

2163
02:15:27,744 --> 02:15:28,768
Playing the parts of different

2164
02:15:29,536 --> 02:15:30,048
Right

2165
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:31,328
That's what you said

2166
02:15:31,584 --> 02:15:32,096
Right

2167
02:15:33,120 --> 02:15:33,888
Who are the actor

2168
02:15:35,168 --> 02:15:36,960
That's what folks were talking about with the corner

2169
02:15:40,032 --> 02:15:41,824
Okay so here you referring to

2170
02:15:43,872 --> 02:15:44,640
The corner

2171
02:15:45,664 --> 02:15:46,432
An actor playing

2172
02:15:46,944 --> 02:15:48,736
Right or or something

2173
02:15:48,992 --> 02:15:49,504
Someone

2174
02:15:52,064 --> 02:15:53,088
Okay

2175
02:15:55,136 --> 02:15:55,648
Videos

2176
02:15:55,904 --> 02:15:56,672
The internet

2177
02:15:56,928 --> 02:15:57,696
You didn't just say

2178
02:15:59,232 --> 02:15:59,744
UK

2179
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:01,024
We've clearly got

2180
02:16:02,048 --> 02:16:02,560
Play

2181
02:16:03,072 --> 02:16:03,584
That's what you say

2182
02:16:04,864 --> 02:16:05,376
So

2183
02:16:06,144 --> 02:16:07,168
And now what you're telling

2184
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:09,728
Is that you are referring to

2185
02:16:10,496 --> 02:16:11,008
The corner

2186
02:16:12,288 --> 02:16:13,568
An actor was playing

2187
02:16:13,824 --> 02:16:14,592
That roll

2188
02:16:14,848 --> 02:16:15,616
And then another one

2189
02:16:15,872 --> 02:16:16,384
Right

2190
02:16:17,920 --> 02:16:19,456
Okay and who else

2191
02:16:21,248 --> 02:16:22,272
Okay so now you got

2192
02:16:22,528 --> 02:16:23,296
Robbie

2193
02:16:23,552 --> 02:16:24,320
Mister Parker

2194
02:16:24,832 --> 02:16:25,344
Is an actor

2195
02:16:25,856 --> 02:16:26,368
Play

2196
02:16:26,624 --> 02:16:27,136
Play Mister

2197
02:16:29,184 --> 02:16:29,696
She said

2198
02:16:33,536 --> 02:16:34,304
You're questioning

2199
02:16:34,560 --> 02:16:36,096
Clearly got it

2200
02:16:36,864 --> 02:16:37,888
Those were your words right

2201
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:42,240
So you got Robbie

2202
02:16:42,752 --> 02:16:44,800
You got an actor playing the corner

2203
02:16:45,056 --> 02:16:45,568
Right

2204
02:16:46,592 --> 02:16:47,360
That's what they do

2205
02:16:48,128 --> 02:16:49,152
That's what you said

2206
02:16:49,664 --> 02:16:50,688
I don't know why you're continuing

2207
02:16:51,200 --> 02:16:52,480
Did you see anybody else on that screen

2208
02:16:55,040 --> 02:17:01,184
Okay I can't understand what you're saying

2209
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:05,024
Understand that you're saying because it is too threatening to me

2210
02:17:06,304 --> 02:17:10,912
Yeah you know one of the things that I find interesting is how I'll attest a distance himself

2211
02:17:11,168 --> 02:17:12,704
Like from definitive

2212
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:17,312
Claims it anyway

2213
02:17:17,568 --> 02:17:23,712
Kind of had as a thesis for a long time that is the enemy of any of these people to specificity you don't want to be me

2214
02:17:23,968 --> 02:17:29,344
Nail down to anything so it's like is that what you said that's the internet said no you just said that

2215
02:17:30,368 --> 02:17:36,000
And the one of the problems with specificity is that as you pursue it

2216
02:17:36,768 --> 02:17:40,096
These theories start to really sound dumb

2217
02:17:40,864 --> 02:17:45,984
Because the implications of these people being actors

2218
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:52,128
Are clear like it's clearly not something that's well thought through by the people who promoted these theories right

2219
02:17:52,384 --> 02:17:57,248
And this is explored by Maddie in this next clip

2220
02:17:57,504 --> 02:17:58,528
About how like

2221
02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:04,672
How would this make sense that Robbie Parker isn't actor

2222
02:18:05,440 --> 02:18:11,584
If that then what else must be true us on Project Camelot like let's

2223
02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:17,984
Cheese this out and see how far these space aliens really go and essentially you know you get to a point where

2224
02:18:18,240 --> 02:18:23,360
Malatesta admit to basically everyone has to be in on it in order for this make any sense

2225
02:18:23,872 --> 02:18:25,664
It's important to understand how this can

2226
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:26,432
Spirits

2227
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:28,480
I'm in your mind okay

2228
02:18:30,784 --> 02:18:32,576
I'm asking operation Northwoods

2229
02:18:32,832 --> 02:18:35,904
Okay

2230
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:38,208
Instead the kids death blow up the airplane

2231
02:18:38,464 --> 02:18:39,744
How you doing all thank you

2232
02:18:40,512 --> 02:18:41,280
Well let's just talk

2233
02:18:41,536 --> 02:18:42,560
You just told me about

2234
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:44,608
What you think

2235
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:46,144
All right and what you work

2236
02:18:47,168 --> 02:18:49,472
To your earphone your claim

2237
02:18:50,496 --> 02:18:51,264
Your queen

2238
02:18:52,544 --> 02:18:53,056
You're playing

2239
02:18:54,848 --> 02:18:55,872
In response to my

2240
02:18:56,384 --> 02:18:56,896
That

2241
02:18:57,408 --> 02:18:58,688
There's a fictitious

2242
02:18:59,456 --> 02:19:00,480
Person named Robbie Parker

2243
02:19:00,992 --> 02:19:01,504
The actor play

2244
02:19:02,528 --> 02:19:03,296
You'd agree with me

2245
02:19:04,064 --> 02:19:07,904
That by going in front of the camera to Millions annoying to people

2246
02:19:08,160 --> 02:19:09,696
There will be somebody who would know hey

2247
02:19:10,976 --> 02:19:11,744
I know that guy

2248
02:19:15,328 --> 02:19:16,608
You just answered that

2249
02:19:16,864 --> 02:19:17,376
Question

2250
02:19:17,888 --> 02:19:19,936
You think that is that a reasonable expectation

2251
02:19:20,192 --> 02:19:21,472
No

2252
02:19:27,360 --> 02:19:27,872
If

2253
02:19:28,384 --> 02:19:28,896
Somebody

2254
02:19:29,152 --> 02:19:29,664
What a wrecking

2255
02:19:31,968 --> 02:19:32,736
Somebody would have

2256
02:19:32,992 --> 02:19:33,504
Recognize

2257
02:19:35,296 --> 02:19:36,576
The person playing Roddy Piper

2258
02:19:37,088 --> 02:19:37,600
Isn't it.

2259
02:19:39,136 --> 02:19:40,160
That would blow the whole

2260
02:19:40,928 --> 02:19:41,440
Pokes

2261
02:19:42,976 --> 02:19:44,768
You know the potemkin villages

2262
02:19:47,328 --> 02:19:48,608
Now there's a potemkin village

2263
02:19:50,912 --> 02:19:52,448
By potemkin Village you mean

2264
02:19:52,704 --> 02:19:53,728
Everybody

2265
02:19:53,984 --> 02:19:56,032
Who was in the immediate community

2266
02:19:56,544 --> 02:19:57,312
Would have been Anton

2267
02:20:01,664 --> 02:20:03,968
That's what you mean that everybody in the community

2268
02:20:04,224 --> 02:20:06,016
Nearby.

2269
02:20:06,528 --> 02:20:07,552
Which would mean

2270
02:20:08,064 --> 02:20:09,344
Certainly all the parents

2271
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:10,112
Of children

2272
02:20:13,184 --> 02:20:13,696
Text

2273
02:20:13,952 --> 02:20:14,976
Or maybe the new app

2274
02:20:16,256 --> 02:20:20,096
When you talk about actor

2275
02:20:25,472 --> 02:20:27,264
Clearly actors

2276
02:20:28,032 --> 02:20:31,104
Did you tell your own internet clip right now hey I'm just speculating

2277
02:20:32,128 --> 02:20:36,736
Could be totally off

2278
02:20:37,248 --> 02:20:40,064
Clips out of larger things I gave you

2279
02:20:40,832 --> 02:20:41,600
Did you say

2280
02:20:41,856 --> 02:20:44,416
Endocrinologist show you I could be speculating

2281
02:20:44,928 --> 02:20:46,720
Right you said they're clearly Act

2282
02:20:47,744 --> 02:20:49,536
In what you're striving for me is Atkins

2283
02:20:49,792 --> 02:20:50,560
A sandwich

2284
02:20:51,584 --> 02:20:52,352
Where there is

2285
02:20:52,608 --> 02:20:53,888
A mass shooting

2286
02:20:54,656 --> 02:20:58,496
That everybody involved in the mass shooting has to be in on the hoax right

2287
02:20:59,008 --> 02:20:59,776
Forge work

2288
02:21:04,128 --> 02:21:06,432
I didn't think if he and Alex would say yes

2289
02:21:06,688 --> 02:21:09,760
That seemed that seemed a little bit surprising

2290
02:21:10,528 --> 02:21:13,856
You're pretty satisfying because there is a recognition that he has that

2291
02:21:14,112 --> 02:21:15,904
Yeah this only makes sense if

2292
02:21:16,160 --> 02:21:16,672
Like

2293
02:21:17,184 --> 02:21:20,768
Its sprawling as hell he's got to be G

2294
02:21:21,024 --> 02:21:27,168
Yeah and it is appreciated

2295
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:28,704
Just like

2296
02:21:29,216 --> 02:21:35,360
I know it's not a way that was it that was a pistols at dawn

2297
02:21:35,616 --> 02:21:41,760
F*** you for saying that get outside we're throwing hands how dare you there are a couple moments like that

2298
02:21:42,016 --> 02:21:48,160
I mean don't make human

2299
02:21:48,416 --> 02:21:52,768
Let so much salad

2300
02:21:54,816 --> 02:22:00,960
Alex one of the things that's really important for him in terms of framing his behavior

2301
02:22:01,216 --> 02:22:07,360
You're around Sandy Hook is he needs people to not be aware of how aware he was of wolf

2302
02:22:07,616 --> 02:22:11,712
Gang how big is action because if he is aware of them

2303
02:22:11,968 --> 02:22:15,296
Then platforming Wolfgang helping him fundraise

2304
02:22:15,808 --> 02:22:17,344
It kind of

2305
02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:20,160
Becomes problematic

2306
02:22:20,416 --> 02:22:26,304
I am so in this setting Alex tries to really limit his awareness

2307
02:22:26,816 --> 02:22:27,840
She knew that how big was going

2308
02:22:29,632 --> 02:22:30,912
And you knew that he was going up there

2309
02:22:34,496 --> 02:22:35,520
And you had

2310
02:22:36,288 --> 02:22:37,568
Mr. Crowley going to show just

2311
02:22:37,824 --> 02:22:38,848
A few days after that

2312
02:22:40,128 --> 02:22:40,896
Board of Education meeting

2313
02:22:44,224 --> 02:22:44,992
I don't remember me

2314
02:22:45,760 --> 02:22:47,808
Were you aware

2315
02:22:48,064 --> 02:22:48,576
That

2316
02:22:50,624 --> 02:22:51,136
Mr. halbig

2317
02:22:51,648 --> 02:22:53,184
When he visited Newtown

2318
02:22:54,464 --> 02:22:54,976
Had

2319
02:22:57,280 --> 02:22:59,072
Engaged in a confrontation at the newt

2320
02:22:59,328 --> 02:22:59,840
Firehouse

2321
02:23:02,144 --> 02:23:03,424
I know there were some complications

2322
02:23:07,520 --> 02:23:08,032
Remember that

2323
02:23:08,288 --> 02:23:09,312
Yeah confrontation

2324
02:23:10,080 --> 02:23:10,592
Police

2325
02:23:11,104 --> 02:23:12,640
United Way charity

2326
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:23,136
Ida Bailey remember

2327
02:23:24,416 --> 02:23:25,696
Sinbad

2328
02:23:25,952 --> 02:23:26,720
People yelling at each other

2329
02:23:30,560 --> 02:23:31,328
Play

2330
02:23:38,496 --> 02:23:39,008
Yes

2331
02:23:39,264 --> 02:23:39,776
56

2332
02:23:43,616 --> 02:23:44,384
May 13th

2333
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:45,664
2014 interview

2334
02:23:50,272 --> 02:23:50,784
Steve

2335
02:23:56,160 --> 02:24:02,304
What do you think really happened to Sandy Hook

2336
02:24:02,560 --> 02:24:08,448
Your will

2337
02:24:10,496 --> 02:24:11,008
So

2338
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:12,288
You recalled it

2339
02:24:12,544 --> 02:24:14,336
Protagonist

2340
02:24:14,592 --> 02:24:15,104
I'm aware that

2341
02:24:15,360 --> 02:24:15,872
He had had

2342
02:24:16,128 --> 02:24:16,640
Confrontational

2343
02:24:16,896 --> 02:24:17,408
Eastern Europe

2344
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:18,688
At telling with eight

2345
02:24:18,944 --> 02:24:19,456
Police cars at

2346
02:24:21,760 --> 02:24:27,904
This just reminded me stuff you know what you guys are actually helping me out today

2347
02:24:28,160 --> 02:24:34,304
How about that I didn't remember that yet so before this interview that you did with him you were aware of

2348
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:37,120
Of him harassing people of United Way

2349
02:24:37,632 --> 02:24:43,008
You have an interesting way of trying to frame it is it a request that the police were stopping him from the butt

2350
02:24:43,264 --> 02:24:49,408
Happy that is it may you knew about it yourself

2351
02:24:49,664 --> 02:24:51,456
Number of

2352
02:24:51,712 --> 02:24:57,856
Things that I'm just not including in here and Maddie walks Alex through bun

2353
02:24:58,112 --> 02:25:04,256
Much of the alleged anomalies that how big had about the Sandy Hook right and then there's the explanation of

2354
02:25:04,768 --> 02:25:10,912
You knew this wasn't true so I'm not gay

2355
02:25:11,168 --> 02:25:15,264
Didn't include much of it except for places where it is a little bit interesting

2356
02:25:15,520 --> 02:25:18,080
Such as this the discussion of the

2357
02:25:18,336 --> 02:25:19,872
Bloomberg email

2358
02:25:20,128 --> 02:25:22,176
They posted this email

2359
02:25:22,432 --> 02:25:23,968
It has become

2360
02:25:24,480 --> 02:25:25,760
A new thing now

2361
02:25:26,016 --> 02:25:32,160
It's not so much about the Bloomberg Bloomberg email isn't the Bloomberg email it's right now maybe like a

2362
02:25:32,416 --> 02:25:33,184
The gun group

2363
02:25:33,440 --> 02:25:38,560
Bloomberg

2364
02:25:39,072 --> 02:25:40,864
That email that you're referencing

2365
02:25:45,472 --> 02:25:46,496
You never been able to produce

2366
02:25:47,776 --> 02:25:48,544
Abilify

2367
02:25:49,824 --> 02:25:52,128
There was years and years later like five years after

2368
02:25:52,896 --> 02:25:53,664
Plus I got six

2369
02:25:54,688 --> 02:25:55,968
But you're you're

2370
02:25:57,504 --> 02:26:00,064
Why don't you why don't you show the email to your audience

2371
02:26:00,576 --> 02:26:01,088
As further proof

2372
02:26:01,600 --> 02:26:02,880
I do remember all the shows

2373
02:26:03,904 --> 02:26:04,928
He was an activist

2374
02:26:05,440 --> 02:26:07,744
Get ready we need to be ready for the

2375
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:09,792
Batman shooting

2376
02:26:11,584 --> 02:26:12,096
You should email

2377
02:26:14,912 --> 02:26:15,936
Yes it was a suicide

2378
02:26:18,752 --> 02:26:20,544
Gmail

2379
02:26:21,312 --> 02:26:21,824
Story

2380
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:28,992
Explain that to me little bit more

2381
02:26:29,504 --> 02:26:31,808
In a communication saying get ready for mass shooting

2382
02:26:32,576 --> 02:26:33,088
Right

2383
02:26:33,856 --> 02:26:37,440
Understand the difference between email and Report

2384
02:26:40,512 --> 02:26:41,280
What did you figure out

2385
02:26:42,048 --> 02:26:43,328
Communication

2386
02:26:53,568 --> 02:26:54,336
You remember which

2387
02:26:54,592 --> 02:26:55,104
Which group

2388
02:27:02,528 --> 02:27:03,808
You were asked about that email

2389
02:27:06,624 --> 02:27:07,136
I believe so yes

2390
02:27:09,440 --> 02:27:12,768
Did you acknowledge in your Texas deposition that you are wrong that you did not

2391
02:27:13,280 --> 02:27:14,816
At the email you were referencing

2392
02:27:15,072 --> 02:27:15,584
Actually

2393
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:16,352
Antenna

2394
02:27:18,144 --> 02:27:19,168
Did you refresh my memory

2395
02:27:19,936 --> 02:27:20,704
Can I use it

2396
02:27:20,960 --> 02:27:22,240
Have you got it all answer

2397
02:27:22,496 --> 02:27:23,776
Refresh my memory what they showed me

2398
02:27:24,032 --> 02:27:25,312
Well I mean you testified in

2399
02:27:25,824 --> 02:27:27,872
In Texas just a few months ago in December

2400
02:27:29,664 --> 02:27:30,432
I don't I don't

2401
02:27:31,456 --> 02:27:31,968
Talkabouttd

2402
02:27:33,248 --> 02:27:35,808
I'll walk out of here damn I remember this feeling

2403
02:27:36,576 --> 02:27:39,392
I hope you do because I'm going to ask you this tomorrow

2404
02:27:40,160 --> 02:27:46,304
So just it's it's on

2405
02:27:46,560 --> 02:27:50,400
That he has no memory

2406
02:27:50,656 --> 02:27:53,472
At a certain point if I'm if I'm Chris here

2407
02:27:53,728 --> 02:27:55,520
I'm just like hey everybody stop

2408
02:27:56,032 --> 02:27:59,872
Turn the cameras off all the lawyers leave Alex is just you and me

2409
02:28:00,128 --> 02:28:03,968
I promise you I will not say a word about what we talked about

2410
02:28:04,736 --> 02:28:05,504
What's argon okay

2411
02:28:06,016 --> 02:28:12,160
Stop gaslighting me you and I both know right and you and I both know I'll pretend that I have no idea if you just allow me

2412
02:28:18,816 --> 02:28:24,960
Little bit Mad Men especially when it's combined with the moving of the goalposts

2413
02:28:25,216 --> 02:28:31,360
You know like it's not a Bloomberg email from the day before now it's a group that put out a report or something

2414
02:28:31,616 --> 02:28:32,640
At some point

2415
02:28:32,896 --> 02:28:38,784
You know it's so vague as to be meaningless now whereas it was like a Smoking Gun for him before

2416
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:40,832
No I did it is it is like

2417
02:28:41,088 --> 02:28:47,232
You have assaulted my reality for so long I need this from you right now just tell me you

2418
02:28:47,488 --> 02:28:53,632
Just tell me you know and that I live in reality and that you're a f****** liar

2419
02:28:54,400 --> 02:28:57,728
So we talked about this a little bit earlier but

2420
02:28:57,984 --> 02:29:04,128
Overwhelming sense that I get from Alex as I listen to more of these

2421
02:29:04,384 --> 02:29:06,176
Directions

2422
02:29:06,432 --> 02:29:10,784
He really seems to have an emotional shut off where he

2423
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:12,576
Refuses to accept

2424
02:29:13,088 --> 02:29:16,672
Things about his past Behavior right and so like

2425
02:29:17,440 --> 02:29:21,792
You're asking about like did you review that show no I didn't

2426
02:29:22,048 --> 02:29:28,192
Probably part of the reason is because you don't want to have a fresh memory other

2427
02:29:28,448 --> 02:29:29,728
It's just it just

2428
02:29:29,984 --> 02:29:31,264
Thinks of cowardice

2429
02:29:31,776 --> 02:29:34,080
Gobble up John you is is that is that

2430
02:29:35,360 --> 02:29:37,152
I'm mentally don't think anybody could

2431
02:29:37,920 --> 02:29:38,432
Like me

2432
02:29:40,992 --> 02:29:42,016
All the time and be

2433
02:29:42,272 --> 02:29:43,040
Even have saying

2434
02:29:44,064 --> 02:29:47,136
Okay well I wish I was talking to Sandy Hook absolutely make mistakes yet

2435
02:29:47,904 --> 02:29:48,416
Man

2436
02:29:49,440 --> 02:29:55,328
Like my brain recoils from exit all I hear

2437
02:29:59,680 --> 02:30:01,216
That I have a coping strategy

2438
02:30:01,728 --> 02:30:04,288
Do not do not dwell on this route

2439
02:30:05,312 --> 02:30:05,824
It's just

2440
02:30:06,336 --> 02:30:07,104
Delicious dishes

2441
02:30:07,616 --> 02:30:08,384
Changsho

2442
02:30:09,408 --> 02:30:10,688
Completely off

2443
02:30:12,480 --> 02:30:13,248
That I

2444
02:30:15,552 --> 02:30:16,832
Just basically

2445
02:30:17,088 --> 02:30:18,112
Put this out of my mind

2446
02:30:18,624 --> 02:30:19,648
And I'm trying my best Anson

2447
02:30:23,488 --> 02:30:25,792
Just want you guys to have your antifreeze speech

2448
02:30:26,048 --> 02:30:26,816
Show trial

2449
02:30:27,328 --> 02:30:29,632
Get over with bigger stuff to your deal whatever

2450
02:30:30,144 --> 02:30:32,192
They just move on to whatever edit the next

2451
02:30:33,216 --> 02:30:35,776
Mystery

2452
02:30:36,032 --> 02:30:39,872
That's enough that's not respond to the question I asked you if you just want to say

2453
02:30:40,128 --> 02:30:41,408
I want to see this you know

2454
02:30:41,664 --> 02:30:42,432
Because there been several

2455
02:30:46,272 --> 02:30:47,808
That I or I guess

2456
02:30:48,576 --> 02:30:49,088
Warriors

2457
02:30:50,880 --> 02:30:51,392

First Amendment

2460
02:30:57,536 --> 02:30:59,328
And I mean you you look at me with that

2461
02:31:00,096 --> 02:31:00,608
Face

2462
02:31:01,120 --> 02:31:02,144
But you

2463
02:31:02,400 --> 02:31:04,960
The Democrats are going Free Speech everywhere

2464
02:31:05,216 --> 02:31:06,240
Cancel culture

2465
02:31:09,056 --> 02:31:09,568
What brought this

2466
02:31:11,616 --> 02:31:12,128
AR

2467
02:31:12,384 --> 02:31:12,896
Family

2468

Who lost

2469
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:15,968
Children

2470
02:31:16,224 --> 02:31:16,736
And relative

2471
02:31:18,272 --> 02:31:19,040
Do you understand that

2472
02:31:19,808 --> 02:31:21,344
And I understand it's being used by

2473
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:23,136
Democratic party the media

2474
02:31:23,392 --> 02:31:25,952
It wants you and I just hit the second over the first known as well

2475
02:31:26,208 --> 02:31:28,256
Like last week saying

2476
02:31:28,768 --> 02:31:30,048
Basically get rid of the First Amendment

2477
02:31:30,560 --> 02:31:32,864
And don't ask questions I mean it's ridiculous

2478
02:31:42,336 --> 02:31:43,616
It was used

2479
02:31:44,384 --> 02:31:45,664
Baby doll shows

2480
02:31:46,432 --> 02:31:47,968
And the now this is being used

2481
02:31:49,248 --> 02:31:50,784
As well

2482
02:31:51,040 --> 02:31:54,112
And so they may think you can compartmentalize this with

2483
02:31:54,624 --> 02:31:56,160
New York Times vs. Sullivan

2484
02:32:00,512 --> 02:32:01,792
Add Velveeta

2485
02:32:03,072 --> 02:32:05,120
Well this is going is he

2486
02:32:05,376 --> 02:32:06,144
Extremely

2487
02:32:06,656 --> 02:32:08,704
Dangerous river volume be

2488
02:32:09,728 --> 02:32:12,800
I understand.

2489
02:32:13,312 --> 02:32:13,824
And

2490
02:32:14,080 --> 02:32:14,592
Dad

2491
02:32:15,360 --> 02:32:18,176
And that's what that is I'm just telling you that I'm really trying to answer

2492
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:19,968
Objective

2493
02:32:20,224 --> 02:32:20,736
Today's numbers

2494
02:32:21,248 --> 02:32:21,760
But

2495
02:32:22,272 --> 02:32:23,040
I've heard what you said

2496
02:32:23,296 --> 02:32:24,320
And so

2497
02:32:24,576 --> 02:32:25,600
Maybe we don't need to have

2498
02:32:25,856 --> 02:32:26,368
Speeches

2499
02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:27,392
Anymore

2500
02:32:27,648 --> 02:32:28,928
Arbor spots

2501
02:32:29,184 --> 02:32:35,328
Okay obviously a woe-is-me yes to this which is

2502
02:32:35,584 --> 02:32:38,656
Pretty tired I would

2503
02:32:39,168 --> 02:32:42,752
I think it's also like really disrespectful and

2504
02:32:43,008 --> 02:32:45,056
Shameful the way that this is

2505
02:32:45,312 --> 02:32:46,848
He's processing all of this

2506
02:32:47,104 --> 02:32:48,640
But I do kind of think

2507
02:32:48,896 --> 02:32:55,040
Dad based on the way he's describing this it is a coping mechanism for him

2508
02:32:55,296 --> 02:32:56,576
Deal with the fact that

2509
02:32:56,832 --> 02:32:59,904
You know he took and out of context

2510
02:33:00,160 --> 02:33:02,464
Deceptively edited clip

2511
02:33:02,720 --> 02:33:07,328
From when Robbie Parker was coming onto stage and he terrorized him

2512
02:33:07,584 --> 02:33:11,936
He doesn't want to recognize that the rest of that speech was a heartfelt

2513
02:33:12,192 --> 02:33:16,544
I think the moment of Grace honestly and end

2514
02:33:19,360 --> 02:33:24,992
I wouldn't want to either I get it I understand that but you like

2515
02:33:25,760 --> 02:33:27,808
The alternative here is just pathetic

2516
02:33:28,320 --> 02:33:30,880
At a certain point you have to

2517
02:33:32,672 --> 02:33:38,816
And you can see it just so clearly the way the star song we almost Cesar Moment of Truth

2518
02:33:39,072 --> 02:33:45,216
A lot of people will

2519
02:33:45,472 --> 02:33:51,616
Dumas Guru know in the way that he is it when Maddie is is

2520
02:33:51,872 --> 02:33:53,152
Is really trying to like

2521
02:33:53,664 --> 02:33:55,456
Okay fine you up

2522
02:33:55,712 --> 02:33:56,224
1

2523
02:33:56,480 --> 02:33:57,760
I'm proud of him

2524
02:33:58,016 --> 02:33:59,040
Battery for not

2525
02:33:59,552 --> 02:34:04,160
It's sinking his teeth and whenever Alex is like I'm tired I just want this all to go away like

2526
02:34:11,072 --> 02:34:13,376
Proud of him for that

2527
02:34:13,888 --> 02:34:20,032
You know but that moment where he's getting that you understand what we're doing here I understand you think the first time

2528
02:34:20,288 --> 02:34:23,616
Amendment 2nd Amendment all of that stuff but you know that it's about the families

2529
02:34:24,128 --> 02:34:26,688
Alex cannot let that sit for a sec

2530
02:34:26,944 --> 02:34:33,088
A media instantly using the families and they're all it has to be insta

2531
02:34:33,344 --> 02:34:36,416
Because if he is allowed to sit with that thought for a second

2532
02:34:36,672 --> 02:34:37,184
He's fought

2533
02:34:37,440 --> 02:34:38,720
He's f***** them

2534
02:34:39,232 --> 02:34:45,376
The recognition of that pierces his arguments 22 strong lady

2535
02:34:45,632 --> 02:34:47,680
Not even a breath in between

2536
02:34:47,936 --> 02:34:54,080
I also listening to this and this next clip also I mean it is definitely a sense that I get that lawyer should

2537
02:34:54,336 --> 02:35:00,480
I mean maybe it's never really needed to happen before but now they need an objection that is just shut up

2538
02:35:00,736 --> 02:35:06,880
Cut it out a******

2539
02:35:07,136 --> 02:35:08,928
Longitude meaning with speech

2540
02:35:17,888 --> 02:35:19,680
Ridiculous

2541
02:35:25,568 --> 02:35:26,336
Who are you

2542
02:35:27,360 --> 02:35:27,872
Mocking there

2543
02:35:30,176 --> 02:35:31,200
You have to understand that

2544
02:35:31,712 --> 02:35:32,992
All American

2545
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:35,808
Abuela

2546
02:35:37,088 --> 02:35:37,856
The car all car

2547
02:35:39,648 --> 02:35:40,160
Tired

2548
02:35:43,232 --> 02:35:44,000
So then it becomes

2549
02:35:44,256 --> 02:35:45,024
Conscious and then

2550
02:35:46,560 --> 02:35:47,072
Everything

2551
02:35:48,608 --> 02:35:49,120
Media

2552
02:35:49,376 --> 02:35:50,656
And the Brain figures outlays

2553
02:35:52,192 --> 02:35:53,216
Cruises to horrible

2554
02:35:53,728 --> 02:35:54,240
Imagine

2555
02:35:54,496 --> 02:35:55,264
Children like that

2556
02:35:55,520 --> 02:35:56,032
Executed

2557
02:35:57,312 --> 02:35:57,824
Talk about this

2558
02:35:58,848 --> 02:36:01,664
The real quick will get back to this man during speech but

2559
02:36:02,432 --> 02:36:08,576
Dwayne is describing this this is not questioning things this is this is somebody who bully

2560
02:36:08,832 --> 02:36:14,976
Leaves that a group that he identifies as being a part of his being blamed for things that they're not

2561
02:36:15,232 --> 02:36:19,584
And then deciding that in order to not have to

2562
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:24,192
Face that scrutiny that he imagines and not have to

2563
02:36:24,448 --> 02:36:30,592
Defend this group I will make things up about event that I find threat

2564
02:36:30,848 --> 02:36:31,360
Threatening to

2565
02:36:31,616 --> 02:36:34,944
Is that group it's bizarre it's it's not

2566
02:36:36,224 --> 02:36:42,368
It seems like if Alex can articulate this then he should be able to take the next step and

2567
02:36:42,624 --> 02:36:45,184
Recognize that he has done

2568
02:36:45,696 --> 02:36:48,512
Throughout his career if it fits this mold

2569
02:36:48,768 --> 02:36:49,536
Is

2570
02:36:50,304 --> 02:36:51,328
Just

2571
02:36:51,584 --> 02:36:52,352
Bulshit

2572
02:36:53,376 --> 02:36:58,496
I think. Questioning things it's up standing up to the establishment anyway

2573
02:36:58,752 --> 02:37:00,032
Know what's

2574
02:37:00,288 --> 02:37:05,920
What it is I think I ate it something that we is is really under examined but

2575
02:37:06,176 --> 02:37:08,480
I feel like what happened to the conservative right

2576
02:37:08,736 --> 02:37:10,272
Whenever everybody was like

2577
02:37:10,528 --> 02:37:14,368
Hey maybe racism and homophobia and all that stuff is bad right

2578
02:37:14,624 --> 02:37:15,648
Don't say that in public

2579
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:16,672
Raped

2580
02:37:16,928 --> 02:37:23,072
They created a different language out of our language you know they created this whole

2581
02:37:23,328 --> 02:37:29,472
Okay well with water, we know what we mean when we say this right

2582
02:37:29,984 --> 02:37:36,128
But the problem is right we really saying exactly

2583
02:37:36,384 --> 02:37:38,688
Sending things I don't mean question things

2584
02:37:38,944 --> 02:37:40,736
That's not my language right

2585
02:37:40,992 --> 02:37:47,136
So we find ourselves in a situation where these two languages are at complete odds with each other because Alec

2586
02:37:47,392 --> 02:37:50,976
Language is built entirely around lying about what the words mean

2587
02:37:51,744 --> 02:37:57,888
Yeah they're made they're maybe we might need a linguist quite frankly to pierce through

2588
02:37:58,144 --> 02:38:04,288
You would need to understand all of the ways that they lie or that they tell each other the truth and lie

2589
02:38:04,544 --> 02:38:09,664
Lie to us you know I think that might be why are

2590
02:38:09,920 --> 02:38:15,296
Understanding of Alex's slightly different than a lot of other folks the immersion in the language

2591
02:38:15,552 --> 02:38:16,832
Of his b*******

2592
02:38:17,088 --> 02:38:19,648
Anyway here get ready for a bunch of that language right

2593
02:38:19,904 --> 02:38:22,208
I ran with it but I'm on I'm happy that

2594
02:38:22,720 --> 02:38:23,232
It's really true

2595
02:38:23,744 --> 02:38:25,024
I didn't consciously

2596
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:26,048
Get up there

2597
02:38:26,560 --> 02:38:28,352
I try to misrepresent a lot of people

2598
02:38:28,864 --> 02:38:30,144
I've gotten somewhat better over the

2599
02:38:30,912 --> 02:38:31,936
Both want to say is that

2600
02:38:36,544 --> 02:38:38,336
Hey I'm not older has taught me how to do things better

2601
02:38:40,128 --> 02:38:41,408
Well

2602
02:38:42,432 --> 02:38:43,712
And I don't have a second

2603
02:38:43,968 --> 02:38:44,992
I said is almost

2604
02:38:45,248 --> 02:38:46,784
Like a form of that

2605
02:38:47,296 --> 02:38:48,576
It's happening everywhere work

2606
02:38:48,832 --> 02:38:49,344
People don't believe

2607
02:38:49,600 --> 02:38:50,112
Anything

2608
02:38:51,392 --> 02:38:53,952
From the corporate media with a dumber either because they've been lying

2609
02:38:55,232 --> 02:38:56,768
And it's really the systems fault

2610
02:38:57,280 --> 02:38:57,792
People

2611
02:38:58,048 --> 02:38:59,328
Have lost total pump

2612
02:39:00,608 --> 02:39:02,656
Cumberland silverware Thompson Center

2613
02:39:03,168 --> 02:39:06,496
And it is a real crisis and I were at right around this time

2614
02:39:07,008 --> 02:39:08,544
Pulling away

2615
02:39:09,056 --> 02:39:11,104
From everything

2616
02:39:12,640 --> 02:39:13,664
And I was Beau Bridges

2617
02:39:14,432 --> 02:39:16,480
And I'm Bill Hicks

2618
02:39:17,248 --> 02:39:17,760
And Chris

2619
02:39:18,016 --> 02:39:19,296
Crazy people playing my office and

2620
02:39:19,552 --> 02:39:20,064
And you know

2621
02:39:20,320 --> 02:39:21,344
Shanghai was covering up

2622
02:39:21,600 --> 02:39:23,904
Shooting in Texas and I was there

2623
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:25,696
I was at first and I just started

2624
02:39:26,208 --> 02:39:27,744
Just cuz the media lie so much

2625
02:39:29,792 --> 02:39:31,072
Doesn't mean every time it is

2626
02:39:31,584 --> 02:39:32,608
And I saw

2627
02:39:32,864 --> 02:39:33,376
Let the craziness

2628
02:39:34,912 --> 02:39:36,960
Established 12 sensor on a stop anybody Quest

2629
02:39:37,984 --> 02:39:40,288
The other guy over here believing nothing I say

2630
02:39:40,544 --> 02:39:41,312
Finding reasons not to

2631
02:39:41,568 --> 02:39:42,080
Believe it

2632
02:39:42,336 --> 02:39:44,128
Friday's great lunch during of the Abyss

2633
02:39:47,968 --> 02:39:49,760
You know what went on here and then

2634
02:39:50,272 --> 02:39:52,576
As soon as I began to say I don't want

2635
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:54,112
Michelle

2636
02:39:54,368 --> 02:39:55,904
You got the emails and stuff I don't want

2637
02:39:57,952 --> 02:40:01,280
So do people said that I was on the government payroll that I was covering up

2638
02:40:01,536 --> 02:40:02,048
Sandy Hook

2639
02:40:07,168 --> 02:40:07,680
You can imagine

2640
02:40:08,448 --> 02:40:08,960
So

2641
02:40:12,544 --> 02:40:15,360
The question I asked you was

2642
02:40:15,616 --> 02:40:19,712
Videos

2643
02:40:25,088 --> 02:40:25,600
And I'm going to

2644
02:40:26,112 --> 02:40:26,880
Exact same question

2645
02:40:27,136 --> 02:40:28,672
Answer my

2646
02:40:30,464 --> 02:40:36,608
So one of Alex's obvious strategies is just keep talking and hope people forget where this star

2647
02:40:36,864 --> 02:40:40,448
The question was who are you mocking In that clip

2648
02:40:40,704 --> 02:40:45,056
Mne everything he was saying had nothing to do with that it was just

2649
02:40:45,568 --> 02:40:46,080
Caulking

2650
02:40:46,592 --> 02:40:48,640
And it's things that he is

2651
02:40:48,896 --> 02:40:55,040
You know it's these wrote speeches that needs given repeatedly if these meaningless platitudes

2652
02:40:55,296 --> 02:41:01,184
Dudes and you know it's it it's really really effective because I think that generally speaking when you're not

2653
02:41:01,440 --> 02:41:04,768
Dealing with a lawyer who doesn't care about your b*******

2654
02:41:05,792 --> 02:41:11,936
You're going to be able to keep talking until someone latches onto one of the things that you're saying it boom you're off the topic

2655
02:41:12,192 --> 02:41:14,240
But yep that you don't want to talk about

2656
02:41:14,496 --> 02:41:20,384
Alex doesn't want to recognize that he was mocking this person

2657
02:41:20,896 --> 02:41:27,040
So I got to work in this room but maybe maybe everywhere else I believe that every lawyer in a

2658
02:41:27,296 --> 02:41:29,088
America should listen to this

2659
02:41:29,344 --> 02:41:34,208
Not to learn anything but because they should all feel jealous of Chris

2660
02:41:34,464 --> 02:41:36,512
Not because he got a billion-dollar judgment

2661
02:41:36,768 --> 02:41:42,912
Which is f****** great I'm sure a lot of lawyers I bet would wish they had billion-dollar judgment over there being only

2662
02:41:43,168 --> 02:41:49,312
Better is being norm and losing what they should all be jealous of is the moment that Chris

2663
02:41:49,568 --> 02:41:51,104
Bruschetta

2664
02:41:51,360 --> 02:41:55,712
F****** it is nice to papa papa

2665
02:41:56,480 --> 02:42:02,624
So the subject of Adan Salazar's article the FBI says no one

2666
02:42:02,880 --> 02:42:03,392
I was killed

2667
02:42:03,648 --> 02:42:05,440
In Sandy Hook Right comes up

2668
02:42:05,696 --> 02:42:09,280
We learned that that article was b*******

2669
02:42:09,536 --> 02:42:11,584
In a very interesting way

2670
02:42:12,096 --> 02:42:14,912
I don't believe the story at all but

2671
02:42:15,168 --> 02:42:21,056
After Alex tells this nonsensical story he throws a dawn under a bus

2672
02:42:21,312 --> 02:42:22,080
Just asking you today

2673
02:42:22,336 --> 02:42:23,616
About any conversation

2674
02:42:23,872 --> 02:42:24,384
You recall having with

2675
02:42:24,896 --> 02:42:25,408
Salazar

2676
02:42:25,664 --> 02:42:26,688
About this particular art

2677
02:42:30,528 --> 02:42:31,296
If sometime

2678
02:42:32,320 --> 02:42:33,856
A few years ago before lawyers product

2679
02:42:34,880 --> 02:42:36,160
I was born.

2680
02:42:38,720 --> 02:42:40,000
Somebody to coffee shop

2681
02:42:41,024 --> 02:42:42,048
Came over and said

2682
02:42:42,560 --> 02:42:43,840
Your f****** piece of s***

2683
02:42:44,352 --> 02:42:48,960
Their laptop looking to State Police

2684
02:42:49,728 --> 02:42:51,776
And then everyone in Sansome to Adan about it

2685
02:42:52,544 --> 02:42:53,568
And I'm a black guy

2686
02:42:55,616 --> 02:43:00,992
That was the first time I heard about it

2687
02:43:01,504 --> 02:43:02,528
Situating time

2688
02:43:03,040 --> 02:43:04,064
This conversation

2689
02:43:04,320 --> 02:43:07,648
Do you have the coffee shop I don't remember

2690
02:43:08,160 --> 02:43:10,720
And then you obviously from there

2691
02:43:10,976 --> 02:43:12,000
Had a conversation with Donna.

2692
02:43:12,512 --> 02:43:14,560
And you think that was before

2693
02:43:14,816 --> 02:43:16,352
This lawsuit was filed

2694
02:43:20,960 --> 02:43:23,264
Yeah they was like right around before the time

2695
02:43:25,568 --> 02:43:26,080
1

2696
02:43:26,848 --> 02:43:30,176
Rap for Trump almost went out of my San Diego cell.

2697
02:43:30,432 --> 02:43:30,944
Ashley

2698
02:43:31,200 --> 02:43:32,480
Are those all back then

2699
02:43:33,248 --> 02:43:35,040
Added somebody yelled at me

2700
02:43:35,808 --> 02:43:36,320
Amman

2701
02:43:36,832 --> 02:43:40,160
And then I remember saying I'm sexy I told you this is bulshit

2702
02:43:40,928 --> 02:43:45,280
We argued about it. I respected all I can only reporting all this stuff

2703
02:43:45,536 --> 02:43:46,048
Think about

2704
02:43:50,400 --> 02:43:56,544
No more CC no more no more this person yelled at me in a coffee shop

2705
02:43:56,800 --> 02:44:02,944
Wow

2706
02:44:03,200 --> 02:44:04,480
The next trial song

2707
02:44:04,736 --> 02:44:09,088
Alex has to testify in a soundproof glass booth

2708
02:44:09,344 --> 02:44:09,856
Alright

2709
02:44:10,112 --> 02:44:15,488
So we can see him there red button green button yes no

2710
02:44:15,744 --> 02:44:16,256
Alright

2711
02:44:16,512 --> 02:44:22,656
And if we need a more complicated answer there is a flap that will open that went nuts that would be interesting

2712
02:44:22,912 --> 02:44:29,056
I also think that more and more about this

2713
02:44:29,312 --> 02:44:31,104
I could have gotten a trial

2714
02:44:31,360 --> 02:44:31,872
Like

2715
02:44:32,640 --> 02:44:34,944
F*** you imagine if

2716
02:44:35,200 --> 02:44:40,832
There was a court case and they got to call people like a dawn a dawn B

2717
02:44:41,088 --> 02:44:44,672
All these people to the stand Alex would be huge lose

2718
02:44:44,928 --> 02:44:46,208
Harder than a default

2719
02:44:46,720 --> 02:44:52,864
It would be it would be worse if only I got lucky you didn't

2720
02:44:53,120 --> 02:44:58,240
Get a trial I mean what they call that dirty laundry in a court setting like terrible idea

2721
02:44:58,496 --> 02:45:01,824
Terrible idea if it was a criminal trial crimes would be

2722
02:45:02,336 --> 02:45:03,616
Just off mad

2723
02:45:04,640 --> 02:45:06,432
May I ask who will boy

2724
02:45:08,224 --> 02:45:11,552
Wolfgang and Alex's conspiracies continue

2725
02:45:12,576 --> 02:45:13,344
To be discussed

2726
02:45:13,600 --> 02:45:18,720
And Alex can't answer any of the questions about the this b******* they've been saying

2727
02:45:54,560 --> 02:45:57,376
Photos of

2728
02:46:03,519 --> 02:46:04,287
So I want to ask you

2729
02:46:05,055 --> 02:46:05,567
We about

2730
02:46:06,335 --> 02:46:06,847
Claim you made

2731
02:46:08,127 --> 02:46:08,639
Yeah

2732
02:46:08,895 --> 02:46:09,407
School of Art

2733
02:46:09,663 --> 02:46:10,431
You have a school of 100

2734
02:46:10,687 --> 02:46:11,455
Kids and nobody can find a

2735
02:46:13,503 --> 02:46:14,015
Woody talking

2736
02:46:14,783 --> 02:46:16,575
I don't know the context this years ago

2737
02:46:17,087 --> 02:46:18,367
When you say you have a

2738
02:46:19,135 --> 02:46:21,183
Not just one but a bunch of parents

2739
02:46:21,951 --> 02:46:22,975
Who are fake crying

2740
02:46:26,047 --> 02:46:29,375
Who you talking about I don't remember left Matilda videos I would have said that

2741
02:46:30,911 --> 02:46:32,703
When you say you have a photo of a bunch of

2742
02:46:32,959 --> 02:46:33,471
Kids

2743
02:46:33,727 --> 02:46:35,007
Two are still alive

2744
02:46:35,263 --> 02:46:36,287
That they say die

2745
02:46:36,543 --> 02:46:37,311
What photo are Utah

2746
02:46:38,335 --> 02:46:39,615
I don't know which one that is

2747
02:46:39,871 --> 02:46:41,919
What you talking about the Super Bowl

2748
02:46:42,175 --> 02:46:43,711
Photo that mr. halbig sent you

2749
02:46:44,223 --> 02:46:50,367
The audience maybe ohmygod Alex has already been deposed in Texas and had a long conversation.

2750
02:46:50,623 --> 02:46:52,927
About that photo and

2751
02:46:53,183 --> 02:46:54,207
How dumb it is

2752
02:46:54,719 --> 02:46:57,535
Tell me the answer here is very strange as if he doesn't

2753
02:46:57,791 --> 02:47:03,167
If you remembered that he should be a guy can't I don't know I don't remember she might be at

2754
02:47:03,423 --> 02:47:06,495
Like I don't know I don't know what I was talking about

2755
02:47:06,751 --> 02:47:12,895
I've no idea I must have banged it on something cuz I wouldn't just make it up

2756
02:47:13,151 --> 02:47:19,295
The problem of thought thought process again you don't want to recognize that

2757
02:47:19,551 --> 02:47:21,855
You just make s*** up and

2758
02:47:23,391 --> 02:47:26,207
When your face is evidence of making s*** up

2759
02:47:27,231 --> 02:47:28,767
I must have based it on something

2760
02:47:30,815 --> 02:47:32,863
Magoffin the

2761
02:47:33,119 --> 02:47:38,239
The illusion of it there is something there is is powerful

2762
02:47:38,751 --> 02:47:44,895
You know what this might be the ultimate test case for that that phenomenon of being

2763
02:47:45,151 --> 02:47:51,295
If you're confronted by somebody who fix something differently than you your natural defensiveness makes you defended

2764
02:47:51,551 --> 02:47:52,319
Position that maybe

2765
02:47:52,575 --> 02:47:55,135
If you weren't locked in that headspace

2766
02:47:55,391 --> 02:47:59,231
At you could slowly kind of tease your way out you know that kind of thing you know

2767
02:47:59,487 --> 02:48:04,607
The more forceful year do a year or disagreed with the more likely you are to disagree back with Force

2768
02:48:05,631 --> 02:48:06,143
What

2769
02:48:06,399 --> 02:48:09,215
Like of all the people who have studied that

2770
02:48:10,239 --> 02:48:11,519
What would it take

2771
02:48:12,031 --> 02:48:12,543
For Alice

2772
02:48:13,055 --> 02:48:13,567
You know

2773
02:48:15,359 --> 02:48:17,151
What would it take

2774
02:48:17,919 --> 02:48:18,431
Nothing

2775
02:48:18,687 --> 02:48:24,831
I mean like is there is it possible no you know like there's no possible way though I don't think bra

2776
02:48:25,087 --> 02:48:26,111
Another person

2777
02:48:26,367 --> 02:48:32,511
I think it would just take external circumstances you need to find a position where it be more profitable for him to

2778
02:48:32,767 --> 02:48:33,791
Recognize things

2779
02:48:34,047 --> 02:48:40,191
That's probably that's

2780
02:48:40,447 --> 02:48:41,983
Can sharkera force of nature or something

2781
02:48:42,239 --> 02:48:46,847
I wouldn't I wouldn't see the force of nature

2782
02:48:47,103 --> 02:48:53,247
Something something that is is outside of any kind of control what's the weather

2783
02:48:53,503 --> 02:48:59,647
A****** Sharpshooter shark papa papa

2784
02:49:00,159 --> 02:49:00,671
Yelp

2785
02:49:00,927 --> 02:49:07,071
Get up that shows that there was a giant in traffic on the day that add-ons article

2786
02:49:07,327 --> 02:49:12,191
And Wolfgang was on that correspondent with a big spike in Revenue

2787
02:49:12,703 --> 02:49:17,823
And Alex said something here that maybe he shouldn't have

2788
02:49:18,079 --> 02:49:20,383
Because it reveals

2789
02:49:20,639 --> 02:49:22,431
Potential

2790
02:49:22,687 --> 02:49:28,831
Failure to turn over data a man those crimes are tough to remember which ones are with this one

2791
02:49:29,087 --> 02:49:33,183
Norm tells him to shut up

2792
02:49:35,487 --> 02:49:36,255
And you'd agree with me

2793
02:49:36,767 --> 02:49:38,559
Bedroom three day. You published

2794
02:49:38,815 --> 02:49:39,583
False report

2795
02:49:39,839 --> 02:49:40,607
That the FBI

2796
02:49:40,863 --> 02:49:42,143
Headset nobody died at Sandy Hook

2797
02:49:42,655 --> 02:49:43,423
US Bank in traffic

2798
02:49:43,679 --> 02:49:48,031
I can show you times when we cover Sandy Hook Emily has left viewers

2799
02:49:50,335 --> 02:49:50,847
There

2800
02:49:51,103 --> 02:49:51,615
You've got

2801
02:49:51,871 --> 02:49:54,687
Other friends

2802
02:50:01,599 --> 02:50:03,135
Your business manager

2803
02:50:03,647 --> 02:50:04,415
Temperature

2804
02:50:04,927 --> 02:50:05,439
Sending

2805
02:50:05,695 --> 02:50:06,207
These

2806
02:50:06,975 --> 02:50:07,743
Did your data

2807
02:50:07,999 --> 02:50:08,511
About to put

2808
02:50:08,767 --> 02:50:14,143
Performance of the website

2809
02:50:14,399 --> 02:50:14,911
But

2810
02:50:15,167 --> 02:50:15,935
That them

2811
02:50:22,335 --> 02:50:23,103
Does analysis

2812
02:50:24,639 --> 02:50:29,247
These guys

African last money in the shopping cart so you know that

2814
02:50:37,183 --> 02:50:38,719
So it's something you can produce

2815
02:50:38,975 --> 02:50:39,487
That's right

2816
02:50:40,767 --> 02:50:42,047

Some sort of analysis

2821

A corresponding relationship

2828

Between

2829
02:51:07,647 --> 02:51:08,415
When you got her standing up

2830
02:51:08,671 --> 02:51:09,183
Is traffic

2831
02:51:09,695 --> 02:51:11,487
That should have been produced

2832
02:51:11,743 --> 02:51:12,255
Store store

2833
02:51:12,767 --> 02:51:13,279

No

2846
02:51:49,631 --> 02:51:51,935
This is really this really

2847
02:51:58,335 --> 02:52:02,687
A good Norm had two objects to just Alex talkin man

2848
02:52:02,943 --> 02:52:03,711
Yeah

2849
02:52:03,967 --> 02:52:10,111
There's a lot of problems with the idea that this exists first of all

2850
02:52:10,367 --> 02:52:12,159
Yeah that wasn't turned over that was

2851
02:52:12,415 --> 02:52:18,559
Required to be turned over there is an internal definition Within

2852
02:52:18,815 --> 02:52:24,959
Scores of the times that I was talked about Sandy Hook which would be interesting to compare to what they turned over

2853
02:52:25,215 --> 02:52:31,359
Seems like they didn't turn over everything so this is this is deeply deeply problematic for Alex

2854
02:52:31,615 --> 02:52:37,759
He's not just making s*** up which she probably is just making sure. That is a good like back door

2855
02:52:38,015 --> 02:52:44,159
For all of Alex's lawyers committing crimes as they could just be like he's lying about it and what are you going to say

2856
02:52:44,415 --> 02:52:48,511
You're probably right he is probably

2857
02:52:49,023 --> 02:52:55,167
So they end up looking at an article I believe it's the Arctic the FBI are

2858
02:52:55,423 --> 02:52:55,935
Articles

2859
02:52:56,447 --> 02:52:59,263
And Alex C use a banner on

2860
02:52:59,519 --> 02:53:00,031
No

2861
02:53:00,287 --> 02:53:06,431
Her DNA for Alex's not have ideas desert

2862
02:53:06,687 --> 02:53:08,223
Alex

2863
02:53:08,479 --> 02:53:09,759
Gets it in his head

2864
02:53:10,015 --> 02:53:16,159
That he can argue that the reason there was a giant spike in sales and traffic Ono

2865
02:53:16,415 --> 02:53:22,559
Cuz DNA force was back on sale for you telling me that Alex is going to try and win this case in this deposition

2866
02:53:22,815 --> 02:53:26,143
Right here right now

2867
02:53:26,399 --> 02:53:26,911
Pull up

2868
02:53:28,191 --> 02:53:29,215
We just pulled back up

2869
02:53:29,983 --> 02:53:32,799
Is exactly what you described earlier then

2870
02:53:33,311 --> 02:53:35,359
When you publish this article you were running

2871
02:53:35,871 --> 02:53:36,383
A

2872
02:53:36,639 --> 02:53:37,151
33

2873
02:53:37,407 --> 02:53:37,919
Percent off

2874
02:53:38,175 --> 02:53:39,711
Sale on DNA Force

2875
02:53:39,967 --> 02:53:40,735
Plus which

2876
02:53:41,503 --> 02:53:42,015
You're saying

2877
02:53:42,271 --> 02:53:43,807
Recently back in ShopRite

2878
02:53:44,831 --> 02:53:45,343
Yes we do

2879
02:53:45,599 --> 02:53:46,111
And

2880
02:53:46,367 --> 02:53:47,391
And your advertising

2881
02:53:49,695 --> 02:53:51,487
That was getting a spike in traffic

2882
02:53:51,743 --> 02:53:52,767
That week your website

2883
02:53:53,023 --> 02:53:54,303
Correct

2884
02:53:55,071 --> 02:53:55,583
Well you don't know

2885
02:53:59,935 --> 02:54:00,959
Sitting here today Underoath

2886
02:54:01,215 --> 02:54:02,495
Did that advertisement Randolph

2887
02:54:03,007 --> 02:54:04,287
On every page

2888
02:54:04,543 --> 02:54:05,823
Of your website on Netflix

2889
02:54:10,687 --> 02:54:11,199
Computer

2890
02:54:11,455 --> 02:54:13,759
And it replaces them on their whatever the Nevada

2891
02:54:14,271 --> 02:54:20,415
So we have a possible explanation that Alex's found

2892
02:54:20,671 --> 02:54:26,047
The giant spike in in sales because forces back on

2893
02:54:26,303 --> 02:54:30,143
This does not account for the gigantic spike in traffic

2894
02:54:30,399 --> 02:54:34,239
That wouldn't necessarily correlate

2895
02:54:34,495 --> 02:54:37,567
So there is some confusion but

2896
02:54:38,079 --> 02:54:41,663
You know there's also an argument to be made that

2897
02:54:41,919 --> 02:54:48,063
You had a sale that you were advertising on article that was going viral that was a lie about

2898
02:54:49,087 --> 02:54:51,391
Yeah maybe that doesn't actually help

2899
02:54:51,647 --> 02:54:57,535
But Alex is so excited he's so thrilled that he's found a way to argue that

2900
02:54:57,791 --> 02:55:00,863
That was a static banner and whatever we put there is everywhere

2901
02:55:01,375 --> 02:55:02,399
That's the number one Banner

2902
02:55:02,911 --> 02:55:04,191
Is Suzy in a foreskin

2903
02:55:07,263 --> 02:55:08,031
And if there are more

2904
02:55:09,823 --> 02:55:10,335
Sinbad

2905
02:55:11,103 --> 02:55:11,615
You're selling more

2906
02:55:12,639 --> 02:55:15,967
Yes but meet me at slowly but we didn't plan that make sense

2907
02:55:16,223 --> 02:55:17,759
We didn't premeditatedly

2908
02:55:18,015 --> 02:55:19,807
Amazon write that article

2909
02:55:29,023 --> 02:55:31,327
A product came back and then I'm like boom

2910
02:55:34,655 --> 02:55:36,191
Ygopro

2911
02:55:37,471 --> 02:55:38,239
And it's going to because of

2912
02:55:38,495 --> 02:55:39,519
The product

2913
02:55:39,775 --> 02:55:40,799
Popular

2914
02:55:41,567 --> 02:55:43,615
Has come back yet I know what sell stuff

2915
02:55:44,383 --> 02:55:44,895
Product

2916
02:55:45,151 --> 02:55:46,431
And it's also your pip

2917
02:55:47,199 --> 02:55:50,271
I mean your your your own best. We have it on auto-ship

2918
02:55:53,855 --> 02:55:54,367
Do you have

2919
02:55:54,879 --> 02:55:55,391
The first day

2920
02:55:56,415 --> 02:55:56,927
The auto-ship

2921
02:55:57,695 --> 02:55:58,207
Yes and

2922
02:55:59,743 --> 02:56:01,023
And the people that want to get it

2923
02:56:04,607 --> 02:56:06,399
You know how long this added been running

2924
02:56:07,167 --> 02:56:07,679
I'll buy the price

2925
02:56:07,935 --> 02:56:08,703
September 20th

2926
02:56:11,775 --> 02:56:12,543
Because BC

2927
02:56:14,591 --> 02:56:15,871
Do you know how long

2928
02:56:20,479 --> 02:56:23,551
Just got to try and get back

2929
02:56:24,063 --> 02:56:30,207
He got so excited to be like he's found a way that thinks

2930
02:56:30,463 --> 02:56:33,535
Is explanatory a way to get around this

2931
02:56:34,047 --> 02:56:40,191
Very clear piece of evidence they've all had one moment at least it everyday

2932
02:56:40,447 --> 02:56:46,591
Deposition that we've seen Dari I remember had a big one I can't remember exactly about what but I remember

2933
02:56:46,847 --> 02:56:52,991
For all the sudden like cuz she's been presbycusis Sunshine comes through the window

2934
02:56:53,247 --> 02:56:59,391
Pick 4 hours and then all the sudden she gripped on something and she's like I've got this

2935
02:56:59,647 --> 02:57:00,927
Can you possibly be there

2936
02:57:01,183 --> 02:57:07,327
Why are you sick like up for sports like what why are you game to like

2937
02:57:07,583 --> 02:57:13,727
See what you can do later gone near this is just shut down man

2938
02:57:13,983 --> 02:57:20,127
I can win what are you doing we're not in a winner lose to tonight situation

2939
02:57:20,383 --> 02:57:22,431
Disaster for you idiot

2940
02:57:22,943 --> 02:57:29,087
So Alex famously in his the clips of him saying

2941
02:57:29,343 --> 02:57:29,855
Play with actors

2942
02:57:30,111 --> 02:57:32,415
He claims that he did deep research

2943
02:57:32,927 --> 02:57:38,559
And so Chris Mattie that'll tries to figure out what was that research exactly

2944
02:57:54,687 --> 02:57:55,199
Didn't

2945
02:58:01,343 --> 02:58:02,111
The other stuff

2946
02:58:03,391 --> 02:58:03,903
I do want to ask

2947
02:58:07,999 --> 02:58:08,511
Some of that was wrong

2948
02:58:10,559 --> 02:58:11,327
Deep research that

2949
02:58:11,583 --> 02:58:12,095
You did

2950
02:58:12,351 --> 02:58:13,119
Please don't

2951
02:58:14,655 --> 02:58:15,167
What did you do

2952
02:58:16,959 --> 02:58:18,239
Videos going over there

2953
02:58:18,495 --> 02:58:19,775
Duration later Island

2954
02:58:23,871 --> 02:58:24,895
Only got her today

2955
02:58:25,919 --> 02:58:26,431
What's going on

2956
02:58:31,295 --> 02:58:33,087
You haven't shared with me

2957
02:58:33,599 --> 02:58:34,879
Did the Deep research

2958
02:58:35,647 --> 02:58:37,183
You personally over

2959
02:58:37,951 --> 02:58:38,463
Okay

2960
02:58:38,975 --> 02:58:40,255
We're almost at a bridge

2961
02:58:40,511 --> 02:58:41,023
Delicious

2962
02:58:44,607 --> 02:58:45,631
You said that you didn't deep

2963
02:58:46,911 --> 02:58:47,423
Alright

2964
02:58:49,215 --> 02:58:49,727
Now

2965
02:58:51,007 --> 02:58:51,519
I want under

2966
02:58:51,775 --> 02:58:52,287
1st and

2967
02:58:53,823 --> 02:58:54,591
Comprehensively is you

2968
02:58:56,127 --> 02:58:56,639
What that

2969
02:58:58,943 --> 02:58:59,455
Volume two

2970
02:59:01,503 --> 02:59:02,015
Research

2971
02:59:02,527 --> 02:59:03,807
Had led you to that conclusion

2972
02:59:04,063 --> 02:59:04,575
That the whole thing

2973
02:59:06,367 --> 02:59:06,879
So

2974
02:59:07,391 --> 02:59:07,903
What research

2975
02:59:09,695 --> 02:59:11,487
Watching videos reading

2976
02:59:11,743 --> 02:59:12,255
Transcripts

2977
02:59:26,847 --> 02:59:27,359
Curious

2978
02:59:30,431 --> 02:59:31,711
I just a whole background other things

2979
02:59:32,735 --> 02:59:33,503
It looked to me like

2980
02:59:41,695 --> 02:59:42,207
Of that

2981
02:59:42,975 --> 02:59:43,487
Pretty soon after this

2982
02:59:43,999 --> 02:59:50,143
That has nothing to do with this there's no research I guess maybe he could pretend like I looked deep

2983
02:59:50,399 --> 02:59:52,191
Ugly into Fast & Furious by like

2984
02:59:52,447 --> 02:59:57,823
That doesn't have to do with Sandy Hook unless you make it about it you're making

2985
02:59:58,079 --> 03:00:03,967
I watched videos what videos Roi watch transcript what transcript

2986
03:00:04,223 --> 03:00:10,367
That's a situation where you really have to like dig even deeper when you just use the word like okay

2987
03:00:11,135 --> 03:00:14,463
Before we get into deep freezer dodo Nono

2988
03:00:14,719 --> 03:00:20,607
The word research mean to you like a regular research before going to deep what's a regular razor made out of this

2989
03:00:21,119 --> 03:00:23,935
Ask me a question like I'm Alex okay

2990
03:00:24,447 --> 03:00:25,727
What deep research

2991
03:00:25,983 --> 03:00:28,799
Did you do I dug deep within my mind

2992
03:00:29,055 --> 03:00:32,895
I took Ayahuasca and I meditated and I spoke to the plant

2993
03:00:33,407 --> 03:00:39,551
That makes more sense than anything else you've said so far

2994
03:00:39,807 --> 03:00:45,951
Did my spirit Guru a problem because they're in this situation where they feel like they

2995
03:00:46,207 --> 03:00:49,535
They're on a battlefield you know where they can go battle

2996
03:00:49,791 --> 03:00:51,327
And maybe they can win or lose

2997
03:00:51,839 --> 03:00:55,167
But reality is you either have you can either go like

2998
03:00:55,423 --> 03:00:56,703
Non-Stop

2999
03:00:56,959 --> 03:00:57,727
Wall

3000
03:00:57,983 --> 03:01:03,359
I've just like I'm not answering I'm not answering I'm not answering or completely fictional

3001
03:01:03,871 --> 03:01:10,015
Commitment to not knowing anything and ask questions like what deep research dude you already know the answer

3002
03:01:10,271 --> 03:01:16,415
Obviously going to be empty words that means I didn't do anything

3003
03:01:16,671 --> 03:01:22,559
For Alex it didn't make they think that there's like a way out there's like some sort of way out and there's no way out

3004
03:01:23,071 --> 03:01:29,215
The only way to play this game is not playing it for you yeah well you should have done stuff differently a decade ago

3005
03:01:29,471 --> 03:01:35,615
Every year since if you're in this position you should just cooperate

3006
03:01:35,871 --> 03:01:42,015
Kitchens with yes or no and you get through it cuz this is not helping I mean

3007
03:01:42,271 --> 03:01:42,783
Stateville

3008
03:01:43,039 --> 03:01:49,183
They keep thinking like oh no the problem is they don't have another exactly

3009
03:01:49,439 --> 03:01:51,743
So if you said yes or no to every question

3010
03:01:51,999 --> 03:01:54,559
There are questions you would not have had the answer

3011
03:01:54,815 --> 03:01:57,119
True

3012
03:01:57,375 --> 03:02:00,703
Less bad because you're making yourself look bad because

3013
03:02:00,959 --> 03:02:04,543
The reason you're here is because the things you did that made you make you look bad

3014
03:02:04,799 --> 03:02:09,407
But you think you're going to peel these lawyers and Nathan amazing

3015
03:02:09,663 --> 03:02:15,807
So we get back to how big then and basically this is going chronologically throughout

3016
03:02:16,063 --> 03:02:16,831
You know the the

3017
03:02:17,087 --> 03:02:23,231
The events that happened to before right York Sandy Hook Alex's coverage of it as it goes through

3018
03:02:23,487 --> 03:02:25,023
And so

3019
03:02:25,535 --> 03:02:27,839
At this point how big is on

3020
03:02:29,631 --> 03:02:30,911
He has a

3021
03:02:31,167 --> 03:02:37,311
Reveal to Alex that his wife does not believe him right that was a fun one

3022
03:02:37,567 --> 03:02:38,847
Alex's asked about this

3023
03:02:39,359 --> 03:02:41,919
You did know I haven't watched it that looking Zone wife

3024
03:02:42,687 --> 03:02:43,967
Found him not credible on

3025
03:02:44,735 --> 03:02:45,247
Correct

3026
03:02:46,271 --> 03:02:48,575
I believe reminds me of its washing their clothes

3027
03:02:48,831 --> 03:02:50,623
Did that cause you to question whether Mr

3028
03:02:50,879 --> 03:02:54,207
How big Zone wife

3029
03:02:59,583 --> 03:03:00,607
But having heard that

3030
03:03:02,655 --> 03:03:03,935
Exxon wife

3031
03:03:04,703 --> 03:03:05,727
Found him not credible

3032
03:03:07,007 --> 03:03:07,519
You still

3033
03:03:08,287 --> 03:03:09,055
Promoted mr. Biggs

3034
03:03:10,079 --> 03:03:10,591
Right

3035
03:03:12,127 --> 03:03:14,943
I was just being nice

3036
03:03:15,967 --> 03:03:18,783
And it will you just be nice to him when you sent mr. bhadana TF2

3037
03:03:19,039 --> 03:03:19,551
The Connecticut

3038
03:03:20,063 --> 03:03:21,087
Just two months later

3039
03:03:21,599 --> 03:03:25,951
To report his activities

3040
03:03:26,207 --> 03:03:27,487
I want to see what's going on

3041
03:03:27,743 --> 03:03:29,535
Amazing

3042
03:03:29,791 --> 03:03:30,303
June

3043
03:03:30,559 --> 03:03:32,095
A 2015 Audi

3044
03:03:32,351 --> 03:03:34,143
The two months later you send mr. badanti up

3045
03:03:34,399 --> 03:03:35,167
Connecticut correct

3046
03:03:37,983 --> 03:03:40,287
I don't remember last

3047
03:03:41,567 --> 03:03:42,847
You'll never talk about Junior 20

3048
03:03:43,103 --> 03:03:43,871
15 last time

3049
03:03:44,895 --> 03:03:45,407
You're talkin about

3050
03:03:45,663 --> 03:03:46,175
2014

3051
03:03:46,431 --> 03:03:48,991
Explain what happened to that I

3052
03:03:49,247 --> 03:03:53,855
Didn't want to be mean to me. It was a bad person

3053
03:03:58,463 --> 03:03:59,231
RAB do

3054
03:04:02,559 --> 03:04:05,119
Okay so for by June or 2015

3055
03:04:05,887 --> 03:04:07,423
You would said to Rob do another

3056
03:04:07,679 --> 03:04:08,447
I did not want

3057
03:04:08,959 --> 03:04:09,471
Downey report

3058
03:04:11,775 --> 03:04:12,543
Yes

3059
03:04:12,799 --> 03:04:14,591
Pop back up then I don't remember

3060
03:04:17,663 --> 03:04:18,431
I just asked you

3061
03:04:18,943 --> 03:04:19,711
Weather

3062
03:04:19,967 --> 03:04:21,759
I just asked you what it was your small intestine

3063
03:04:24,063 --> 03:04:26,623
Okay well that's what we're here to figure out okay

3064
03:04:26,879 --> 03:04:28,159
So your recollection

3065
03:04:28,415 --> 03:04:30,463
Is that by June of 2015

3066
03:04:30,975 --> 03:04:32,255
You had told Rob do

3067
03:04:32,511 --> 03:04:35,071
That you did not want them to Donnie reporting for you any longer

3068
03:04:35,327 --> 03:04:40,191
Yes.i'd puzzle before that and I'm sure you'll show me when they pop back up every dinner I can't remember

3069
03:04:40,959 --> 03:04:43,007
And you didn't have that conversation with Dan but Dundee

3070
03:04:43,263 --> 03:04:43,775
Yourself at that

3071
03:04:44,543 --> 03:04:45,311
Did you order

3072
03:04:46,335 --> 03:04:49,151
No I know I told Rob you told Rob

3073
03:04:49,407 --> 03:04:50,431
Prior to June 25th

3074
03:04:50,687 --> 03:04:52,479
15 that you did not want that.

3075
03:04:52,991 --> 03:04:53,503
For you right

3076
03:04:54,271 --> 03:04:56,575
Yes okay well this is a trap

3077
03:04:56,831 --> 03:05:02,975
But I was just being nice

3078
03:05:03,231 --> 03:05:06,303
Hey what are you going to do when all else fails

3079
03:05:06,559 --> 03:05:10,399
Fall back on politeness as your listen I'm a Texas boy

3080
03:05:10,911 --> 03:05:17,055
You just got to be nice if there's ever been a case for it's cruel to be kind

3081
03:05:17,311 --> 03:05:23,199
Here's my big failing with this whole Sandy Hook too nice to nice to people nice to the wrong people now

3082
03:05:23,455 --> 03:05:24,223
You get burned

3083
03:05:24,735 --> 03:05:27,039
I have it is it is weird

3084
03:05:27,295 --> 03:05:33,439
Listening to these these discs these depositions after all of them really start coming in

3085
03:05:33,695 --> 03:05:34,207
It's just like

3086
03:05:34,719 --> 03:05:36,511
They don't want to be held responsible

3087
03:05:36,767 --> 03:05:38,559
For anything they say

3088
03:05:38,815 --> 03:05:41,887
And I'm not talking about anything they said about Sandy Hook

3089
03:05:42,143 --> 03:05:48,287
I'm talking about if they were like a listen I'm going to go I think I just had a Coke and you be like did you have a Coke in the Blackwell

3090
03:05:48,543 --> 03:05:54,687
I don't know for sure if I had a Coke right now just be responsible for one thing you say

3091
03:05:54,943 --> 03:06:01,087
I am a on our Facebook group that someone asked me if I ever made the lasagna I said I was going to make

3092
03:06:01,343 --> 03:06:07,487
No comment no you did not yet

3093
03:06:07,743 --> 03:06:08,511
Sensitive

3094
03:06:09,023 --> 03:06:11,583
Just one thing

3095
03:06:11,839 --> 03:06:17,983
So Alex is now steaks position

3096
03:06:18,239 --> 03:06:24,383
Takes a position that is unspeakable for Alex well now we get to what will be

3097
03:06:24,639 --> 03:06:30,783
Is the rest of the deposition of just discussing dhanbad Andy and his trip to Newtown

3098
03:06:31,039 --> 03:06:33,855
2015 price

3099
03:06:34,111 --> 03:06:34,623
Now

3100
03:06:35,391 --> 03:06:37,183
This is pretty expertly.

3101
03:06:37,439 --> 03:06:41,791
I would say I think that Maddie does a great job of

3102
03:06:42,303 --> 03:06:48,191
Well I mean he's already trapped Alex with the putting a date on when he said to stop it with Madonna

3103
03:06:48,703 --> 03:06:54,847
So now he plays Alex some video of badonde and it's the video of him harassing the police chief

3104
03:06:55,103 --> 03:06:56,383
Right I am yelling at him

3105
03:06:56,895 --> 03:07:00,991
And he gets a good sir Alex to

3106
03:07:01,247 --> 03:07:03,551
Talk about how bad this is

3107
03:07:04,063 --> 03:07:05,855
You're aware that mr.

3108
03:07:07,391 --> 03:07:07,903
To Connecticut

3109
03:07:08,159 --> 03:07:09,439
In June 2015 report

3110
03:07:09,695 --> 03:07:10,207
Right

3111
03:07:10,463 --> 03:07:10,975
No.

3112
03:07:11,487 --> 03:07:12,511
Remember all this

3113
03:07:16,095 --> 03:07:16,863
Let's pull up

3114
03:07:17,119 --> 03:07:17,631
Exhibit

3115
03:07:20,191 --> 03:07:20,959
100

3116
03:07:21,471 --> 03:07:21,983
Hey

3117
03:07:34,015 --> 03:07:37,343
The gentleman

3118
03:07:37,855 --> 03:07:38,879
Blue on blue striped shirt

3119
03:07:40,671 --> 03:07:42,207
Okay do you know who he's trailing trying to ask question

3120
03:07:49,631 --> 03:07:52,703
WC it has truth radio show.com in the lower right-hand corner

3121
03:07:54,751 --> 03:07:57,567
And you see this infowars.com in the lower left-hand corner

3122
03:07:57,823 --> 03:07:58,335
Alright

3123
03:07:58,591 --> 03:08:00,127
And you're aware that

3124
03:08:00,383 --> 03:08:01,663
Mr. Daddy sent this footage

3125
03:08:01,919 --> 03:08:02,943
To Infowars right

3126
03:08:04,223 --> 03:08:05,247
I believe he publishes

3127
03:08:07,039 --> 03:08:10,367
Usually something then but still put in for

3128
03:08:12,927 --> 03:08:15,743
You published this video are you aware that

3129
03:08:16,511 --> 03:08:19,071
Okay so it's not true

3130
03:08:19,327 --> 03:08:21,375
We'll get to it but it's not true

3131
03:08:21,887 --> 03:08:24,447
That you didn't that he was doing his own thing and it

3132
03:08:24,703 --> 03:08:25,983
He wasn't up there for you

3133
03:08:26,239 --> 03:08:32,383
Objection does obsess over this point

3134
03:08:32,639 --> 03:08:38,783
I don't remember exactly when I believe it around then.

3135
03:08:39,295 --> 03:08:39,807
About that

3136
03:08:40,063 --> 03:08:42,111
I told you this song

3137
03:08:42,879 --> 03:08:49,023
Yeah so it's this is going to Cascade Alex's illusions

3138
03:08:49,279 --> 03:08:51,583
What he did with batondy

3139
03:08:51,839 --> 03:08:54,143
And their relationship become

3140
03:08:54,399 --> 03:08:57,471
Transparently alive

3141
03:08:57,727 --> 03:09:03,871
And it's fun to watch I will be honest it's you know there's this stuff that's really heavy with like a few

3142
03:09:04,127 --> 03:09:07,455
Choosing to say any names because he doesn't know any of the names of the children.

3143
03:09:07,711 --> 03:09:10,015
People who were killed the

3144
03:09:10,271 --> 03:09:16,415
Outburst and accusations they could that's not really that makes me feel a little uncomfortable

3145
03:09:16,927 --> 03:09:17,695
Delightful and

3146
03:09:17,951 --> 03:09:21,791
It's a real nice to watch Alex try and wiggle his way around like

3147
03:09:22,303 --> 03:09:28,447
Do this does feel like he's so filled with skewers at this point Chris might as

3148
03:09:28,703 --> 03:09:29,727
Kobe an acupuncturist

3149
03:09:29,983 --> 03:09:36,127
And now we're about to close the Iron Maiden door on his face

3150
03:09:36,383 --> 03:09:37,407
Buy a cameraman

3151
03:09:37,663 --> 03:09:39,967
Who uses some dirty language boy

3152
03:09:40,223 --> 03:09:41,503
And the person is operating

3153
03:09:41,759 --> 03:09:42,527
The camera who's that

3154
03:09:44,319 --> 03:09:45,087
Is your testimony that

3155
03:09:45,343 --> 03:09:45,855
That person

3156
03:09:46,367 --> 03:09:46,879
Was working as

3157
03:09:47,135 --> 03:09:47,647
Contract

3158
03:09:48,159 --> 03:09:48,671
Cameron

3159
03:09:49,951 --> 03:09:50,463
You sure about that

3160
03:09:51,231 --> 03:09:52,767
I don't know I don't know that person is

3161
03:10:02,751 --> 03:10:04,543
Can you pause it

3162
03:10:04,799 --> 03:10:05,823
Did you hear

3163
03:10:06,847 --> 03:10:07,615
The gentleman operating

3164
03:10:07,871 --> 03:10:08,383
The camera

3165
03:10:08,639 --> 03:10:09,151
Refer to this purse

3166
03:10:12,479 --> 03:10:12,991
Crooked corrupt

3167
03:10:16,831 --> 03:10:18,111
That's obviously not

3168
03:10:21,695 --> 03:10:22,207
Not good

3169
03:10:22,463 --> 03:10:26,047
Probably shouldn't say that

3170
03:10:26,303 --> 03:10:30,655
Yeah yeah that's usually not a good one to go with

3171
03:10:30,911 --> 03:10:37,055
So Alex is being shown this video and it's so inappropriate

3172
03:10:37,311 --> 03:10:43,455
He has no alternative but to say like yeah.

3173
03:10:43,711 --> 03:10:49,855
I was using that Infowars logo but he wasn't really ever even he wasn't allowed to this is bad behavior

3174
03:10:50,111 --> 03:10:56,255
We talked about this afterwards HR got on top of it my dad was right there

3175
03:10:56,511 --> 03:10:59,583
But yeah he tries he's just trying to pretend like we have no relationship

3176
03:11:00,095 --> 03:11:05,727
Deposit return

3202
03:12:31,487 --> 03:12:32,767
That is highly

3203
03:12:33,279 --> 03:12:34,303
Inappropriate

3204
03:12:35,583 --> 03:12:36,607
Well I mean

3205
03:12:37,375 --> 03:12:41,215
Our government lied about wmds and directly storytimes highly highly wrong

3206
03:12:44,543 --> 03:12:45,823
You guys look Heroes everything

3207
03:12:46,079 --> 03:12:48,895
But I mean I don't remember all the details of this and I'm answering

3208
03:12:49,151 --> 03:12:49,663
Finger questions

3209
03:12:51,455 --> 03:12:51,967
I just asked you

3210
03:12:52,223 --> 03:12:52,735
Weather

3211
03:12:52,991 --> 03:12:54,527
The footage we just saw is entirely in a

3212
03:13:00,415 --> 03:13:03,487
People to make their own opinion out of that first amendment

3213
03:13:05,023 --> 03:13:05,535
Objection

3214
03:13:08,351 --> 03:13:09,631
I mean I don't like how

3215
03:13:11,167 --> 03:13:12,447
But that's the Kraken right

3216
03:13:12,959 --> 03:13:14,751
You know what you expected a Dandy

3217
03:13:15,775 --> 03:13:16,799
No not that

3218
03:13:18,335 --> 03:13:19,615
Let's keep going with 100b

3219
03:13:20,383 --> 03:13:22,175
Yeah so I mean

3220
03:13:22,943 --> 03:13:29,087
Do you have the deflection

3221
03:13:29,343 --> 03:13:35,487
Question secondarily you have this video that I was being shown there is legitimately no way

3222
03:13:35,743 --> 03:13:40,095
You know Alex can't spend this

3223
03:13:40,351 --> 03:13:46,495
There is just like the cameraman called people f****** piece of s***

3224
03:13:46,751 --> 03:13:50,591
Yelling you're going to prison this is not like

3225
03:13:50,847 --> 03:13:53,407
Anything you could stand behind

3226
03:13:54,175 --> 03:13:58,783
It's tough It's a disgrace.

3227
03:13:59,039 --> 03:14:02,879
Yep I did I didn't know this you did Alex Alex

3228
03:14:03,391 --> 03:14:09,535
Right now you are wearing an iHeart but dandi tank-top do you not understand what we are doing right here at a bunch

3229
03:14:09,791 --> 03:14:15,935
To the warehouse along time ago and I take the laundry day

3230
03:14:16,191 --> 03:14:20,799
It raises the value I just signed all of them buddies back in the day

3231
03:14:23,871 --> 03:14:30,015
You know you got these people who are making a crime accusations to people in Newtown

3232
03:14:30,271 --> 03:14:35,135
Alex has posed the question of whether or not the first amendment protect you

3233
03:14:35,391 --> 03:14:37,951
If you make false crime accusations

3234
03:14:38,207 --> 03:14:44,351
Operation

3235
03:14:48,959 --> 03:14:50,751
Did you see mr. madani Derek use

3236
03:14:52,287 --> 03:14:53,823
Cheap Newtown Police of perjury

3237
03:14:55,871 --> 03:14:56,895
But that's personal run

3238
03:14:57,407 --> 03:15:00,223
Okay anybody saw he accused the chief police of crime correct

3239
03:15:01,503 --> 03:15:02,015
Yes

3240
03:15:02,271 --> 03:15:04,831
And you have no idea what the basis for that accusation was

3241
03:15:07,391 --> 03:15:09,183
I mean I don't know

3242
03:15:11,999 --> 03:15:14,303
Is it is it somebody's personal it right mr. Jones

3243
03:15:14,815 --> 03:15:20,959
To falsely accuse somebody of a friend

3244
03:15:22,751 --> 03:15:23,775
Is it your view

3245
03:15:24,031 --> 03:15:25,311
That the First Amendment

3246
03:15:27,359 --> 03:15:28,895
Protect somebody from

3247
03:15:29,407 --> 03:15:30,943
Falsely accusing somebody of a crime

3248
03:15:31,711 --> 03:15:34,527
If that is if that's his opinion

3249
03:15:34,783 --> 03:15:37,599
I don't know the context of us ever again, not after no contact

3250
03:15:38,367 --> 03:15:38,879
My opinion

3251
03:15:39,391 --> 03:15:40,415
Okay but you know that it

3252
03:15:40,671 --> 03:15:43,743
If I were to accuse you of a crime mr. Jones and I have no

3253
03:15:43,999 --> 03:15:45,535
A reasonable basis for doing that

3254
03:15:46,047 --> 03:15:47,071
Protect

3255
03:15:48,351 --> 03:15:48,863
You claim

3256
03:15:49,631 --> 03:15:51,167
You cleaned up because the judge says

3257
03:15:51,679 --> 03:15:53,471
We gave you frogs on financials is true cuz

3258
03:15:53,727 --> 03:15:58,591
America

3259
03:15:59,103 --> 03:16:00,383
Mr. Jones that you're trying to

3260
03:16:02,687 --> 03:16:03,199
Evade

3261
03:16:04,223 --> 03:16:04,991
A very

3262
03:16:05,759 --> 03:16:07,295
Clear question I've asked you

3263
03:16:07,807 --> 03:16:08,319
About

3264
03:16:10,111 --> 03:16:10,879
The First Amendment

3265
03:16:11,391 --> 03:16:17,535
Can you falsely accuse people of crimes with no basic let me ask you a question

3266
03:16:17,791 --> 03:16:19,327
Is there any sort of law

3267
03:16:19,839 --> 03:16:20,863
That says

3268
03:16:21,119 --> 03:16:23,423
It is against the law

3269
03:16:23,935 --> 03:16:25,983
To falsely accuse someone of a crime

3270
03:16:26,239 --> 03:16:32,383
First member baby okay nevermind so Alex believes that you could do that to public figure

3271
03:16:33,407 --> 03:16:33,919
Somebody

3272
03:16:36,991 --> 03:16:37,503
Definitely

3273
03:16:41,087 --> 03:16:42,111
It's different to say if you were mine

3274
03:16:43,391 --> 03:16:44,415
Or that versus public

3275
03:16:45,695 --> 03:16:47,743
I understand you guys want to broaden to give her the First Amendment

3276
03:16:53,375 --> 03:16:53,887
Action

3277
03:16:54,655 --> 03:16:55,935
When he put himself out there

3278
03:16:56,191 --> 03:16:56,703
Shooting

3279
03:16:57,215 --> 03:16:57,727
Depressed

3280
03:16:59,263 --> 03:17:00,799
And that gave you the right to lie about anything

3281
03:17:04,639 --> 03:17:05,151
Mr. Jones

3282
03:17:05,407 --> 03:17:06,943
Have you ever sued anybody

3283
03:17:07,455 --> 03:17:08,223
For defamation

3284
03:17:11,039 --> 03:17:14,111
I don't know

3285
03:17:18,207 --> 03:17:20,255
So that kind of

3286
03:17:20,511 --> 03:17:22,559
Really seals the

3287
03:17:22,815 --> 03:17:27,679
All the evidence you need that the I don't remember or I don't know answers aren't sincere

3288
03:17:27,935 --> 03:17:29,727
River suit somebody

3289
03:17:29,983 --> 03:17:30,495
I don't know

3290
03:17:31,007 --> 03:17:34,079
But yeah it is

3291
03:17:34,335 --> 03:17:35,871
Of questions was

3292
03:17:36,127 --> 03:17:37,663
Devastating Broward

3293
03:17:37,919 --> 03:17:44,063
He saying that you didn't your First Amendment right to be able to make false accusations against public figures

3294
03:17:44,319 --> 03:17:44,831
Man

3295
03:17:45,087 --> 03:17:51,231
Is Robbie Parker a public figure well Robbie Parker gave a press conference after the shooting and therefore became up

3296
03:17:51,487 --> 03:17:54,815
Figure out who you are then able to fall asleep

3297
03:17:55,071 --> 03:17:57,119
Yep we're excited by that

3298
03:17:57,631 --> 03:17:59,679
Oops po-boy

3299
03:17:59,935 --> 03:18:05,311
A boy that's good that was fun to see Alex kind of

3300
03:18:06,079 --> 03:18:08,639
It is it is always fun whatever

3301
03:18:09,407 --> 03:18:09,919
Like

3302
03:18:10,943 --> 03:18:16,831
There's more than one step and I don't like to this this is a compound series of questions

3303
03:18:17,087 --> 03:18:20,415
That all have a different circuitous route

3304
03:18:20,671 --> 03:18:26,047
To really pin him into this into this hole right here right and he doesn't understand when somebody's

3305
03:18:26,303 --> 03:18:29,887
Walking around him with it in a circle tying it tying a rope

3306
03:18:30,143 --> 03:18:36,287
He doesn't get that he's like they're walking away from me so if I just hang onto this rope I'll never get caught

3307
03:18:36,799 --> 03:18:38,847
Yeah he he does

3308
03:18:40,127 --> 03:18:46,271
Does not seem to it's partially but it feels like obliviousness

3309
03:18:46,527 --> 03:18:47,039
Doesn't care

3310
03:18:48,575 --> 03:18:49,599
I don't know

3311
03:18:52,159 --> 03:18:56,255
If I was going to hunt Alex Jones alright

3312
03:18:57,023 --> 03:19:01,119
Not even a thought would be given to walking out into the forest with a gun

3313
03:19:01,375 --> 03:19:02,655
Not even a thought

3314
03:19:02,911 --> 03:19:09,055
I would just lay traps everywhere and put Pizza on things and I guarantee he would be caught sooner or later

3315
03:19:11,359 --> 03:19:14,431
Discussing this footage the damn dondi ever Newtown

3316
03:19:14,943 --> 03:19:19,295
I mean it's just Alex can't deny it's it's expensive stuff

3317
03:19:19,807 --> 03:19:20,831
Do you know whether Infowars

3318
03:19:21,087 --> 03:19:21,599
Stream

3319
03:19:21,855 --> 03:19:22,623
Uneven Channel

3320
03:19:24,159 --> 03:19:26,207
I don't believe so was I when I saw this

3321
03:19:29,791 --> 03:19:30,303
Stop singing

3322
03:19:31,327 --> 03:19:34,911
Change the subject

3323
03:19:37,727 --> 03:19:39,519
I don't think a bad person

3324
03:19:40,031 --> 03:19:41,823
I just saw the stuff and I definitely

3325
03:19:42,335 --> 03:19:43,359
Dentist office

3326
03:19:46,687 --> 03:19:48,223
Remember all the time frames or when

3327
03:19:48,735 --> 03:19:50,527
The process

3328
03:19:50,783 --> 03:19:52,319
You just

3329
03:19:53,087 --> 03:19:55,647
Right you just testified under oath

3330
03:19:56,159 --> 03:19:57,183
You just testified under oath

3331
03:19:58,207 --> 03:19:58,975
Saw this footage

3332
03:19:59,999 --> 03:20:00,511
And yeah

3333
03:20:01,023 --> 03:20:02,047
Use an expletive

3334
03:20:02,303 --> 03:20:03,071
To whoever you were talking

3335
03:20:04,095 --> 03:20:05,119
Tell him to stop

3336
03:20:09,471 --> 03:20:13,055
What time was it

3337
03:20:13,311 --> 03:20:13,823
I don't remember

3338
03:20:14,335 --> 03:20:15,615
How the heck can you test

3339
03:20:15,871 --> 03:20:16,895
The by Underoath just now

3340
03:20:17,407 --> 03:20:18,175
Let me get my porch now

3341
03:20:18,431 --> 03:20:19,967
How the heck can you testify under oath

3342
03:20:20,479 --> 03:20:22,015
That you know it was around this time

3343
03:20:22,271 --> 03:20:23,807
When you don't even know when this was

3344
03:20:24,063 --> 03:20:27,135
I remember this was Santa and I said this that I don't like

3345
03:20:31,999 --> 03:20:32,767
You're the boss

3346
03:20:35,071 --> 03:20:38,143
There's a lot going on.

3347
03:20:38,399 --> 03:20:39,423
Footage did you not

3348
03:20:40,703 --> 03:20:41,471
I don't know that

3349
03:20:41,983 --> 03:20:42,495
Well

3350
03:20:42,751 --> 03:20:44,799
If you look at this footage when it came in

3351
03:20:45,055 --> 03:20:48,127
And you saw how inappropriate was and how much you didn't like it

3352
03:20:48,639 --> 03:20:49,919
You certainly wouldn't would you

3353
03:20:56,831 --> 03:20:58,367
Gotcha

3354
03:21:01,695 --> 03:21:02,719
If you'd seen this

3355
03:21:03,743 --> 03:21:04,255
4020

3356
03:21:04,511 --> 03:21:05,023
Came in

3357
03:21:05,791 --> 03:21:07,071
And you were so appalled

3358
03:21:09,631 --> 03:21:10,143
Write check

Not that he doesn't work for us anymore

3365
03:21:29,855 --> 03:21:30,623
He's not using

03:21:31,647 --> 03:21:32,415
Check

3367
03:21:35,487 --> 03:21:36,255

Reconvene

3369

So

3370
03:21:40,351 --> 03:21:46,495
Yeah I mean you can kind of already see like what needs to happen for the

3371
03:21:48,031 --> 03:21:54,175
Peanut the stick to fall in the Box

3372
03:21:54,431 --> 03:22:00,575
To that string of questions about all of the things that

3373
03:22:00,831 --> 03:22:06,975
Didn't this video all of these things inappropriate absolutes go ahead and enjoy that

3374
03:22:07,231 --> 03:22:08,255
Isn't this the reason

3375
03:22:08,767 --> 03:22:09,279
Jones

3376
03:22:09,535 --> 03:22:11,327
That you lied when you testified in

3377
03:22:12,351 --> 03:22:12,863
Batondy was not

3378
03:22:15,423 --> 03:22:15,935
Directions

3379
03:22:16,959 --> 03:22:18,751

3382
03:22:23,359 --> 03:22:24,895
Want mr. Jones beat agree with me that

3383
03:22:25,151 --> 03:22:26,431
That was mr. E harassing

3384
03:22:27,711 --> 03:22:28,479
The chief of police

3385
03:22:28,991 --> 03:22:29,503
On a Publix

3386
03:22:30,015 --> 03:22:30,527
In Connecticut

3387
03:22:30,783 --> 03:22:31,295
Correct

3388
03:22:31,551 --> 03:22:36,159
I don't agree with the way he did it but it's God's public figure and this is what you sent him to do

3389
03:22:38,463 --> 03:22:40,255
Was it appropriate for one of your reporters

3390
03:22:40,511 --> 03:22:41,279
First yelled at somebody

3391
03:22:41,535 --> 03:22:42,047
Criminalize

3392
03:22:43,583 --> 03:22:44,095
Objection

3393
03:22:44,607 --> 03:22:49,471
No it's not appropriate for the Now by president for the appropriate for

3394
03:22:50,751 --> 03:22:53,055
Appropriate

3395
03:22:55,103 --> 03:22:57,151
I'm asking you whether I don't hear by anybody else

3396
03:22:57,407 --> 03:22:59,199
Court reporter

3397
03:23:00,479 --> 03:23:01,247
I'm asking

3398
03:23:03,807 --> 03:23:05,855
Repeat the question

3399
03:23:06,879 --> 03:23:08,159
Matthew again

3400
03:23:08,927 --> 03:23:09,951
Was it appropriate

3401
03:23:10,463 --> 03:23:11,743
For Infowars reporter

3402
03:23:12,255 --> 03:23:13,023
To yell

3403
03:23:13,535 --> 03:23:15,327
That somebody is a criminal on a city street

3404
03:23:16,095 --> 03:23:16,607
Yes or no

3405
03:23:19,935 --> 03:23:20,959
Image their free speech

3406
03:23:22,495 --> 03:23:25,567
Was it appropriate for an Infowars in order to

3407
03:23:25,823 --> 03:23:28,127
That's not that's not

3408
03:23:32,223 --> 03:23:36,063
Okay great I'm happy thank you for telling me that

3409
03:23:36,319 --> 03:23:38,111
Hey that man 30 grand

3410
03:23:38,367 --> 03:23:40,415
Was it appropriate for an Infowars reporter to

3411
03:23:40,671 --> 03:23:41,951
Accuse someone of perjury

3412
03:23:43,999 --> 03:23:44,511
Directions

3413
03:23:45,791 --> 03:23:48,607
He wasn't acting kind of weird reporter Mike in my in my view they

3414
03:23:48,863 --> 03:23:49,375
Okay

3415
03:23:49,887 --> 03:23:52,959
Answer my question I don't like them doing that but it's just

3416
03:23:53,471 --> 03:23:55,775
Would have been appropriate for an Infowars reporter

3417
03:23:56,031 --> 03:23:57,055
Or to yell

3418
03:23:57,311 --> 03:24:00,127
At somebody that they're trying to get an interview with have fun in jail

3419
03:24:01,151 --> 03:24:04,735
Appropriate

3420
03:24:07,039 --> 03:24:09,855
Is it appropriate to say you're going to jail for fraud

3421
03:24:13,695 --> 03:24:15,999
And you must have really not like

3422
03:24:16,511 --> 03:24:17,279
When they said

3423
03:24:18,047 --> 03:24:19,327
Infowars.com

3424
03:24:21,119 --> 03:24:22,911
The number one alternative news sources

3425
03:24:29,311 --> 03:24:33,151
Probably probably didn't you probably did actually enjoy because

3426
03:24:33,407 --> 03:24:34,943
Republic yep yep

3427
03:24:35,199 --> 03:24:37,247
He definitely enjoyed it and he loved it

3428
03:24:37,503 --> 03:24:38,271
So

3429
03:24:38,527 --> 03:24:43,135
I will be really unfortunate if there were a clap

3430
03:24:43,647 --> 03:24:49,791
Like Alex saying that he sent batondy there's no way that would be

3431
03:24:50,047 --> 03:24:56,191
That f***** off of that show right that's what he said he didn't do it

3432
03:24:56,447 --> 03:24:57,983
Afterwards privately

3433
03:24:58,495 --> 03:24:59,007
Or

3434
03:24:59,263 --> 03:24:59,775
Maybe

3435
03:25:32,287 --> 03:25:33,055
See how you said that

3436
03:25:33,311 --> 03:25:33,823
Mystery

3437
03:25:34,591 --> 03:25:35,103
Do it down about this

3438
03:25:35,615 --> 03:25:36,127
June 4th

3439
03:25:36,895 --> 03:25:37,407
The new Youth Center

3440
03:25:39,967 --> 03:25:42,015
And I went outside literally like what happened

3441
03:25:44,575 --> 03:25:45,087
Lejeune

3442
03:25:46,367 --> 03:25:47,135
Hearing correct

3443
03:25:53,535 --> 03:25:56,095
Time

3444
03:25:56,607 --> 03:25:57,119
It sounded like

3445
03:25:57,631 --> 03:25:58,911
Do you like maybe you did send them

3446
03:25:59,935 --> 03:26:00,447
We when I just played

3447
03:26:00,959 --> 03:26:04,543
Told me

3448
03:26:04,799 --> 03:26:05,311
Underoath

3449
03:26:05,567 --> 03:26:06,079
That

3450
03:26:06,335 --> 03:26:06,847
You think you

3451
03:26:07,615 --> 03:26:08,127
Stop sending

3452
03:26:08,639 --> 03:26:09,151
You think

3453
03:26:09,919 --> 03:26:11,967
You keep saying

3454
03:26:12,735 --> 03:26:13,503
You showed it to me

3455
03:26:13,759 --> 03:26:15,039
It's there I know at some point

3456
03:26:15,551 --> 03:26:16,831
I told people don't cover this

3457
03:26:17,087 --> 03:26:18,111
I said don't have an audion

3458
03:26:24,767 --> 03:26:30,911
So what there's this interesting dichotomy you can

3459
03:26:31,167 --> 03:26:35,775
Speak definitively about things once they're beautiful

3460
03:26:36,031 --> 03:26:40,383
You know like once you show a video of like I said

3461
03:26:40,895 --> 03:26:44,735
Now you can start talking you can say oh yeah okay I did that

3462
03:26:45,247 --> 03:26:46,527
But until that point

3463
03:26:47,039 --> 03:26:53,183
Anything could be possible I don't remember I don't know it is it is a little bit like

3464
03:26:53,439 --> 03:26:55,487
Alex should stop at some point be like listen

3465
03:26:55,743 --> 03:27:01,887
We can play this game all day I'm going to lie to you you're going to know that I'm lying but I'm going to keep doing it

3466
03:27:02,143 --> 03:27:07,519
Your proof first and then I won't have to lie for 20 minutes we can get out of here boom boom boom

3467
03:27:08,031 --> 03:27:12,127
Get about get it out you know it wouldn't go boom boom.

3468
03:27:12,383 --> 03:27:18,527
We're one more clip here and it's about this video

3469
03:27:18,783 --> 03:27:19,295
Of

3470
03:27:19,551 --> 03:27:20,575
Rob dues uncle

3471
03:27:20,831 --> 03:27:24,415
And Alex

3472
03:27:24,927 --> 03:27:25,695
Cycling

3473
03:27:45,151 --> 03:27:47,967
Is your uncle do

3474
03:27:48,479 --> 03:27:50,527
Uncle

3475
03:28:07,935 --> 03:28:14,079
I really don't know

3476
03:28:19,967 --> 03:28:20,991
That damn it.

3477
03:28:21,503 --> 03:28:24,063
Right on the day that we just watch

3478
03:28:24,575 --> 03:28:25,087
Correct

3479
03:28:25,343 --> 03:28:26,111
Wear the same shirt

3480
03:28:26,367 --> 03:28:31,231
Right

3481
03:28:34,047 --> 03:28:34,559
The same day

3482
03:28:35,839 --> 03:28:36,351
Right

3483
03:28:37,631 --> 03:28:40,191
And the person he was interviewing was robbed

3484
03:28:42,495 --> 03:28:43,007
Now

3485
03:28:43,519 --> 03:28:45,055
You claimed that

3486
03:28:45,567 --> 03:28:46,591
Rob Hughes uncle

3487
03:28:46,847 --> 03:28:47,871
Former FBI agent

3488
03:28:48,639 --> 03:28:50,431
Was investigating Sandy Hook

3489
03:28:50,687 --> 03:28:51,199
Bright

3490
03:28:56,063 --> 03:28:56,575
You said

3491
03:28:57,855 --> 03:28:58,367
NFL

3492
03:28:58,879 --> 03:28:59,647
Was invested

3493
03:29:01,951 --> 03:29:02,975
Former engagement

3494
03:29:05,791 --> 03:29:06,303
My boy

3495
03:29:13,215 --> 03:29:16,031
You just hear he said that. He did a great job

3496
03:29:16,287 --> 03:29:17,567
Female the thing

3497
03:29:19,103 --> 03:29:25,247
Alright well

3498
03:29:25,503 --> 03:29:29,343
Boy that fell apart a little bit for Alex

3499
03:29:29,599 --> 03:29:32,159
So the

3500
03:29:32,415 --> 03:29:38,559
Deposition is at this point basically reached its its endpoint that I wear

3501
03:29:38,815 --> 03:29:41,887
Where we break for the day

3502
03:29:42,143 --> 03:29:45,215
And we come back at another point

3503
03:29:45,471 --> 03:29:47,519
For another round of questions with Alex

3504
03:29:48,031 --> 03:29:50,079
We'll see if you find that Bloomberg email

3505
03:29:50,335 --> 03:29:52,383
I don't think so

3506
03:29:52,639 --> 03:29:55,967
See if he gets any of the things that you promised

3507
03:29:56,223 --> 03:29:59,295
He with the he would produce

3508
03:29:59,551 --> 03:30:04,159
See if he figures out when he's here but Hyundai about these now

3509
03:30:04,415 --> 03:30:05,439
Especially now

3510
03:30:05,695 --> 03:30:06,207
Okay

3511
03:30:06,463 --> 03:30:10,815
Is during these depositions in the past I've been like man

3512
03:30:11,583 --> 03:30:13,119
I hope you guys lose

3513
03:30:13,375 --> 03:30:17,215
A lot of money but now in the future I get to be like dude

3514
03:30:17,471 --> 03:30:23,615
That answer cost you one billion dollars you f****** idiot

3515
03:30:23,871 --> 03:30:30,015
There was part whatever part was a part of a billion

3516
03:30:30,271 --> 03:30:36,415
Is your shity answers for how much they cost you if you're fascinated it would be it would be

3517
03:30:36,671 --> 03:30:39,487
I mean there's been a lot in here there's a lot of

3518
03:30:39,743 --> 03:30:42,303
Kind of new information a lot of

3519
03:30:42,559 --> 03:30:48,703
Retreading of some of the stuff that we've seen before it bursts corsage

3520
03:30:48,959 --> 03:30:49,983
Wild

3521
03:30:50,239 --> 03:30:51,007
Bitters

3522
03:30:51,519 --> 03:30:57,663
Interview I will say I have watched the other days court and

3523
03:30:57,919 --> 03:31:00,479
The second day

3524
03:31:02,015 --> 03:31:02,527
I mean

3525
03:31:03,295 --> 03:31:08,927
It's not disappointing if you're if you're thinking it's going to slow down it's not

3526
03:31:09,183 --> 03:31:15,327
It does feel like it's chaos it does feel like after listening to a day after being in a day

3527
03:31:15,583 --> 03:31:19,679
Give depositions of this you have a night to sleep on it you go out

3528
03:31:19,935 --> 03:31:26,079
You go have dinner with Norm at a shity conversation about whatever Tsarnaev Brothers date

3529
03:31:26,335 --> 03:31:32,479
Meeting his niece now I'll tamerlan's dead

3530
03:31:32,735 --> 03:31:35,039
Why don't you think okay

3531
03:31:36,063 --> 03:31:37,343
Here's what I could do better

3532
03:31:38,623 --> 03:31:44,767
There's no room for improvement honestly Zelda 10/10 perfect job

3533
03:31:45,279 --> 03:31:49,375
Or less painful less painful don't you. Don't you dislike pain

3534
03:31:49,887 --> 03:31:56,031
No because he has that Miracle Juice whiskey

3535
03:31:56,287 --> 03:31:59,615
And that's keeps him a happy and

3536
03:31:59,871 --> 03:32:06,015
Yeah I had a couple of contacts drops that I wanted to play but and I forgot to at the beginning

3537
03:32:06,271 --> 03:32:07,807
They may annoy you in the future okay

3538
03:32:08,063 --> 03:32:08,831
I like damn

3539
03:32:09,087 --> 03:32:11,903

Jordan came up so we're going to have it all the compliments

3542
03:32:23,935 --> 03:32:28,031
Bedtime

3543
03:32:28,287 --> 03:32:34,431
Yeah I do have to take compliments they were meant for badonde but

3544
03:32:34,687 --> 03:32:40,831
Alex was talking s*** about the position removing all of the compliments that Madonna

3545
03:32:41,087 --> 03:32:41,599
Received

3546
03:32:41,855 --> 03:32:46,207
Only to bed but still there

I don't know that you have to share with people

3552
03:33:19,487 --> 03:33:22,815
If you stick through together that is true it's not a scam

3553
03:33:23,327 --> 03:33:27,423
And now here comes with the sex robot

3554
03:33:29,471 --> 03:33:33,311
Alexandra Thurston color
