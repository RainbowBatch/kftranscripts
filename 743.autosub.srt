00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,344
Knowledge party.com respect with knowledge fight

3
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,744
Sick of them posing as if they're the good guys or the bad guys

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,144
MoneyGram

5
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:58,880
Dot-com

6
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,328
What about Alex Jones

7
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:10,912
Indeed we are Dan

8
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:14,752
Today is Ojos a week it's been

9
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:20,384
Encapsulating a bunch of stuff

10
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,784
So we recorded the formulaic objections episode about Alex's deposition

11
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,832
On Saturday earlier than you

12
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:35,232
Right we usually record on Sunday and honestly it was sort of my intention to do that on Mondays show

13
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,280
And then the rest of the deposition stuff on

14
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,048
On Friday

15
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,840
Which would be this episode but

16
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,376
We'll get to that inside of course

17
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:47,776
I'll but the reason we recorded today early was because I was very kindly invited to give a lecture

18
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:51,616
The University of Kansas and Lawrence by Professor Colin

19
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:56,992
And boy what a weird f****** turn of events

20
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:03,392
I didn't want to talk about it on the show itself Chad made a post about it in the Facebook group chat but didn't want to mention it on the

21
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,160
The show itself

22
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,184
Just for the sake of life

23
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,232
Respecting the purity of

24
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,512
Skyblue academic

25
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,048
Settings

26
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,840
The possibility of a bunch of people

27
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,144
To show up in like treated like a live show

28
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,496
Disrespectful to the students and the professor

29
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:21,824
Nice way of saying you despise the unwashed masses

30
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,384
It's a little

31
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,784
But Christie showed up

32
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,392
Very nice

33
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,160
So hey

34
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:36,928
Hurrah

35
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:43,328
Good news it was a great time I was nice I like Lawrence quite a

36
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,096
Call Voice

37
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:49,216
Shouldn't because I went to the University of Missouri is our mortal enemy course

38
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:53,312
I'm not supposed to like that sounded like did cnwk there want fry

39
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:59,712
I was so atmosphere there once despised another

40
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:06,112
College sometimes and I would get drunk it was really fun to yell

41
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:09,440
Am i z like I kind of stopped

42
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:15,840
Of course you know you're not doing it by yourself in your room it's like a call Andrew

43
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:22,240
Response for people yay Cubs game what a Cubs playoff game the last one

44
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:28,640
Wrapped up in the Go Cubs Go

45
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:35,040
The song with everybody everybody with people

46
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,576
Is it the whole thing

47
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,624
Quite quite a Time

48
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,904
So I'm not

49
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,208
Necessarily the best

50
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,024
Lecturer

51
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,304
I've never done this

52
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,984
Positive reviews from the folks who were there my parents came Christy was there

53
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,592
And the professor all had very nice things to say until I I'll take their word for it but

54
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,640
I'm not in not as fluid

55
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,176
Not then.

56
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,456
There's something

57
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:06,272
In that setting where you it's really nice when they're you can

58
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:11,136
Think the lecturers having a good time and definitely did not see that

59
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,184
I was scared of these 18 year olds

60
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:21,631
Text you about this and it's like it's in your bones as somebody who does stand up or is that time

61
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,935
You're Expecting The response of laughter

62
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,751
Even when you know that that's not the right

63
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,311
Another item Avenue

64
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,383
I'd say things and get almost no response

65
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:38,527
Dead eyes look real

66
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,575
You couldn't help but feel like kind of

67
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,879
Weird in that same way

68
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:47,231
Although High Point probably was when

69
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,535
They have these high-tech desks

70
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:53,631
And likes it that there's a TV built into the desk that comes up

71
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:59,007
Damn out of the desk yeah and one of them got triggered somehow and it just started coming up

72
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,615
And I got a vector that goes. The robot test

73
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,639
That's what I was fun

74
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,503
Albenza nighttime got to spend some time with my parents

75
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:13,855
I was just thinking when we probably about what

76
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,671
At 6 or so years ago when we were

77
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,439
Drunk at like

78
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:21,535
3 a.m. arguing about the finer points of Andy Daly's career

79
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,071
I was like you know whatever

80
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:28,447
2 hours earlier you would said I have to go do my, no no no no

81
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,031
That's going to be electors of day

82
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:37,407
Yes here we are a lot of people had wanted

83
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:41,503
A recording of the the lecture itself and

84
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,295
We were we were trying to do that

85
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,111
I think was a little bit

86
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:46,879
Out-of-pocket

87
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:50,463
So I'm not sure if there will be a recording of it

88
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:54,047
Best case scenario don't record your first one and put that

89
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,351
I recorded the audio on my phone but

90
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:02,751
But it's not good but that's how you work on yourself buddy medley

91
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,871
Sunday and lectures on Monday and then Tuesday morning

92
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,639
I flew back

93
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,687
A lot

94
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,759
That's a genius

95
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,319
Itrip

96
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:22,463
Yeah there was not had the pleasure of being on an airplane when there was trouble

97
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,255
Not in the air

98
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,279
But like

99
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,095
We were delayed for about an hour I can way there

100
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,399
And they were so cryptic about it there like

101
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,959
There's something in the wing and Deli

102
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,871
Thankfully I was so tired that I just left through the delay anyway

103
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,407
Whatever

104
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,431
Oh that's great

105
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:47,039
And it was a delightful time and thank you so much to call in for your invite me out there

106
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,343
And

107
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:54,463
Validating in a way of like a hey you know we're doing something and it means something in a

108
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:59,839
Environment that I respect a lot the Academia

109
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:04,703
0 not one I've been like how do you throw a pie can you give a lecture on this

110
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:11,103
Is there a podcast assholes School

111
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,639
Necessary

112
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,431
A good time

113
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,015
And then on the way back

114
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,319
It turns out I get home

115
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,879
And my computer broke of course

116
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,927
Electric keyboard

117
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:31,327
What does trying to fix it and I ended up breaking it even more needed to get a new laptop and

118
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,631
Adjusting to that

119
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,423
Whole lot of hassle

120
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:41,311
You don't hear the f****** thing I we have flown a little bit

121
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,103
For various things

122
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:47,199
In this time also at that into it there has never been

123
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,503
A single leg of one of my trips

124
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,903
Where I didn't have a flyer in my bag that's at the TSA look through it opened it up every single time I think

125
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:02,303
It might be because of like Electronics or you think of that I blame the TSA in their abolition

126
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,095
Now because they messed up my computer

127
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,679
I mean one of them calling for their abolition for years

128
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,215
So glad you're on board

129
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,751
+ 2

130
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:17,151
You cannot fly in 2022 without losing something or breaking something Wild

131
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:17,919
She lost stuff

132
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,991
Whenever we were traveling I lost stuff it's a whole mess

133
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,271
Yeah yeah

134
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,551

You know here we are now

137
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,159
The issue is

138
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:33,279
What are reported on Saturday with this expectation that like Alex has been out of Studio forever

139
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,583
So the idea was we do the deposition on Monday

140
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
Comeback

141
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,375

Well Permanent Vacation meanwhile Alex comes back on

00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,151

Absolutely spectacular world you don't want to use a bunch of cheaters

You do like the last game two nights ago

00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:22,943
Schwarber Harper the Hopkinsville went on a home run parade

153

You don't know rock references prefer if he were still on the road The Rock

167
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,615

Oh no that's too long yeah that's bad

Alex did a three-and-a-half-hour show

181
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,607
It was mostly pre-recorded with some gas tonight

182
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
Really

183
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:23,263
But forget to say hello to some new

184
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,847
The worst happy birthday Evan live thank you so much and I'll policy wonk

185
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,991
You are now a policy wonk

186
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:39,647
Thank you very much I almost read incorrectly but I did not

187
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,815
Thank you very much

188
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:50,399
Little boo squid thank you so much you and I hope all is well

189
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:57,055
Thank you very much

190
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:01,919
The one that I almost read as Kurt quesadilla but that is not correct

191
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,687
But I'm not

192
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:06,271
His last name so much

193
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,319
You are now

194
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:13,951
Don't get mad until you're brilliant someone

195
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,231
Sodomites

196
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,751
I don't want

197
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,543
Jesus Christ

198
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,127
Quetzalcoatl

199
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:38,527
Without the ancient god of the Mayans I feel like anytime I see a

200
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:44,927
Q and then more than like 3 letters in trouble

201
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,463
Is difficult that is fair

202
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,023
But here we are

203
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,303
Alex came back

204
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,839
The very next day

205
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:56,959
Sorry Alex came back on Saturday and did his nonsense

206
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,495
And here's the thing man

207
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,287
It's a bummer because

208
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:03,871
Used golf cart while Emily comes back as if nothing happened

209
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:10,271
Annie just like a lot of work keishin

210
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:13,599
Music of billion dollars be like all right

211
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:19,999
Head down let's just get back to work but he does do this a bit I don't know I feel like we see him a lot of time

212
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:24,095
Times of things are bad it's like wild

213
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:30,751
So I don't really know what he was up to or what he was doing but I would assume it was taken care of

214
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,775
Of some

215
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,823
Numerous legal matters

216
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,103
Yeah I would argue that

217
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
But

218
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,407
Things happened in the world

219
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:40,735
Imallexx cannot stay away for long absolutely not what happened

220
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:47,135
Let's say when someone breaks into Nancy Pelosi's house

221
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,463
So he decided to cover the story early

222
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,743
And sensational

223
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,047
Pelosi

224
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:54,815
Husband

225
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,119
Being attacked

226
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
With a hammer

227
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,799
But now we have the audio of plans at the moment

228
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,847
The 911 calls

229
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,895
Police dispatch

230
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,455
Paul Pelosi said he doesn't know

231
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,991
Who's a male is

232
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,831
But he advised that his name is David and he is a friend

233
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,159
Thunder where they were naked

234
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,975
Just a broken inside.

235
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
Broken into

236
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,327
Very

237
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,119
Going on there

238
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:29,887
With

239
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,679
For hair

240
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
Losi

241
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,775
Getting into all

242
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311
That here

243
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:43,711
Today or why not

244
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,527
Being pretty on top of the Pelosi

245
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:50,367
Conspiracy theories and also not surprising to see him lying about the situation

246
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:57,023
He doesn't have the audio of the 911 call that's just entirely made up and he's basing his reporting on faulty get some

247
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,095
Thompson said he just saw him memes are I'm dumb blogs

248
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:05,983
In reality Pelosi was the victim of a home invasion and the person was holding him hostage with a hammer

249
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,079
David was really more

250
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:10,847
Interested in his

251
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:17,247
Mr. Pelosi was able to convince the guy to let him use the bathroom where his phone was charging anybody to call to police

252
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:21,599
Being careful to speak in language that wouldn't set off alarms for the guy with a hammer

253
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:28,255
Lucy did convey to 9/11 that the guy's name was David specifically that the guy had said that his name

254
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,023
When was David

255
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,143
He also was clear that he didn't know who he was and that he planned to wait there for his wife to arrive

256
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:38,495
Just after police arrived David hit Pelosi with the hammer and was arrest

257
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:42,847
In the ambulance Pelosi told officer Aryan Starks that he quote

258
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,383
I had never seen to pay

259
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,151
Before

260
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,199
The glass was not broken outward

261
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,479
A witness who was working

262
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,759
Security at the

263
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,319
Neighboring address nearby house

264
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:58,463
Stock quote an individual an all-black carrying a large black bag on his back walking near the Pelosi resume

265
00:15:59,487 --> 00:15:59,999
He quote

266
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,327
Then heard what sounded like banging on either a door or car

267
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,423
Also any post-arrest interview to PayPal admitted that he quote

268
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,727
Broke into the house through a glass door

269
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:13,055
Which was a difficult task that required the use of a hammer

270
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:19,455
The interview is consistent with Pelosi's version of events in that they didn't know each other and that the

271
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,527
Play Pet arrived broken in and demanded to know where Nancy was

272
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:26,623
Made it clearer to police that he wanted to hold her hostage

273
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,439
And that if she lied to him he would break her kneecaps

274
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,487
So she would have to be quote

275
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:35,071
Wheeled into Congress which would show other members of Congress

276
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,375
There were consequences to actions

277
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,679
It's clear from his admission

278
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,959
Police from Zack

279
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,983
Tenzin from his writing

280
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,007
Prior to the attack

281
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,055
The David depaepe is a far-right

282
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:50,431
Extremists who was at best attempting to hold the Speaker of the House hostage and maim her

283
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:56,319
Very obvious why people across the right-wing media ecosystem from Alex to Matt Walsh

284
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:59,391
Glenn Greenwald have tried to run interference on this story

285
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,463
Handcrafted different narrative out of it and that's because

286
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,535
It's a direct result of their ideology and rhetoric

287
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,559
They know that

288
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,583
And they welcome

289
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,375
But in order to keep the business running

290
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,191
It's key to disown your children once they take action

291
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:12,959
That's all

292
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,727
What's going on here

293
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,311
Repetitive we've seen this a million times

294
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:21,919
Yeah yeah it's a good thing though that when we see this happen no one doesn't it

295
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:28,319
Nothing about it I appreciate that the most because I would be I would be really sad if this didn't continue to happen forever and ever and ever

296
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,343
You know

297
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,159
Bummer if somebody

298
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,351
Anything about it which is amazing

299
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,399
It's stuff I mean the maze

300
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:46,239
On what hand I kind of agree and I feel your laments

301
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,031
On the other hand

302
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:51,359
I'm not really fully certain I know what can be done

303
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:57,759
I don't know what should be done necessarily it's a good thing that nobody has ever put out say a list

304
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,807
People for whom this type of Acts

305
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,831
Action would be volume

306
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:04,159
You know it's that it's good thing nobody's ever been like hey

307
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:07,487
Here's what's a hit list of some sort

308
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:13,887
You know of the people that need to be taken care of you know it's a good thing to someone like Alex is never a note old people

309
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:20,287
Go to make a list of globalist in their town could take care of if need be

310
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,847
Yeah it's a sign of

311
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,639
It's an escalation

312
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,735
It feels like very fascinated by this dude's plan

313
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,527
That's what fascinates me most about

314
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,295
This whole thing

315
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,575
How does this

316
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,343
How does he

317
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,623
Think this goes

318
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,391
If it goes

319
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
Tabaxi

320
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,439
Well I think

321
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,463
Think you understood

322
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:46,143
To whatever extent you could that it wasn't going to go good

323
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:52,543
Innocent the end result was probably going to be him in prison

324
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:57,919
But on the way there he could maybe Nancy Pelosi in a way that would send a message to the rest

325
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:05,343
I get I'm just fascinated by that idea of like this is what I'm going to do you know

326
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,159
It's just a weird thing I'm going to go I'm going to go

327
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,207
To the speaker of the house is home

328
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,231
With a hammer

329
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:17,631
Right

330
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,423
Switch audio

331
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,191
Something else

332
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,727
Here is

333
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,543
The audio the supposedly article

334
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,079
Dot-com

335
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,359
Police dispatch Paul

336
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,895
Pelosi said he doesn't know

337
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,687
Who's the male is

338
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,783
He advised that his name is David and he is a

339
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,319
Friend here that

340
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,671
849

341
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,463
Broadway Across

342
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,231
Scott

343
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,335
Friend

344
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,407
Colormax

345
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,015
His name is David

346
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,063
And he's a friend but he doesn't know

347
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,111
He is

348
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:15,743
This isn't a 911 call this is a dispatcher relaying the information from a 911 call

349
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:20,095
Also there's a very clear pronoun reference issue here that is at the heart of

350
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:26,495
What does dispatcher is saying is that Pelosi doesn't know who the person is but the person had said that his name is David

351
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,031
And that he is a friend

352
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:34,687
He wasn't saying that Pelosi considers this guy friend he saying the Pelosi saying that David told him he was a friend

353
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:41,599
It's about as simple as an explanation is that but Alex has to grass but whatever straws are there to pretend that this is some

354
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,391
I'm kind of fake thing as opposed to

355
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,951
Exact logical conclusion of his worldview

356
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,999
And I don't know

357
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,023
Mary r

358
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,559
I mean dates

359
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,375
It's really kind of simple

360
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
Direct

361
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:58,751
You can draw a one-to-one line from stochastic terrorism to terrorism

362
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,543
Really easy

363
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,567
No no no no

364
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,591
Israel considered

365
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,455
Also won't somebody think of Rand Paul

366
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,247
Well I guess a dude would look

367
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,623
Anybody gay

368
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,647
Thanks

369
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,416
What

370
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,696
Azhar trying to

371
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,464
Saddle

372
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,000
Wayne

373
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,024
The American

374
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,328
Right now

375
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,144
Flying Mustang

376
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:30,240
Voters are calling it a new

377
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,776
January 6th

378
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,544
Gets worse

379
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,104
Sugar

380
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,128
6 ribs broken

381
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,432
One punctured

382
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,736
Serious health problems because

383
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,528
Celebrate

384
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,136
Speedy recovery and sayings

385
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:47,904
Violence

386
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,184
Did not happen

387
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,256
Called him a little b****

388
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:56,864
The last is apparently Rex Chapman on Twitter I guess that's

389
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:04,288
So is this constitutes a false flag than the term is entirely lost its meaning it's just a meaningless

390
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,080
Catchphrase for Alex to throw out to pop the

391
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:10,176
The crowd let's get her done at this point just beans

392
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:14,528
A ramp all that wasn't a politically-motivated attack at all

393
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:17,856
He got into a fight with his neighbor Rene Boucher about yard weigh

394
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,928
ABC News article about boucher's Trial

395
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:21,696
Quote

396
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:25,536
Federal prosecutors said Boucher had enough after he Witness

397
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:28,608
Paul stack brush into a pile on his own lawn

398
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,656
But near boucher's property

399
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:33,728
Event ran onto Falls property and tackled him

400
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,128
These are comfortable situations at all and all Alex's doing is playing a distraction game but who would you think of for Rand Paul

401
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,784
Rex Chapman said something mean about him struggling again

402
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,320
I'm having a trouble with

403
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,112
Man that neighbor

404
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,648
Could just tackle him

405
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:58,304
What are you doing what are you doing going in her house with a hammer just wait until she's outside of intact

406
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,632
It is what it is

407
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:05,216
Why are there so many elaborate plans whatever if you're just his neighbor

408
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,240
You can be like hey

409
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:12,896
Those sticks are too close to my yard

410
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:20,320
It is a it is a shocking lack of like functional security you're not wrong about that

411
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,624
It's a little upset

412
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:29,024
News topic that we are all used to hearing about

413
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,352
You know once an episode Maybe

414
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:37,728
Of course something is really severe and that it's not it's the covid - of the day

415
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,264
Define that

416
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,152
Daniel

417
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:51,552
H e r

418
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,816
We reach the covid-19

419
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:05,888
It's over

420
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:10,496
Meanwhile flu they said was gone for 2 years every kind of that is covered

421
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,104
Is more severe than has been in 13 years

422
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,688
And they're calling it

423
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,480
The flu

424
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:27,392
The flu wasn't gone. It was just that when Alex was starting to get really going with his covid death conspiracy theory

425
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:32,256
Flu season was ending so he made a really big deal out of heaven

426
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,560
The CDC was going to stop monitoring flu deaths

427
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:40,192
He settled on that as a fake explanation for that things back then and he hasn't thought about it since

428
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:42,496
Hey just hasn't updated talking points

429
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:48,896
Even so in the 2021 flu season it was estimated that the flu resulted in between 8 and

430
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:52,736
13 million cases in between 5,000 and 14000 deaths

431
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:56,576
Who was relatively mild as was the 2020 season

432
00:24:56,832 --> 00:25:01,440
Most likely because of the broad adoption of covid mitigation strategies like social distancing

433
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,208
And wearing masks

434
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,536
People seem to decide that she does all done with

435
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:08,352
So whatever benefit was bringing about is gone

436
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:12,704
One variable data likely unrelated to human behavior patterns is that

437
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,008
The flu is coming early this year

438
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:19,616
And it looks like this year the H3 and two strained it spreading is

439
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,640
Fairly severe

440
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:27,296
That's unlucky partially because about 26 million less people have gotten the flu vaccine than did in 2020

441
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,088
Which conceivably could be a

442
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:33,440
At least in part attributed to the meteoric rise of anti-vaxxers rhetoric

443
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,488
And belief in the intervening years

444
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,768
Pushed by folks

445
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,536
Like Alex

446
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:44,704
Much of the influence that Alex and his ilk were put into the world have contributed to the pretty bleak situation we see in front of us

447
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,984
In terms of flu

448
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,872
But naturally when things get bad it'll just be reported to the audience as evidence that he was right all along

449
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:57,504
Because he just gets to claim the flu deaths are secretly covid vaccine deaths without proving it in anyway

450
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,784
And there we go

451
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,600
Nothing is real

452
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,672
Yeah I I really do appreciate

453
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,696
Everyone

454
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:11,328
Staunch refusal to learn the most obvious and enduring lesson of all-time which is that

455
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,424
There will be unintended consequences of all of this b*******

456
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:20,032
And by the covid-19 whatever-it-is level of

457
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,824
Quote we're done with it

458
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,104
As there may be

459
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,384
Beer

460
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,968
Reverberations of the behaviors during that time. Are going

461
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,760
Need to be paid for it

462
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:33,600
Decades like we're in serious situation

463
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:36,672
Yep the unwillingness of people to take Public Health

464
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,208
Situation seriously

465
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,744
Erosion of

466
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,768
I'm sort of public

467
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:45,632
Lacrosse there's no trust in any governmental like respond in any way to

468
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:53,056
Good luck use an individual solutions to solve population-level problems

469
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,848
It's not going to work nope

470
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,408
So

471
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,968
Alex interview some people and I don't care

472
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,760
When was Rodger Stone

473
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,528
I don't care

474
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,576
But

475
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,600
Before we get out of

476
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,672
Saturday's episode October 29th

477
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,696
That episode

478
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,768
We have a tortured metaphor

479
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,328
That's three and a half minutes long now

480
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120
Alex is talking about Elon Musk

481
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:23,520
Call God know he starts thinking about that you judge a man by the fruit

482
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:28,384
And then he starts talking about literal trees and fruit

483
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,784
Open boy does this go on scribed the worst thing in history a tortured metaphor from Alex

484
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,368
Almost 4 Minutes about Elon Musk it said so

485
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:41,952
Take it the history of the world yeah he should have taken another day off

486
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:42,976
Getting back

487
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,256
Elon Musk

488
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:47,840
Are you looking at

489
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,864
Tree by what

490
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,168
You know IU

491
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:53,984
9 Acres

492
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,312
On the Barton Creek

493
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,104
And we had a cup

494
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,408
7 Acres

495
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,200
Upholstery

496
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:04,736
Add an apple

497
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:06,528
Aplomb

498
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:12,928
And

499
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:15,232
We could get more apples and

500
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,048
A

501
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,608
Then we could every

502
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,168
Off of that

503
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,704
7 Acres

504
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,336
Caribou

505
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:32,640
Are all the time

506
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,200
Still weather at the creek

507
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,760
Milwaukee water I drive

Apples

511
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,208
Plums

512
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,096
You cannot be serious

513
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,008
Tree

514
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,104
But it would have twice as many

515
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,872
Plums

516
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,200
Rap

517
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,832
But it would have almost nothing on

518
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,952
About what

519
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,768

Motor with app

521
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,144
Went down to the ground

How to make an apple pie

525
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,688
Is it story about

526
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,968
Stealing

527
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,064
Big blunt

528
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,136
Whole bunch

529
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,536
Also loaded

530
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,376
Oh it's not

531
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,144
People ask me

532
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,704
What I think

533
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,728
Elon Musk

534
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,752
And I'm

535
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,288
I try to be christ-like

536
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,568
Complain to be

537
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,848
Merry Chrysler

538
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,944
Someone hit him with 100 apples

539
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,224
And my Saviour but

540
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,272
Let's just say this crisis never wrong

541

Black

542
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,856
Am I thinking Christ that isn't from America

543
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,136
Be very clear

544
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,928
What Christ said

545
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,976
You judge a tree by its fruit

546
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,840
And the things he's done

547
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,888
Thoroughly

548
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,424
Starlink

549
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,984
That kind of waves down him being a good guy

550
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,008
Side of that

551
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:40,128
But then you look at coming out against the vaccine two years ago and sing.

552
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,712
Coming out against world government

553
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,248
Not coming on again

554
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,016
Ukraine war

555
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,552
Not coming out against sensor

556
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:51,648
Nelson we should get rid of fossil fuels are good thing we need them

557
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,440
Alongside Electric

558
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,976
Develop better systems

559
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:57,280
We will collapse we don't have it

560
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,584
And just on and on and on

561
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,352
I look at the

562
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,120
Tree

563
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,144
Does Elon Musk

564
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,424
And I say

565
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:04,960
This guy's

566
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,984
Getting better and better

567
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,544
The good side of him way out

568
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:15,968
Bad don't worry you're going to end up liking him he was an apartheid property or his family is

569
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,248
I do.

570
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:23,648
Space backgrounds here you'll be fine you'll like him I don't I don't quite know what to do when anybody brings

571
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,696
Elon Musk without being like

572
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:31,328
What needs to happen is the entire population of the earth needs to jump upon him and tear him limb from limb

573
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,376
Like there's not much other things

574
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:38,752
Things to say about him or you needs to stack brush to close to Renee boshears yard

575
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,520
Yes

576
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:44,896
Trick people in a rush to close to his yard

577
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:51,040
So as usual Alex is completely misunderstood the Bible verse he claims that he bases a lot of his thinking around

578
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,320
There are tumors

579
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,880
Studies reference in here with the fruit in the trees

580
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:58,464
One of them is Luke 643 through 45

581
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,232
Good size quilt

582
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:01,280
For a good tree does not bear bad

583
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,328
Nor does a bad tree bear good for

584
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,888
For every tree is known by its own fruit

585
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,448
For men do not gather figs from thorn

586
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:11,008
Friends nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush

587
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:17,664
A good man out of the good Treasure of his heart brings forth good and an evil man out of the evil Treasure of his heart brings forth

588
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:22,272
Similar passages found in Matthew 7:15 through 20

589
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:27,904
Quote beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves

590
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,952
You will know them by their fruits

591
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:33,792
Do men gather grapes from Thorn bushes or figs from thistles

592
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:36,864
Even so every good tree Bears good fruit

593
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,680
But a bad tree Bears Bad fruit

594
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:42,240
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit

595
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,544
Nor can a battery bear good fruit

596
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:49,408
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire

597
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:51,712
Therefore by their fruits you will know them

598
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,368
Disappears in both Luke and Matthew because both those gospels are largely believed to have been derived from a common source

599
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,256
That's a really complicated matter so to stick to the simple stuff Alex has no idea what these verses mean apparently

600
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:08,608
Even in this long Meandering Plum and apple story that he's telling

601
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:12,960
Alex offers two different interpretations of how you can tell a tree by its fruit

602
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,496
And they're both wrong

603
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,288
Remember what the Bible says

604
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,872
The first super science is that you can tell how good a tree is

605
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:23,456
Not by a how big it is but by the amount of fruit it produces

606
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:27,808
There's a fun way to think about plants but it's not related to that scripture at all

607
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:34,464
The second version Alex comes up with his that you weigh the good fruit against the bad fruit in order to determine if a tree is good or bad

608
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,536
That's also not with the pipe

609
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:42,400
The real problem with his Bible verse is that it exposes an absolute that humans

610
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,680
Can't really live up to

611
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,984
Good trees produce good fruit

612
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,384
Bad trees produce bad fruit no good tree produces bad fruit and no bad tree produces good fruit therefore

613
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,688
If you produce bad fruit your bad tree and it

614
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,480
If you produce good fruit you're a good tree

615
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:02,880
Yeah there's a reason that people like to think of it in a different way because the other way of thinking about it give me the more

616
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,672
Accurate way of thinking about it it's hard

617
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,696
Is a

618
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,976
Predestination

619
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,512
In this actual context

620
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:14,912
The verse is really unhelpful to Alex because it would require him to put definitely Abel's on people with your rigid and cannot be chained

621
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,752
How's can't work in that environment because he needs to be able to shift

622
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:23,360
The allegiances of his imaginary allies and enemies depending on what headlines

623
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:29,760
He needs to respond to and if they're determined to be unwaveringly good or bad it hurts his ability to make s*** up

624
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:30,784
Up as it goes along

625
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:37,440
This is all very stupid and illustrates how Alex's understanding of his holy text is really just surface-level and mostly based on

626
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,232
Catchphrases he doesn't really grass

627
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:45,888
And naturally this is all really just a ramp up for Alex to explain that he'll determine whether or not Elon Musk

628
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,168
Is a good tree based on

629
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:49,728
Whether or not he lets Alex back on Twitter

630
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:51,264
It's really what Jesus was talking to

631
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:59,456
It is it is just impossible for him to understand the Bible in any other interpretation than

632
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,224
Capitalist

633
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,760
Like because the gun

634
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,576
It's not about the type of fruit really

635
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:07,136
This small trees got 100 fruit Snowman

636
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:12,256
That's better than the bigger that's a good trait you know that's a good trait so you sell those f******

637
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:16,864
A plum tree that has like 100 Proof

638
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,888
Bright

639
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,192
30 of them might be good 70 bed

640
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:26,592
30/30 compared to a tree that puts out like 25

641
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:32,736
You're all good but that's only 25 points invested the bigger tricks

642
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:39,136
See this is what Jesus was talking about he's really describing an IPO for fruit orchards

643
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:43,488
Like forbidden books of the Bible this is what it gets into

644
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,768
Yankton to like

645
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:47,584
Real calculus about fruits

646
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:51,424
Anyway I decided to punt covering your ass today

647
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,752
And move on to Sunday when Alex's maybe in

648
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,056
Finer form

649
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:02,176
Yeah it's sort of in midseason form

650
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:06,272
Here's where we start off on Sunday I was wrong

651
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,832
I was already planning today

652
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,928
Sunday broadcast

653
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:21,376
Why there's a war on children and why the real currency

654
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,960
Global Elite in their minions

655
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:25,984
Is hurting

656
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:28,800
And then

657
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,896
3 hours ago

658
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:34,688
I saw

659
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,968
Clip of Laura Logan

660
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,760
Famous investigator

661
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,112
Coming out

662
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,744
Why they target children

663
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,048
The.

664
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,584
That's really what it's all about

665
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:52,864
And they're giving me

666
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,424
Basically evil reward by the God of this world

667
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,728
What they do

668
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:04,384
I'm not sure if the problem people had with Laura Logan was that you said there's a war on children and it's done is an affront to God

669
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:11,296
The kind of commentary probably would preclude her from being on a network that's trying to do serious work but she was on Newsmax

670
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,320
It's not a big deal there

671
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:17,184
Her comments were so inappropriate that Newsmax had to put out a statement saying they wouldn't

672
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,720
Interviewer again

673
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,768
Do the guests on Eric Bolling show.

674
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,536
Be safe quote

675
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,096
They may think that they're going to become gods

676
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:27,680
That's what they tell us you know the ones who want us eating insects

677
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,704
Cockroaches

678
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,568
That while they dine on the blood of our children

679
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,872
Those are the people right

680
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,896
They're not going to win

681
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:43,040
The Logan's blood libel Laden qanon rant was just another step on her past-due full-on publican

682
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,064
Conspiracy lunatic

683
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,112
And a lot of people have this notion that

684
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,904
She's fallen so far

685
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:54,560
She was formerly the chief Foreign Affairs correspondent at CBS News which is a lofty position compared to someone

686
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:58,144
No longer welcome on Newsmax but the reality is she

687
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,168
Already fallen

688
00:37:59,424 --> 00:37:59,936
Grace

689
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:05,568
She was put on leave of absence by CBS in 2013 after an internal investigation

690
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:08,896
Confounded her reporting on Benghazi was fraudulent and that quote

691
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:11,200
Key elements of the story were untrue

692
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:16,576
Reporting relied heavily on a story told by a contractor named Dylan Davies who was lying

693
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:23,488
Stevie spawn story about how he got into combat during the attack and he'd seen Ambassador Stevens body but

694
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:29,632
Unfortunately he pooped already told the FBI that he never left the Villa that evening and that he hadn't put on the scene it

695
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,400
Ouch

696
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,704
Logan did not follow up on

697
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,288
Details of Davy story that would have indicated credibility problems

698
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,568
She also failed

699
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:42,432
Disclosed that he had a book deal selling his fraudulent story about what he did during the attack

700
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,480
Only problem

701
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:51,392
It was shity work and it's not the kind of mistake you would think would be made by someone who is otherwise good at their job he would say

702
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:57,792
First-time mistake it's very sloppy maybe the simplest thing about an interview is to

703
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:00,096
Like hey you know what

704
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:03,424
There's an FBI interview to I'm going to go check that

705
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,192
Real quick

706
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,752
Cross-reference it with the b******* you're saying to

707
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:13,408
Yeah even if you're not it's like even if you don't have the FBI interview available to get his other things we could do to like triangle

708
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,688
Robbery details

709
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:19,040
And be like hey is this guy just trying to get promotion for his book

710
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,832
No it's kind of like what

711
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:27,232
Just off the top of my head somebody like Alex might do is interview somebody who's completely

712
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:32,096
Lying about their kordelya inflating it and then putting it out on TV I can pretty well you likes

713
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:35,424
In the past few years has become just another raving nut

714
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,984
Adelaide spread nonsense on conservative platform

715
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:44,384
If you had a show on Fox Nation but was fired earlier this year and now she's rambling locution blood libel with Eric Bolling

716
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,176
And getting the boot from Newsmax

717
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:50,016
What I'm saying is that he's a prime candidate for Alex to hire

718
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:52,320
I think it makes total sense for him to come to her defense

719
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:56,672
She's unwelcome anywhere else and Alex could really use anybody with a little Holly

720
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:00,512
Totally thank you haven't Harrison Smith host everything and

721
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,816
Another workation

722
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,352
Got to get somebody in there

723
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:10,752
It's just like I wish it would be so much it's so simple to cuz it's just like hey do you know why they're number one finger

724
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:11,776
Is attacking children

725
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:16,640
Because if I tell you that then maybe it'll override your emotional Center long enough

726
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,664
That you won't think

727
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:24,064
For two seconds and realize that I'm full of s*** I want to drink a lot of money

728
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:24,832
Children

729
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,416
But Alex is covering

730
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,976
Shocking if true

731
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,512
But also not true

732
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,888
Somewhere around the 15th

733
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,424
November

734
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,216
Call diesel

735
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,752
All these days

736
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:47,104
All diesel reserves in all diesel gone

737
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,272
Call diesel

738
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:57,600
Sounds like

739
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,256
Over a week ago

740
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,584
17 days

741
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:12,960
November

742
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,240
Right after the

743
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,824
Oh my god there it is

744
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:24,224
Susan stupid we're not going to run out of diesel fuel Alex just up Tucker tweet something that was incorrect and I was

745
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,040
Reporting on that tweet as if he's looked into the story at all

746
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:32,928
The comments that were made as if there's a 25 day supply of diesel fuel in the country which was to say

747
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:37,280
All production were to stop immediately it would run out in 25 days

748
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:43,936
The thing is a production didn't stop and it isn't stopping so there's no date where the fuel is just going to be magically gone

749
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:50,080
An economics professor explained to CBS news that we generally have a supply that would last about 35

750
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:53,919
40 days out but there's a tightening of supply and an increase of demand

751
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,967
It's slightly lowering that window

752
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,271
But it'll adjust back eventually

753
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:02,879
Good mornings with diesel isn't running out this is just a dumb lie Alex's using pescaraz listener

754
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,671
Also let's be clear

755
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:11,071
If we have an impending day that was less than a month that where we be entirely out of diesel fuel and we had no planned and play

756
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,607
Place to adapt to that that would be a

757
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,375
Catastrophe

758
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:16,703
Most of our Trucking delivery folks rely on it to bring

759
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,983
Food around the country among

760
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:20,287
Countless other Goods that need to be transported

761
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:23,615
If these trucks all simultaneously became a mobile

762
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:26,687
It's difficult to an estimate the amount of death that could result in

763
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,479
Unsinkable

764
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:30,015
If that were the case

765
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:32,831
That would be the only thing

766
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,879
Anyone was talking about

767
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,671
Everybody going to be like okay

768
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,975
Just real quick so everybody knows

769
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:45,375
In three weeks we will starve to death in 3 weeks we will have no trucks

770
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,655
We will all die

771
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:53,055
If Alex believe this for a second he would be freaking the f*** out and not just reporting this as some kind of weird conspiracy

772
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:59,455
Me about the election

773
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:05,855
Doesn't stick around unless you give them a reason to be scared so we just tosses this b******* on the pile

774
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:06,879
Knowing it means nothing

775
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,415
This is ridiculous

776
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:13,791
Is it the show is so dumb that is absolutely just like

777
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:17,119
Hey here's a story that's kind of gone unreported the Midwest

778
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,655
Won't have court next week

779
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:20,447
Like no I'm sorry

780
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:22,495
That would not go unreported

781
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:28,895
Your story that everybody is a missing out on a giant meteor about to hit Earth and we can all see

782
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:33,247
Okay let's not feel too many movie plots

783
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:37,087
So the story that is on everybody's mind of course

784
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,135
Pelosi

785
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,671
We got touch back on this one

786
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,975
Voltage in Tupelo

787
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:43,743
Husband

788
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,047
911 tape

789
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,327
Still.

790
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,655
Underwear

791
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,447
The police holding up till today

792
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,007
Call on Friday

793
00:43:59,359 --> 00:43:59,871
Police release

794
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:01,919
The fact that

795
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:02,943
Pelosi

796
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,319
From a nudist colony

797
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,343
Not right winger

798
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,647
A dram

799
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,695
Baltimore underwear

800
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:14,463
With ham

801
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,511
Someone else

802
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,263
Herewith

803
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,287
And my friend

804
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,615
He's attacked

805
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,039
Years old

806
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,231
Sounds fun

807
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,791
Call this the new January 6th

808
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,375
Incredibly

809
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,167
Exactly

810
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,007
Watch Friday

811
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,615
News 2

812
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:04,895
Drunk

813
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:08,479
Flames

814
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:13,343
Amazing so I love the idea that there's that

815
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,439
Two dudes naked with a you do the math

816
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:23,327
OK Google

817
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,607
Hospital

818
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:30,751
We all know we all know what it means when there's naked dudes

819
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:39,967
Oh there's probably something sexual going on there is his information it's like

820
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:43,551
I have never heard of you do the naked with a clit on

821
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,855
Classic hamburger place

822
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:52,255
Since I was 14 years old believe me if there was a two dudes naked with a thing at least know about it

823
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:54,559
Okay

824
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:58,399
So there's no evidence that Pelosi into paper in their underwear when the police arrive

825
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:05,055
Pelosi was asleep when to pay broke into the house so he wasn't a pajama shirt and boxer shorts so you could say that's his underwear

826
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:11,711
Initial reporting from KTVU Fox 2 it incorrectly said that the paper was in his underwear but this was a misunderstanding

827
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,991
Meaning of him being in his shorts

828
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:19,391
Paul Pelosi answered the door but the phrasing of the initial police report they didn't specify who it is

829
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,159
Answered the door

830
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:21,695
Leading right-wing media figures

831
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:24,255
Just assume that it must have meant there was a third person there

832
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,279
There was.

833
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,327
And I was just reporting that based on nothing

834
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,863
Baby song meme who knows

835
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:33,215
The websites and writings that were found created by to pay pornography

836
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:40,127
He did have a bit of a hippie phase back in like 2013 Butthead sense to send a deeply into extreme right-wing bulshit

837
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:43,711
Much of which matches a pretty well with the stuff Alex yells about everyday

838
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:47,807
Explain that he was radicalized by gamergate as is

839
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:49,343
The case were so many thing.

840
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,671
After that point he went off he conspiracy deep end

841
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,695
He has post

842
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,743
Including climate change denial

843
00:46:55,999 --> 00:47:00,351
Transphobia nonsense about the great reset 2nd Amendment fears 2020 election

844
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,119
Conspiracies

845
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,655
And of course Holocaust denial

846
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:09,311
It's fair enough to say the a two-phase where he was into a presumably left-wing hippie nudist lifestyle but that ended a long time

847
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,079
Time ago

848
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:13,407
I'm not sure if anyone really wants to call this the new January 6th

849
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:19,807
On a completely different scale from a mob invading the capital but it would also be dishonest to not recognize some

850
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,087
Important similarities

851
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:27,743
Both events in Baltimore targeting Nancy Pelosi at least it's somewhat in some capacity they were motivated by

852
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:30,303
Buy conspiracy b******* about the election being stolen

853
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:35,679
Both events involve people bringing zip ties which gives some indication of an intent to take hostages

854
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,471
Honestly the people who respond

855
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:41,055
The same way they did to January 6th our folks like Alex

856
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:46,175
The same knee jerk denial is being employed because this attack threatens him in a way that

857
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:48,479
The same as January 6th dead

858
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:54,623
They can't be allowed to be seen as a natural conclusion his ideology and rhetoric because then is a society we might wait

859
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,671
The fuk up and start taking this stuff seriously

860
00:47:57,439 --> 00:48:03,071
The extreme right-wing Community learn their lesson from how huge setback the Oklahoma City bombing was

861
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:06,655
Did the ability for militia groups and extremist cells to organize

862
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:08,959
And they don't want to have to do that work again

863
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:11,007
Read normalizing the right out

864
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:14,591
Right so they don't want something to be very well understood

865
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:20,991
To be like oh yeah this is this is kind of what you're going to end up this is the end result of

866
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,015
For me

867
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:22,783
Like

868
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:25,343
I do feel somewhat for the proper

869
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,111
Afghanistan

870
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,135
Stochastic terrorism

871
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:29,439
Somebody think of the propagandists

872
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,975
It's just too easy now

873
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:31,999
You know like

874
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:38,911
All they had to do was throw out a little homophobia and then everybody's like all will do it but the

875
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,447
Pelosi's are all liars

876
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:46,847
Come on a higher class of criminals here

877
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:53,247
What are the reasons why a lot of these folks don't really interest me that much these folks

878
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:55,295
In the the propaganda game

879
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:59,647
What element is the Trolli aspect of it I just fine done Charming

880
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,439
It is but it's just

881
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,463
So f****** easy

882
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:04,767
Alex

883
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:08,351
There has there's a there's an under painting of this

884
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:11,679
Do you know JBS Inspire Dance Academy there

885
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:18,079
Identity kind of religious beliefs in the militia movement of the 90s still connected

886
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:18,847
2

887
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:19,615
You know there's

888
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:22,175
He's he's connected to the past and the present

889
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:22,943
Which is

890
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:29,343
Yeah it's someone who was a higher class of criminal who is descended into just being at Rowley bulshit lose

891
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,415
Loser it is it is kind of an interesting like

892
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:35,231
We have someone tracked the the fall

893
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:39,583
Yeah I was not just Alex but all of right-wing propaganda really

894
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,351
Pathetic now

895
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:41,375
The kit is

896
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:44,191
It's all so pathetic that it

897
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,215
Still is effect

898
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:51,615
Yeah that's that's

899
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:53,151
Really didn't have to try that

900
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:56,991
Infinite universes there's got to be one where Alex

901
00:49:57,247 --> 00:50:00,063
Stuck to his guns and didn't take the bait on like

902
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,855
Meme s*** yeah

903
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:04,159
Hanging out with people like Carpe donktum

904
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,463
Like

905
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,231
You know

906
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,511
That's a better world

907
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,279
Yeah

908
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:11,839
What can you do

909
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,887
Alex says interviews

910
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:16,447
Okay I haven't heard any reason I don't believe they exist

911
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:18,751
Commodus

912
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:21,823
I have done

913
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,871
Hundreds of interviews in the last

914
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:27,455
And hundreds more I didn't have the time and energy to do

915
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,319
Apologize you were right

916
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:34,879
Motors really wanted forcibly injectors

917
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:35,903
Becoming a

918
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:38,207
The building covid camps

919
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,231
What do we do

920
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:45,887
Who are these people who are these interviews that he's done on these major platforms

921
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,959
Apologizes a lot of claims

922
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:53,055
Quickly yeah that are absolutely insane I can't imagine any of that true

923
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:54,847
I'm interested in seeing these interviews

924
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:56,639
I've been there's hundreds of them

925
00:50:56,895 --> 00:51:01,247
You can't shake a stick without hitting an interview that Alex has done it yet somehow

926
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:05,343
I've seen none of the work Kasian

927
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:06,367
No

928
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:08,671
Was hundreds of interviews

929
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:15,071
I guess maybe it's like a hundreds of interviews with his lawyers or something

930
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:21,471
And you know go on a vision Journey do something along those lines really figure s*** out your Mancow could hook him up

931
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:24,799
He got to you got to do that for a bit

932
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:27,103
So this makes what I think is actually eight seats

933
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,919
Super revealing

934
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:31,199
Bums me out a lot

935
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,759
Viewers of the crew

936
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:36,831
Because

937
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,367
We're being Vindicated

938
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:39,903
Good chance

939
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,183
Oshopping global

940
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:41,951
Close together

941
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:44,511
By the day more and more people

942
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:45,791
Shifter 4 speed

943
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:46,559
Effective

944
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:49,119
Being a nice good person

945
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:49,887
But you still are

946
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,679
What you thinking like a glove

947
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:53,215
Document

948
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:54,751
Understanding just how

949
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:58,591
It's hard to get your mind around but once you see things

950
00:51:58,847 --> 00:51:59,871
Rise

951
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:01,663
There's no pudding

952
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:08,831
This is how Alex gets away with the fact that his primary sources don't say what he claims they do

953
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:12,415
You can't read a document and just think it means what it says

954
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,695
No no no

955
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:17,535
Before you read it you need to run that document through the globalist filter

956
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:24,191
Homeland Security paper might suggest extending Refugee status to a larger number of people and you could accept that mean

957
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:28,543
Things that the author is suggesting that the US should extend Refugee status to a larger number

958
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:29,311
People

959
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:34,431
But if you're able to think like a globalist then you can clearly see that what they're really suggesting

960
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:40,063
Is that hundreds of millions of unvetted immigrants should be ushered into the country so they could be foot soldiers of the Democratic Party

961
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:42,111
You think like a globalist

962
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:48,511
The game is really transparent but honestly I haven't heard Alex express it quite like this very often

963
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:51,071
You can't just read things you have to read the music

964
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:51,839
Code

965
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:53,375
Cybernetic bonus

966
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:59,775
Alex is just made up these globalist and imagine what their plans are so guess who gets to be the sole Arbiter of how the code is

967
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:02,847
Translate it's really nice and really convenient

968
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:09,503
What's an audience except to this kind of bulshit they're essentially allowing demagogue to be their soul contact point with real

969
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:16,415
Alex has appointed himself as the person into who will have what amounts to the final say on whether something is real or not

970
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:21,023
In essence demanding that the audience subordinate their own senses to him

971
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:23,583
It's really pretty abusive but on other hand it's

972
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,351
Just dumb

973
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:31,007
Context is important in understanding the jargon that's used in various field is critical to understanding how to read documents

974
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:37,151
Pretending the written in some kind of a sneaky code that only Alex's dumb ideology can unlock that's a kids game

975
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:42,271
You might as well tell the audience that he has a signed confession from Klaus Schwab but it's written in invisible ink

976
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:48,671
Another critical issue is that Alex has basically the worst person you can trust about whether or not something is real

977
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:53,535
He's been completely wrong about pretty much every world event I can think of any lack

978
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,583
Basic reading comprehension skills

979
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:59,423
He lies about his own past actions and beliefs constantly

980
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:05,823
He's been tricked by fake documents multiple times including these Soros antifa contract that one of his employees found

981
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:06,591
4chan

982
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:09,919
He has to this day never issued a correction for

983
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:15,295
Thinking like a global this just means accepting Alex's version of reality despite what your eyes tell you

984
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:16,319
It's culture

985
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,343
Two things

986
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,367
First

987
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:22,207
90% of what you just said also applies to

988
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:24,767
The Pope

989
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:28,863
I think one of the other things in there that he accidentally revealed is

990
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:29,887
Just that

991
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:31,935
Listen once you get this

992
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:33,983
You'll go from being a nice person

993
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:35,263
I mean you'll still be

994
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,799
Nice which is a good way of saying

995
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:40,639
You're going to become more violent if you start behaving

996
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:42,687
I'm thinking the way that I have described

997
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:44,991
Overtime like he's literally saying

998
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:51,391
If you do this right eventually you will break into Paul Pelosi's house you will because you will become

999
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:57,791
Come able to look at primary documents and find rationalizations to breakage.

1000
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:00,351
SMS

1001
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:04,959
I think that I think that's really an important aspect to understand

1002
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:10,335
And it's one of the reasons why it's deeply frustrating to be able to like fact-checked stuff and look at

1003
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:12,895
Like where are you getting these ideas from it

1004
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:15,711
Doesn't say that at all he doesn't need to

1005
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:18,527
I wonder if it even applies to the Bible

1006
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:24,159
For Alex

1007
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:29,279
Baby didn't write the Bible

1008
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:33,375
The people who say that Jesus himself didn't write the Bible our global

1009
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,423
I'm confused

1010
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:37,727
Fruits

1011
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,263
Has done hundreds of interviews

1012
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:41,823
People of apologize haha

1013
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:42,847
Is bigger than

1014
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:49,247
Ever I don't know how that can any of that can be true but I believe you are bigger than ever in terms of judgments against that

1015
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:54,111
That's fair nobody's ever had that they are about as in-depth as you possibly could be

1016
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:57,695
What's to talk about how big they are

1017
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:00,511
Very powerful report that needs to go viral

1018
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,303
. video

1019
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:03,839
Rebuilt

1020
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:07,679
Great contributors

1021
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:09,727
Reaching millions of people today

1022
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:13,055
Videos with the other videos getting noise of you today

1023
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,895
Fox6

1024
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:20,223
Thousand thousands a day

1025
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:21,503
Yeah

1026
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:22,783
No that's

1027
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:23,551
That's a bit of an

1028
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:29,951
Exaggeration of pretty much everything about back doctor dl1000

1029
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:36,351
Yeah for his shows and if he has some like really flashy shorter video maybe it'll get to little do some number

1030
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,887
But yeah

1031
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:43,007
It was Saturday shows they actually do get a bigger crowd because they're not on the radio stop bottleneck

1032
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:47,103
Still generally those are often under a million

1033
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,895
Premier received big drop-off

1034
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:54,783
Harrison Smith American Journal is typically between ten and fifteen thousand views which is a disaster

1035
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:59,903
Owens War Room usually hovers around a little over 30,000 which is similarly awful

1036
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:00,927
For what they're doing

1037
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:07,583
Gregory's Especial reports off of between 500,000 and a million views which I believe is the highest consistent viewership

1038
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,375
Of the Infowars in-house team

1039
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:15,775
Wow holders Watson has a miniscule amount of viewers because he's still on other platforms and why would you go to Alex

1040
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:17,823
The site wouldn't get that s*** somewhere else

1041
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,615
Same thing with Rodgers Channel

1042
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:20,383
None of this

1043
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:26,783
Three episodes of The Stone Zone that he's posted in the past month have over 600 views which is because he's primarily on Frank's

1044
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:28,319
Beach now I'll just go there

1045
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:32,159
My most of the other s*** on this website is a ghost town

1046
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:37,535
Gerald Celente as a channel no one cares Tommy Robinson as a channel no one cares

1047
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:45,727
He was real bad. Might be out now

1048
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:52,127
Someone named Allison has something called Allison's rage page which is a zero David Icke and his son

1049
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:55,455
Both have channels which are going nowhere

1050
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:57,247
Rate I was too

1051
00:57:57,503 --> 00:58:01,599
I thought I lost interest America

1052
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:04,927
Honestly many of these channels aren't even actively post

1053
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:09,023
Sing stuff probably because people thought they'd give it a whirl and then they realized it wasn't worth

1054
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:10,559
But it's a dismal

1055
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:14,399
Situation over there and if Alex is paying as much as he claims he is for bandwidth

1056
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:15,423
It's

1057
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:19,263
He's losing a lot of money not a good idea

1058
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:22,335
Who downsized

1059
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:24,383
Pay for Allison's rage page

1060
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:29,503
Hi it's hard not to think that one of the biggest problems with Infowars is just overhead

1061
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:35,903
Overhead I want to cut some Corners here but we got out we got to post a new video

1062
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:42,303
I'm salty cracker you know if we got to post a new video

1063
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,071
On the street

1064
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:49,471
If you really stop and think about it maybe if the overhead wasn't so high they wouldn't have chased after so many of these false Flags

1065
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:52,031
Story so hard to get money and then

1066
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:56,639
Where would we be now keep a low profile

1067
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,199
Good work

1068
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:01,247
I don't think of that

1069
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:07,647
Kohinoor Harrison will be getting back to more views of History podcast

1070
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:08,927
100 grand

1071
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,719
So Alex

1072
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:12,255
Is what

1073
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:14,047
One thing he's consist

1074
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:15,327
That's not true

1075
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:17,375
But he is consistently wrong

1076
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:19,423
That is about story

1077
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:21,983
And when he's wrong about something he likes to

1078
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,519
Continue to be wrong about it

1079
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:25,567
Talk to a little bit more about Paul Pelosi

1080
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,895
The other huge

1081
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:31,199
Economy news Russia War news

1082
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:35,551
Wasn't attack

1083
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,367
Nanbaka

1084
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,135
It looks like

1085
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,671
Another drug-fueled

1086
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:47,327
All of that coming up

1087
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,095
And more

1088
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:53,727
You want somebody to take

1089
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:00,127
The big media

1090
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:03,711
We're doing

1091
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:10,367
We are recognized by the globalist has

1092
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:12,671
The biggest threats

1093
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:17,023
So I know most a-listers get this but I want to really sneak into the mass

1094
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,839
But never spread the word

1095
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:21,375
Or never go buy a book

1096
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:22,399
Or supplement or

1097
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,679
Film

1098
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:24,447
Or t-shirt

1099
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:28,543
We don't have George Soros of the New World Order funding

1100
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:31,615
We have negative a billion dollars

1101
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:36,991
You know you got a sales pitch year that comes off the continuing the Paul Pelosi

1102
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:41,343
I do like the idea that he's calling it an operation

1103
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:43,903
Hey Heyday hammer

1104
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:45,439
Drug orgy

1105
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:46,719
Operation

1106
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:48,767
You know what it is

1107
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:49,791
I don't

1108
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:53,119
They Hammer drug orgy operation

1109
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:53,887
Classic

1110
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:58,751
I don't know how to put those words together in a way that makes

1111
01:00:59,007 --> 01:00:59,775
More sense to you

1112
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:04,383
I need you to work on it cuz I'm still confused

1113
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:10,783
So Alex I've mostly kept a close pin for the operation word and then Alex weaving it into an adverb

1114
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:13,087
Because I wanted to play this

1115
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,367
I just thought this was silly

1116
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:15,903
You need to experience

1117
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,439
Text three most people alive

1118
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,047

Big Democrats

Supporter on record

1159
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:13,407
The website

1160
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:16,735
Person

1161
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:18,015
Are not true

1162
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:19,295
Are you don't like the spin

1163
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:23,647
No see this problem with the spin

1164
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:24,415
Is that

1165
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:25,183
They

1166
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:27,999
United States media is not reporting

1167
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:31,839
On a gay Hammer orgy situation

1168
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:32,607
Operation

1169
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:34,143
Operation

1170
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:37,215
For sure

1171
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:38,495
Ivy

1172
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:44,895
That is so f****** awful they Hammer orgy drug-fueled operation

1173
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:50,015
It is like I don't know how to be angrier you can just say like fussy

1174
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:54,367
It looks like it was gay guess what now of we can still be terrorists

1175
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:59,999
That's so f****** it doesn't even make sense if you're in if you're telling me there's a Hast

1176
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:03,327
Situation and both men are in their underwear with hammers

1177
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:05,887
I'm thinking that the guy who took hostages

1178
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:10,751
Hazel weird guy who made him getting his underwear and then got his own underwear cuz they gave him a hammer

1179
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:17,151
I think that would be an important thing to rule out before you jump to any other exception yeah

1180
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:23,551
His hostage situation was just a regular situation gone wrong right this is a hostage situation going

1181
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:27,135
I was going to go and I mean I think if you have misgivings about

1182
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:29,695
Details and information that fits their

1183
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:31,999
Hulk pump up baby

1184
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:32,767
You know like

1185
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:34,047
You know I think

1186
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,583
Think you can

1187
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,119
Bi-curious

1188
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:37,887
Without

1189
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:39,423
Doing what Alex is doing

1190
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,447
You're like

1191
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:46,847
Lamenting the spend well spinning so fast

1192
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:53,247
Instantly homophobic

1193
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:55,039
But he's f****** response

1194
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:58,623
I forget also

1195
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:01,951
Mirroring a victim of a violent crime

1196
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:06,303
Not not the smearing part of it being like a gay thing it's a

1197
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,327
The spirit habitat

1198
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:12,191
He was a victim of such like

1199
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:12,959
Walking

1200
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:15,007
Crazy that you can override

1201
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:17,055
People's brains that easily with being like Oh Sees

1202
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:17,823
He's probably gay

1203
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:21,151
Because it doesn't make any sense

1204
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:22,175
I think that

1205
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:27,807
There is a lot of that going around but I think Alex is kind of more focused on the hammer Park

1206
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:30,111
And I guess that's a plus

1207
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,415
Yeah sure okay

1208
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:36,255
When Paul Pelosi called 911 reply that tape for

1209
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,023
Anemometer

1210
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,327
Still doesn't have that.

1211
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:40,351
He said

1212
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:44,959
No he knows a man

1213
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,567
I don't know him

1214
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:52,127
We figured out how that sounds

1215
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:53,151
Completely made

1216
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:54,687
The police

1217
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,087
Yeah

1218
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:03,903
Notoriously democratic

1219
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,695
To release today

1220
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:09,023
Pelosi is refusing to release surveillance

1221
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:11,583
Paul Pelosi

1222
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,143
What his underwear in

1223
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:23,359
Call the police

1224
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:24,639
Then come back

1225
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:26,175
And join the man

1226
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:29,503
Then it began to hit each other with hammers again

1227
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:31,039
Again

1228
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:33,855
Put your hammer down

1229
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:38,719
I continue to try to attack

1230
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:40,511
Pelosi

1231
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:43,583
Some kind of weirdo stuff going on

1232
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:44,607
This is come out

1233
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:45,375
How

1234
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:48,447
This is this is some classic weirdos.

1235
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:54,847
F*** are you talking about we talked about this a little bit earlier I'm ashamed but I don't think there's a lot of hammer plague

1236
01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:00,223
What about the prospect of like.hot construction data

1237
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:08,415
What about that idea that you could listen to a man say that out loud and not go

1238
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:12,511
Well send him to Coyote land or something along those lines

1239
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:14,047
What about Into the Wild

1240
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:18,911
Alex isn't the weirdo they are the weirdos

1241
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:25,055
Bitf and he went into the bathroom

1242
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:28,895
Keep it together again

1243
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:31,711
You don't get to hit multiple times with a

1244
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:35,039
And somebody parts

1245
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:36,319
Certainly not

1246
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:39,647
It's usually one

1247
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:40,415
Oh man

1248
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:43,743
Yep Alex put the number on this

1249
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:46,559
Cops didn't shoot them because they were like

1250
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:50,143
This is the fourth Hammer f*** Weaver on.

1251
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:55,519
This week it's just a weirdo stuff

1252
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:57,311
The number on this

1253
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:59,359
About his percent trance certainty

1254
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:01,919
About his narrative

1255
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:03,967
So what do you want to bet

1256
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:06,527
Dish Network

1257
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:11,903
Two men in their underwear

1258
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:14,975
With hammers in a bedroom

1259
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:20,351
But you've got to find

1260
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:26,751
The police have guns on them

1261
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:28,031
Boatman

1262
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:29,055
Pelosi

1263
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:48,511
What

1264
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:49,535
In the hell

1265
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,815
Is going on here

1266
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,447
Nancy Pelosi

1267
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:03,103
9% chance

1268
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:09,759
This is some kind of weird wacko stuff going on

1269
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:10,783
I can't

1270
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:13,087
Find a way in my brain says jump

1271
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:18,719
Like here's my jump if I if I break into a room and there's two men make every like wearing their underwear with

1272
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:23,327
Both of them having handers hammers brandishing them towards each other

1273
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:29,727
My thought is not like oh they're probably having some sort of sex game I thought is like this is like our five of some

1274
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:30,495
Some sort of fight

1275
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:34,079
Like a Family Guy cartoon fight that lasted over 6 settings

1276
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:39,455
An overtime their clothes ripped off as time went on until they wound up here like

1277
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:45,855
With hammers like that is the only thing that makes sense anymore reasonably wacko stuff

1278
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:52,255
I also just I can't get over the fact that Alex keep saying two men in their underwear with hammers I think he's like

1279
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:58,655
You do the math

1280
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:04,799
Alex continues his streak of being completely wrong about things that gives a 99% chance of being right about

1281
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:11,455
David the papers actually already he's been arrested he confessed to a crime and he's going to jail for a long time

1282
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:17,855
He's charged with one count of assault on an immediate family member of Us official with the attempt

1283
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:20,415
How we ate against the official on account of the performance

1284
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:22,719
Of official duties which could land him

1285
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:23,743
30 years

1286
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:24,511
Yeah that's

1287
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:26,047
That's a crime that government

1288
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:27,839
It's like to take seriously.

1289
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:30,143
For doing our job

1290
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:35,775
Then there's the attempted kidnapping of a Us official to retaliate charges could add years

1291
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:39,359
A real good fun time with this whole gay Hammer fetish

1292
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:42,431
Thing he's doing but the serious stuff

1293
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:48,319
Also I might last clip Alex said that they are refusing to turn over the security camera footage to the police and that's cool

1294
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:49,343
We made up

1295
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:55,743
I was just reporting based on some dumb s*** he's on social media but political political reach at the police and political

1296
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:58,047
PolitiFact spoke to Pelosi spokesperson

1297
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:58,815
And they both

1298
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:06,239
He's wrong about everything every like every detail

1299
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:08,543
Suspicions on it is wrong

1300
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:09,823
Fictional

1301
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:15,199
Please fiction you're not you're not even spinning a conspiracy with anything to it

1302
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:16,479
No pathetic

1303
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:20,063
It's a completely alternative reality

1304
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:23,903
The unnamed person let in the police

1305
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:26,975
I had to specs

1306
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:30,303
If you studied the

1307
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:34,911
What

1308
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:38,751
We're going crazy doing god-knows-what to each other

1309
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:41,823
The other one

1310
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,199
Really

1311
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:48,223
Really

1312
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:49,247
Really quick

1313
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:54,879
You're called a conspiracy

1314
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:57,183
All they do is lie to us

1315
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:59,743
History of fraud

1316
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:04,863
We would be insane if we didn't

1317
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:05,887
Question

1318
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:07,679
What's going on here

1319
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:12,799
Oh my God. I want to start a war

1320
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:17,663
So you might think that Alex is being homophobic by saying studying the lifestyles

1321
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:19,967
Of these we will lead you to believe that they're on meth

1322
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:20,991
So we're on coke

1323
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:24,063
But would you understand starting with the lifestyles of

1324
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:26,367
Hammer people I mean globalists

1325
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:30,463
Like the hammer Brothers in the Mario Brothers

1326
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:32,255
They were super in the bath

1327
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:35,839
Find if you will study these lifetime sales

1328
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:38,911
Give me one other example of a hammer

1329
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:39,679
Sex fight

1330
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:48,895
I just want an Icee Hammer MC Hammer

1331
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:51,199
About turtles

1332
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:53,247
Doris Day

1333
01:12:54,015 --> 01:13:00,159
MC Hammer vs Jim the Anvil Neidhart no that's a nay.

1334
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:07,839
Whose nickname is the hammer in subsequent scarecrow ahead of movie called The Hampton

1335
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:14,239
Adam Goldberg have the Hebrew hammer that's true all of these things could be there it is we're all at 4 now it's make

1336
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:19,103
Making said I'm just pissed that I already use the hammer Brothers

1337
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:22,431
He's questioning but this isn't questioning anything

1338
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:28,319
This is Alex lying about misreported details and bulshit meme cc'ing on right-wing social media

1339
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:32,415
Which has been laundering into being stuff that's been concretely reported by the police

1340
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:39,071
It's fine to question things and retain an open mind until you hear more details about situations but that is not what Alex is doing

1341
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:45,215
He's constructing an alternative reality based on nothing for his audience to live in so they don't have to realize

1342
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:49,055
How much they have in common with the guy who tried to kidnap the Speaker of the House

1343
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:53,151
It isn't good for business for Alex to let his audience realize how far

1344
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:54,687
Down the extremist Road

1345
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:56,223
He's taken them

1346
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:58,527
You might wake up and be like oh

1347
01:13:58,783 --> 01:13:59,295
S***

1348
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:01,343
Yo you might look around

1349
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:03,391
Look to your left look to your right

1350
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:05,951
Two of these people are Nazis

1351
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:06,719
Pizza

1352
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:12,863
They could be a crystallizing wake-up moment wearing an SS badge in your life

1353
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:14,399
Elon Musk

1354
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:18,495
Guy whose tree fruits will be determined at a later date

1355
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:20,287
Descend upon him like a zombie

1356
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:22,847
He did some stuff with this up Losi story

1357
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:23,615
Picture

1358
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:24,383
Elon Musk

1359
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:28,223
About the truth stop that

1360
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:30,015
Can I hear some of the memes

1361
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:31,551
Paul Pelosi crimes

1362
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,855
Hahaha meme

1363
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:40,511
You almost didn't fact-check Hillary he posted a link to an article from a fake news Outlet called the Santa Monica Observer

1364
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:46,911
Is a publication that has reported in the past that Hillary Clinton was dead but I can 2016 and the trumpet appointed Kanye West

1365
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:51,775
Do a high-level Post in the department of the interior and also that Bill Gates caused polio

1366
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:58,175
So they're just a few years earlier must go was understandably embarrassed when this stuff was pointed out about the

1367
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:59,455
Do you think he would like

1368
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:03,295
They didn't learn a single lesson

1369
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:05,087
So

1370
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:08,159
It's great having billionaires

1371
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:09,439
Run everything

1372
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:11,231
Friends rule the world

1373
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:17,631
There's other news that's really important

1374
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:18,655
Russia

1375
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:23,007
They have proof that the United Kingdom blew up the pipeline that sounds right

1376
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:24,799
Have the Russians official

1377
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:27,359

And there's a big bottle video

1379
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:37,087
Whether it's about

01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:41,951
Pushing its vaccinations remoting outshone

1381
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:43,231
Kyrie Irving

1382
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:44,767
Care about the impact of the word

1383
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:47,583
He's just a wealthy and titled visual

1384
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:54,239
2 oz

1385
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,007
Tweeting

1386
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:56,799
This video that I

Yeah so Russia has proof that the UK did that s*** with the pipelines but

1396
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,799
More importantly

It's not a big deal he's so used to people like in terms of interview my God so many unlike you

And he never likes to talk about himself like on the show he doesn't want to like you

01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:56,191

Towards Russia

1442
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:44,895

1447
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:04,351
Like some of those other You Belong To The Sopranos were like

1448
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:05,887
He should not have

1449
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:12,287
All the things that Alex

History for it I will give him some of those rants Over You Belong divided Beyond 100 interview

1451
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:25,088
News in the past month mostly about Alex's Ransom

1452
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:31,232
So yeah we check back in here and we see Alex come back from his work station

1453
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:35,840

1455
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:45,056
It's been forever since we talked about Allison presentation deprived of it because of his workation

1456
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:47,872
I feel like

1457
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:49,920
Sour grapes

1458
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:51,456

1462
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:04,512
I believe how we're going to end up doing it is we'll finish up the deposition stuff on Wednesday

1463
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:07,072

The gap

1466
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:17,312
But also I don't want to disappoint people because you know we talked about how there's 4 days of deposition

1467
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:20,128
Them are not as

What is a hamburger that other more professional shows that would be like

1471
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,512
Teething it out and advancing I like making it an event as opposed to

1472
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:42,144
Just being like hey that thing that everybody loves we're just going to throw that out on our Wednesday episode for fun

1474
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:47,520
