1
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,064

7
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,352
Alex Jones

00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:15,008
My bright spot Jordan is you had a few video game bright spot

. had a surly

10
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,848
As of late

11
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:25,248
My bright spot started playing it

12
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,040
Months back

13
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:30,368
I got distracted by something else and put it down

14
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:34,464
But there's a bunch of news about it being released on the switch

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,328
And that was baby remember that I had it already on the PS4 until I decided

16
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,632
How to get the back into this something to give it a shot

17
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,680
See if I can get back into it

18
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:44,960
They got back into it

19
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,496
Quite quite hard

20
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,264
Deep

21
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,032
Deep

22
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:54,432
Getting back into it I don't know

23
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:58,784
Yeah it's a lot of fun it is a good sensibility fun story good

24
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,064

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,600

27
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:12,608
I'm a little scared of it because I feel like I'm going to spend a lot of time in there good

28
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:17,984
It's quite easy to palaces at this point and

29
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,056
It's just shocking even having played a bit of it before

30
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,848
Like I made it through a palace and a half

31
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,408
The first timer

32
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,688
I'm still shocked

33
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,456
How long

34
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:31,040

35
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,344
It is a lot of it's a very Charming

36
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,112

And if you enjoy it there is a also a Persona 5

41
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:47,936
Sort of

42
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,728
Politely

Type game

45
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,592
It's not exactly like

46
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,640
But there's a little bit of a

47
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,712
Can Flash kind of things a little bit of a merging of

48
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,480
Potoo

49
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:04,576
My bright spot Dan is weird

50
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:08,160
The Al Yankovic story

51
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,184
Ball my God

52
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,952
It is

53
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:16,608
It is like I've read that I've read some reviews about it that were really really terrible like

54
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:20,192
Whatever it was and it's like I want there to be a disclaimer on the movie that says

55
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,216
Sorry everybody

56
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:27,104
Specifically made for Jordan Holtz what I would want if

57
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,200
Al Al Yankovic made his own biopic that what it is

58
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,224
Yeah yeah

59
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,760
I

60
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,552
I had heard that it was

61
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:41,696
Going to going to happen I was really worried about it I don't know about it

62
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,232
Looks so good perfect

63
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:48,096
It is so good I did not okay but not remembered that it was out

64
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:55,264
So funny so good so good

65
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,312
I honestly say to you this

66
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,592
He kills it

67
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:05,248
It just does absolutely amazing job doing the thing that he was told specifically to do any

68
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,016
He just Nails it

69
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:06,784
The whole way through

70
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,088
Great and his abs are unreal

71
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:12,416
Love it's like the Weird Al in real life

72
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,976
One thing you know by Weird Al

00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,024
Swallow washboard

74
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,887
Touchback on something

75
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,935
Well I know that I have mentioned

76
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,751
That Bray Wyatt is

77
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,335

The word is very hard now well I'm I got a

79
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,711
Cuz I know that we got to stay on

80
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,479
Most of the audience

81
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,503
I'm worried

82
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,343
I'm a little bit worried you're worried about it well there's

83
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,135
There's this person in a mask

84
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,207
Who keeps interrupting his promos with these videos

85
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,255
Andy the guy named Uncle Howard

86
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:52,863
I'm a little worried I'm a little hope

87
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,191
I

88
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,983
It's

89
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,055
It's trouble

90
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,639
I had such high hopes

91
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,199
Send a WhatsApp Uncle howdy

92
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,503
I'm your uncle how they

93
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,879
Oh no what is that what you're going to tell me

94
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,927
I need the threatening Uncle howdy

95
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,207
Dino's Secret

96
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:21,279
Sawed-off out-of-body walks over

97
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,191
Do you know part and parcel of

98
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,471
Of some of Braves.

99
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:35,871
He was also the guy doing a children's show Firefly fun house

100
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,455
Children shows can be uncanny because they are inherently of

101
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:45,855
Sir do I have the children's mind if you're taking that you're taking this children show host and adding a bed

102
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,879
Anna Stuart

103
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,695
Uncle how do you being something that you had a menace

104
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:53,023
2 is not really unfamiliar territory

105
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,047
I agree

106
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,327
Still worried

107
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,911
Totally I'm just saying that if you're going to do Uncle howdy

108
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:02,751
And you're going to elevate it into something that the legitimately scary

109
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,031
You give him the child

110
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:10,943
Koverman blood that's the combination that you got to go down if it's Uncle howdy Maybe

111
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,711
Maybe

112
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,479
I don't know

113
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,247
The thing that

114
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,527
The troubles me is

115
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:19,647
That like when break came back with the Firefly Funhouse

116
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,415
For quite a while

117
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,183
It was just

118
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,023
Fuses goofy children show host now

119
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,559
Concerned about that

120
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,375
Is well I'm not sure that it really

121
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,447
Felt like hey this is a good idea the moment

122
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
Maybe

123
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,239
But

124
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:39,871
We've already kind of done that that's an issue and now I'm I'm worried again

125
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,175
I don't know it'll take it'll take

126
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:48,575
An amazing swing to make me feel comfortable the WWE quite nice

127
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,903
Actually would saying we've done that before and I'm worried again

128
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,695
Yeah

129
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,279
I'll go howdy Ono Ono

130
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,071
Oh no

131
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,631
You know

132
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,679
Sometimes you just got to say we'll see

133
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,495
We'll see what happens

134
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:10,847
That's it that's what somebody says before being eaten by a Tyrannosaurus Rex

135
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,871
Jurassic Park

136
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,687
You know what maybe it'll work out this time

137
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:22,879
Anyway we're going to be talking about November 3rd 2022

138
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,695
Thursday of last week

139
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,975
And

140
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,255
I don't know I don't know if

141
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,559
It's just Uncle howdy or something but I forgot

142
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,607
The midterm for a man

143
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,423
I'll tell you a minute I forgot and I listen to Alex

144
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,703
To show that I remember

145
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,519
Yeah this show has

146
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,287
This is a lot

147
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,615
Does it

00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,663
No Kohl's

149
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:52,319
So that's not easier that'll be fun we'll talk about it before

150
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:56,927
A little moment to say howdy on Golden Boulevard.

151
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:01,535

Thank you so much

169
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,999
So we're going to get down to business on this

170
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,559
Very dumb episode of Alex

171
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,351
Very very stupid

172
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,399
Before we do here is not a context drop

173
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,679
From one of Alex's collar

174
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,495
Just wanted to make

175
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,543
Point and share Battle Royale with you

176
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
Yeah

177
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:19,871
I'm sorry what

178
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,407
See the battle Roar

179
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,431
But it's for a commercial

180
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,223
Specifically for a commercial

181
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:30,879
Cut is he saying Alex I want to cut a promo for you know not even bro

182
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,695
Hate you need to splice it in somewhere later

183
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:40,607
Kind of takes away the sincerity of the battle Roar if you're going into it with a you can use the truck commercial

184
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,887
Yeah that's kind of

185
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:45,471
That's kind of not good thing I like those colors

186
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,263
Familiar enough to be okay what's up

187
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:55,967
I'm going to do a yell at you and then I know you'll put it into a commercial I'm going to yell So Good Year to make money off it

188
00:09:56,223 --> 00:10:01,343
What a weird you know like there's a lot to unpack if you get deep in there as to how can

189
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,879
Can you possibly have

190
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,183
Created an audience that's like

191
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,207
You know what he needs

192
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,511
Me to call in and yell at him for me

193
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:12,351
You know you know what though there's really not that much to unpack you just did

194
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,959
So there's a lot of news

195
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,287
Live news

196
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,335
Climate change

197
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,127
Story that just will not go away

198
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:27,199
The Pelosi's don't want the footage

199
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,503
Under surveillance cameras

200
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,575
The Congressional

201
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:33,855
Police

202
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,647
Baby spend all the surroundings

203
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:44,607
Want the footage released latest gentleman they just don't want to talk about two men in their underwear

204
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,631
With hammers

205
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,399
Enable

206
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,679
It just gets

207
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,959
Crazier and crazier

208
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,287
LeBron James

209
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,055
Dayal

210
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,823
3 hours

211
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,919
Yahoo does want to talk about you guys hamburgers in a bad one

212
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,199
Sure seems like him

213
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:04,575
Wow I did not know that the story wouldn't go away I feel like I stopped paying attention

214
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,135
Yeah I mean I felt like the story

215
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:12,767
Bully went away there and then it was gone

216
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,839
We were talking about his show on like Saturday and Sunday

217
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,679
That's about the last we'll have to hear about the Pelosi s***

218
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:26,079
Still talking about it at the end of the week I'm sorry I have a limited amount of attention and sympathy for any

219
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:29,663
Anybody with over 100 million dollars I just kinda don't care

220
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:36,063
For somebody who is the victim of a home invasion assault with a hammer

221
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,087
Life does go on

222
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:44,255
Recovering he's in the hospital he's got better insurance and we did a guy who did it got arrested the keys in custody

223
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,351
I don't know how much

224
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,375
Too much

225
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,655
It certainly

226
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,191
Maybe something

227
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:57,311
To consider about the vulnerability of politicians and people were both hoping to violently Richard

228
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,383
Certainly that's a conversation

229
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,175
But holyshit

230
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:05,759
This story is still relevant to the Infowars

231
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:11,135
Tiny bit about

232
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:11,903
His court

233
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,951
Some issues

234
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,535
He could have made them all go away apparently yeah

235
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
You know that's what

236
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,351
Democratic Party

237
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,679
I told me

238
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,639
Airlab

239
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:36,991
I mean you'll be nice to me you only gross lawyers

240
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,319
I am happier and more live

241
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,391
We're being attacked

242
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
Be

243
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,791
So I reached out to Bill to get a comment

244
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:57,215
He said that he told Alex if he turned on the Second Amendment goddamnit

245
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:03,871
I did not get a comment from him

246
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:07,711
He said they do not do this

247
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
Damn

248
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:13,087
So yeah it's a it's a it seems incredibly unlikely that anybody

249
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,111
Okay listen up Ally

250
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,951
I bet maybe one of Alex's lawyer said that to him

251
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:24,863
Probably just say that you don't like guns anymore maybe they'll drop all this

252
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,399
I could see that being like

253
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:30,495
Message that was conveyed from Alex's lawyer that never

254
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,031
Came from anywhere else

255
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:32,799
Right

256
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:36,383
I mean you know it in in terms of jobs

257
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:40,223
Normally I think whenever I've lied to my bosses

258
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:44,575
About something that happened I felt bad about it and they might not believe me

259
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
You know those types

260
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,647
Thanks I mean if your work

261
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:52,511
Looking for Alex Jones and you got your ass kicked in a in a law situation you can just lie to him and I'll be like

262
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:56,863
That sounds more true than that we got our ass kicked for lying all the time how could we possibly

263
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:02,239
Obviously we're in the right so clearly it must be some kind of demonic

264
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:05,567
They sent me one of my own daughters

265
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,103
Toes that's what

266
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,383
And that's why we lost

267
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:16,575
They sent me one of my ponytails

268
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,111
So

269
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:21,183
But we had talked about that Pelosi s*** out

270
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,279
We're not releasing while we're too naked

271
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,559
Underwear

272
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,327
Lammers

273
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,351
Diana bedroom

274
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,423
Pelosi said he knew and was a friend named David

275
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,751
On the Paul baloche attack

276
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,823
He woke him up

277
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,359
We wanted to try them up

278
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,175
He selling ended up using a hammer

279
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,735
The smash Falls skull

280
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,807
Thankfully by the grace of God

281
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,599
Paul survived

282
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,671
All this happened after the assault

283
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,767
And it just

284
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,095
Hard even say

285
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,655
After the sailing enter the home asking

286
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,935
Where's Nancy

287
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,727
Where's Nancy

288
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:11,103
Those are the very same words used by the mob when they storm the United States capitol

289
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,639
On January 6th

290
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,711
Footage

291
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
See that

292
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
Chance.

293
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,463
They had that guy

294
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
Drugged up

295
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,023
You know he wasn't. He's part of evolution

296
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,583
Pedophilia is

297
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,119
Girlfriends

298
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:33,887
In prison for

299
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,423
Behavior

300
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,007
What does downgraded this from a ninety-nine percent chance

301
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:42,847
Conspiracy to a 95% chance which would be relevant if the words

302
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,383
These that have any meaning

303
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,783
He just making up his conclusions and proclamations as he goes along so he probably doesn't even realize that what he's saying is that it's become

304
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:55,135
I'm more likely that the Pelosi home invasion was a real of that since the last time you put a number on

305
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:59,487
If you're paying attention to his show that's what he saying

306
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,023
No David

307
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,815
Wasn't part of a hallucinogenic

308
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,607
Cult any more than Joe Rogan

309
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:09,727
I would bet that he did do some drugs during his time living with some San Francisco nude

310
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,799
Distance from a hallucinogen called

311
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,591
What's your member valances audience

312
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:21,247
Then you'll actually believe that cities are burning and demons walk the streets of every urban center tackling and threatening any

313
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,783
Conservative or Dare show their face

314
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:26,111
That audience might be naive enough to buy that s***

315
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,391
But it's a small

316
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,159
Select group

317
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:34,815
Yeah am I also in my experience I mean I got to say a hallucinogenic called is usually pretty chill it's the

318
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,399
Organized around like money or power all those

319
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,215
That's going to f*** you

320
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:41,983
What happened

321
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:48,639
Some people take a hard turn on hallucinogenics

322
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
Trout

323
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,247
So Alex mentioned

324
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:57,855
The papes girlfriend there which is a reference to the high-profile nudism activists

325
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,135
Sent a Cisco

326
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,927
Gypsy Taub

327
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,951
Is her name

328
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,511
Okay. But she wasn't it okay

329
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,071
Probably not

330
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,399
It should be pointed out that she wasn't a nudist activists in the 70

331
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,191
Which is kind of where your mind goes

332
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,519
Closer to the 90s and early 2000s

333
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:19,615
She was a local character and actually has a ton in common with Alex

334
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
Princeton

335
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,687
She was a huge 9-11 truther

336
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,551
Public Access show call about 911 called uncensored 911

337
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:30,367
Which eventually became a show called my naked truth

338
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,903
Where she would host a talk show naked

339
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:37,279
I guess Alex didn't do his show naked but he got his start in public access and he was super into 9/11

340
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:40,095
Conspiracy so him and Todd would probably have lots of bond over

341
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,423
You may notice that Alex says that she's in jail for

342
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,471
Coach pedophile Behavior

343
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
Yeah that's

344
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:51,871
Typically this would be Alex using suggestive language to implant ideas in his audiences hatch

345
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,431
In this case however he just doesn't actually know anybody

346
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:57,503
Details of the case but he feels like he heard something that was like that maybe

347
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,295
With pedophilic but he wants to keep it vague.

348
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,879
Just in case change things up

349
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:07,487
Tom is in jail for stalking and harassing a former friend of her son

350
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,023
Who she sent messages

351
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,863
Is expressing her love for and who she made actions towards attempting to kid

352
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,703
He was in the ninth grade at the time and her actions are represents

353
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
Wow

354
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:21,567
There's no indication that the paper had any involvement with that stuff though because

355
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,103
Split in 20

356
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:27,455
2015 and she said that even at that point he was less a romantic partner

357
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,015
I'm more of a roommate and someone who took care of the kids

358
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,063
Who maybe his kids as well

359
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:35,391
It reported that he's the father of her children but this whole thing

360
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,951
Chaotic and I have no idea what's what

361
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:43,839
20 year old named James Smith in 2013 and to pay pay a loss

362
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,143
Contract contact a little bit after that point

363
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:49,727
She told the San Francisco Chronicle that she assumed he'd quote

364
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,007
Completely lost his mind

365
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:51,775
After that point

366
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,335
Does make some interesting points

367
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,103
Inasmuch as

368
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,943
She felt that the paper wasn't really a trump guy or a right-winger which mites

369
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,735
Stream True to her on the surface

370
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,879
The nature of this conspiracy world that's so prominent now involves the denial about the actual political under

371
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,903
Meaning of the

372
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,927
Conspiracy beliefs

373
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,695
But U-Haul

374
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,463
You may think

375
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,999
But you're just supposed to the Deep state

376
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,303
Cabal or something and have no connection

377
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,095
It all to the ways with

378
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,375
Conspiracy belief is used

379
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:20,447
Invalidate an attack any kind of federal bureaucracy

380
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,751
In your mind you're against

381
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,543
Demon to drink children's blood

382
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:30,175
But the real-world implications of your belief serves only explicitly right-wing political goals

383
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:33,759
You might notice that no one arrives at left-leaning politic

384
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,551
By obsessing about Soros

385
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,575
Sir Klaus Schwab

386
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,111
Some for that

387
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,135
Two dynamic

388
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,183
B built-in you don't read

389
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,743
You're not supposed to realize how all this

390
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,535
This conspiracy is geared towards

391
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,607
Funneling you towards the extreme right-wing political

392
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,631
ASAP

393
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,423
But you don't identify as

394
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,215
Extreme right well I mean

395
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,519
Because people don't talk about it

396
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,287
Totality

397
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,847
For the most part you know people aren't saying you know like

398
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,383
Once these

399
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:03,711
Far-right billionaires in such get into power

400
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:09,855
They slowly or quickly a road all of the safeguards of society

401
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,135
The conspiracy person I like

402
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:15,487
Societies falling apart well just because of the people that you are accidentally

403
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,047
Maintain their power and its

404
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,327
You give them more power

405
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:23,167
They make Society crumbled more you get more invested in your bowl

406
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,959
Bulshit and isn't nasty Circle

407
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,007
Sure everything about this

408
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:30,591
This kind of dynamic you know you have like this like

409
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,383
Complete opposition

410
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,663
Too deep

411
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,943
State bureaucracy

412
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,967
And what have you

413
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,247
And like

414
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,527
Yeah where the rubber meets

415
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,831
The road in reality is like oh okay

416
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:47,231
You know end up getting a bunch of Republicans in office and they want to get rid of Social Security what is that if not

417
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,511
Emblematic of

418
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,583
Deep state bureaucracy and there's so much

419
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,911
I hope that that is where the like

420
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,215
Conservative and right-wing politics

421
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,263
Are the end result of

422
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,311
The obsession that they've gotten YouTube

423
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,847
Think isn't political

424
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,151
And then I mean you know and the

425
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,687
Circumstances being

426
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,967
Because of what they

427
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,735
They do

428
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,783
It reinforces your distrust

429
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,551
Best of

430
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,879
Except for not them because they're the ones

431
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,647
You trust

432
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,672
Cuz they blame the other

433
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:21,536
Until you're told to label them a rhino or something and then

434
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,328
Too late anyway

435
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:26,400
Toby's clearly unwell as his depaepe

436
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,936
But they currently aren't

437
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:30,752
A couple and haven't been for even to touch

438
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:31,520
For about 7

439
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,848
Chuze charged in 2019 so there's no connection

440
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:38,176
Between the paper and her crimes and no evidence that

441
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,712
She was running a hallucinogen

442
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,016
This is just all like Alex talking

443
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:45,600
S*** because it's easier than focusing on anything of substance in the Run

444
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,368
The midterms

445
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
And why not

446
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,672
Socket

447
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,976
Yeah I know but that's a really interesting story

448
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,024
I would want to know more about

449
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,048
That whole

450
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,584
Circumstance or anime

451
00:21:56,096 --> 00:22:00,192
You know I mean if you want to know

452
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,240
Inelegant instead of Vista

453
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:06,080
Dude shows up at a hit with a hammer now it's two naked dudes a f***

454
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:09,152
Can you nope right and that but with hammers like literal hammers

455
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,456
And then instead of you know this

456
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:14,016
This person with a rich insane history

457
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:20,672
But we're just going to be like out pedophile Behavior whatever it is like no Manuel I made it does show

458
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,440
Sound like

459
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:24,256
Curiosity on Alex's Park

460
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,280
Yeah

461
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,072
This is way more interesting than

462
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,216
Anything else he talks about what's interesting to me is that like Alex could

463
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,240
Probably cast

464
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:40,640
A lot more suspicion on the story if he knew details better job

465
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:47,040
Conspiracy theory Rising if he actually cared to do his job

466
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,320
To help him

467
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,368
So Alex makes an announcement

468
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,136
And like

469
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,184
We were recording this on Sunday

470
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,976
I might have a really bad week ahead of

471
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:59,072
He's tempting me to get back on my b******* a little bit

472
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,376
McCall's

473
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,568
Battleground States

474
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,104
So we're going to be here

475
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,152
Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday

476
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,968
What's happening

477
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,296
Always talked about violence

478
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,832
An imminent Republican violence

479
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,464
False flag

480
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,744
Provocateur operation

481
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:32,352
The government's use all over the place they got to demonize me

482
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,376
Popularized

483
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,216
Russia

484
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,240
Plane

485
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:43,360
No one cares by popularizing the term false flag attack

486
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:47,968
Say everything is a false flag with no evidence and it's just meaningless to you

487
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,504
Whatever Putlocker

488
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,296
How do I resist

489
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
You have

490
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:55,136
Why why

491
00:23:55,392 --> 00:24:01,536
He's not going to follow through with it probably not and it'll just be his Junior Varsity Squad

492
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:07,680
These are going to be there he's going to you're just listening to him say I'm going to force my employees work till it work

493
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,240
Yeah

494
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:16,128
I know the only thing that's stopping me from EX

495
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,176
Really doing it is but there's nothing

496
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:20,736
Less compelling than watching me watch

497
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:26,112
Infowars health so I can't really do it as a stream of no real point to do that

498
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,904
Small facial changes

499
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,440
Yeah I Rob

500
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:35,584
It's not good content otherwise I probably would do it I would probably

501
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,728
Stream myself responding to be out of a job

502
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,776
I mean

503
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:46,592
Not a good laugh or not a good responder

504
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,176
Yeah probably not going to do it

505
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,272
Alex has some thoughts about the the

506
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,088
Some ideas of

507
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:01,440
I don't remember who it was it wasn't buying but there was another show that he plays where

508
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,464
He's sorta

509
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,256
Crazy world

The minority

514
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,936
They're a minority group

515
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:14,240
Okay people who have this ideology

516
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,008
He does not like

517
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:21,664
I am so he starts ranting about how they've almost taken over the GOP

518
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:26,272
You go to any Republican or any Rally or get any statistical number

519
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,600

The Republican party over

527
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,944

I'm on your criminal

00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,728
Your bones are dirty

540
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,264
Yeah I know I'm still writing

Prince Charles

544
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,928
You know this will come

545
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:14,048
This will be important later in this episode but that is a smooth 026

546
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,840
For Alex

547
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:21,984
I'm alright I'm alright alright

548
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,264
And you get like

00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,800
I don't know why

550
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:25,824
But it makes

551
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,896
Alex 08 Snapchat

552
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:33,504
The Hulk My secret is I'm always angry

553
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:45,536
That's why this this this transition from normal talking to screaming

554
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,816
Has like a dozen

555
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,352
It would if I wasn't coming it

556
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,912
Commenting on it it wouldn't even be like noticeable

557
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:57,312
No it's not

558
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:03,456
Slowly it set it comes up sell fake right right been in this make a note of that cuz this is going to be important later

559
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,504
Can meet somebody else who does this poorly

560
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,880
And it's a takes a while to

561
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,416
It's cause he said he was going to get to the media

562
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:13,952
It's not

563
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,280
And Australia

564
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:21,376
And Alex is obsessed with the idea that covid lockdowns are coming back

565
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,400
And what have you color

566
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:26,240
Apparently in Wuhan they had a small lockdown

567
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:31,104
Just trying to have zero covid policy and a couple times

568
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,920
Periodically over the last year

569
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:36,736
It'll show up and then everybody's locked-in yeah and then

570
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,040
But Alex

571
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,088
Is obsessed with like this is going to

572
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,624
Come back it's going everywhere

573
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:45,440
Victus color brings that up and he's like yeah

Started out putting them in years. That's going to be your wife

580
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,088
Restrictions

581
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,056
Judges are involved in

582
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,616
And drugs and I think it's

583
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:39,712
Agencies as well

584
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:42,528
Visine youth crime

585
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:48,160
Violin

586
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,208
Cityscape

587
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:55,072
Islands in South Philly weather

588
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,168
Vacuum

589
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,752
Exactly

590
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:06,080
Primary election

591
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:11,712
Tell me about all these things I said

592
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,552
Beyblade

593
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,392
Clearly technology.

594
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:22,208
Note of this planet and we have no business

595
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,584
Very interesting

596
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:33,984
What is a backlash in Australia when I see the people getting really angry at way

597
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:40,384
Alright I guess nuclear testing has caused

598
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,784
Flying things that are alien technology to be about it we should not deal with any kind of nuclear

599
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,344
Technology because it's not of this Earth

600
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,624
Long pause

601
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:53,184
Very interesting very interesting

602
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,608
This is exactly like

603
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:04,192
Most conversations I've had in the line waiting to get into a show

604
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:07,264
Concert of some sort

605
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,056
Like if I'm waiting

606
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:15,456
To see Sylvan Esso somebody's going to have a nice little conversation with you to be like this is great I am enjoying this

607
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,992
Aliens are coming for you

608
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,808
Damn it we're just going to stand here in silence for the rest of the night

609
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:26,208
Makes me it makes me think of that that exchange I had when we were in Hawaii I saw a guy who

610
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,256
He was complaining about Democratic politicians

611
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,048
I normally I would just be like

612
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:34,400
I don't know why I just ignored it but I like

613
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:37,984
Like I was in such a good mood is going to the beach

614
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,288
Alright

615
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:46,688
This guy talked about how these nuclear weapons are creating flying things that are not of this Earth

616
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:55,136
Alex has to understand that a lot of his collars

617
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:55,904
Not kept

618
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:01,792
To a very short amount of time to reveal some kind of a position or idea that they have

619
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,840
That makes their other positions

620
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,400
To hear about look a little silly

621
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,448
Alright you keep him on a short leash

622
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,728
Keep him on a short

623
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:14,592
So another caller calls in he wants to talk a little bit about the

624
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,640
Does Pelosi situation that everybody's talk

625
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:21,760
Everybody can't stop talking

626
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,344
First-time caller

627
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:29,952
One-dimensional

628
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,024
QuickBooks Online

629
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,096
42 years old

630
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:40,704
It looks like he's a pretty happy guy and I just think it's kind of laughable that they would put

631
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,008
Feeble

632
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,800
82 year old alcoholic

633
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,848
Somebody like that off

634
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:47,872
That would be able to

635
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:07,328
Conspiracy theory

636
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,144
I was just making sure. By the police report here

637
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,960
But this color is confused because the media

638
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,008
He's consuming is full of s*** right

639
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,360
It would be confusing to imagine that Paul Pelosi could take the paper in a fight

640
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:22,432
But that isn't really relevant because they weren't fighting

641
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:28,832
Wasn't there to attack or kill Paul he was perfectly fine waiting around with him until Nancy return

642
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:34,720
Paulding have to fight off the paper which is why the situation really isn't that confusing and he just

643
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,000
Get back

644
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,024
Alcanfor evidence

645
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:43,424
Isn't the new conspiracy theory but it is really fun that crnkovich is still a name that people like Alex say without feeling

646
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,960
Intense shame

647
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:47,776
What certificates describing is the same old game 2

648
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,800
Conspiracy theorist

649
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:49,824
I've always played

650
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,360
Essentially goes like this

651
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:58,272
There's an event that you desperately don't want people to accept his real because it's super threatening to your political project or

652
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,552
Propaganda business mod

653
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:05,440
You don't really have any direct means of invalidating the event and you can't really claim that it didn't happen so what

654
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,720
You do is you make

655
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,000
Ridiculous demand in

656
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,280
This pitted suspicious

657
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,816
Is that your demand isn't being met

658
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:17,728
Has no right to the surveillance video from the Pelosi household in the police have already said that the claim that they've refused to turn it

659
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,264
It over to the authorities his fault

660
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:22,592
But through repetition and an insistence that you

661
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:25,408
Totally believe the story they just made that video public

662
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:30,784
You can convince your audience that it's a reasonable demand and that it makes no sense of the Pelosi's wooden

663
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,808
Release the footage

664
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:35,392
Wouldn't they want to put that out cuz it would silence the dissenters

665
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,440
It's suspicious that they're not

666
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,000
So hoping there's a tried-and-true game

667
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,280
Gets played

668
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,072
Pretty much every time with

669
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,632
Conspiracies to some degree or another and it's a scam

670
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,680
Cernovich and Alex don't

671
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,984
Actually want any footage to be released

672
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:53,824
Because they know damn well that it wouldn't prove anything that they want proven

673
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:57,408
All they wanted the ability to use the fact that it's not really

674
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,688
Please do some kind of a mean

675
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,224
Introduce suspicion and doubt

676
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,248
In Their audience

677
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,784
You can see clearly that it work

678
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,600
And if it is really still be like all this

679
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:11,488
This is attitude and give us the uncut video

680
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:17,632
Not sincere what you're saying is is what would happen it would either be like

681
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,680
There's something that it in this

682
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:26,080
It's not really release that deep for me. Give it on to some other demand for information that suspicious

683
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,104
They haven't released

684
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:33,760
You know it's the it's the Obama birth certificate no we need the long-form

685
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:40,160
That's all just gone down this too many times

686
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:44,000
This is not how I wanted to find out that Ray Romano is an Infowars

687
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,536
I'll tell you that right now

688
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:47,840
You didn't hear that voice

689
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:50,400
Maybe I was just

690
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,168
I don't know

691
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:56,800
What was his knife his wife's name on Everybody Loves Raymond

692
00:35:59,104 --> 00:35:59,872
It's not ball

693
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:04,224
Get another get another call and

694
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:10,880
One of the things that's really a through line throughout this episode is Biden gave a speech

695
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,672
Amy talked about how

696
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,208
There's going to be

697
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:20,608
You're we may not have an answer for all of the midterm elections on Election night you know there's going to be some balance now

698
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,912
May take a while

699
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,704
Preparing People in

700
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,752
Like reminding people that that's the case

701
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,056
This is proof

702
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,848
Is telling people

703
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,128
About to steal it

704
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,456
So that's that's sort of the game that Alex is playing on here

705
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,736
That's what this color has

706
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:37,504
Thoughts about that

707
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,600
Speechless

708
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,648
Philadelphia

709
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,952
Which was so badly received

710
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:48,000
With this speech last night

711
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,280
Free calendar

712
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,048
Awesome hey it's

713
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:53,632
It's going to take us some time to count the votes okay

714
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:56,192
Unless you knew you were going to have

715
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,216
Stealing place

716
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:01,056
He was everybody not to question the steel

717
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,784
That's what he said

718
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,344
Nothing about how the country is going

719
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,672
Badly things are going

720
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,208
Not one word about that

721
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,256
Everything is

722
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,792
Paul Pelosi

723
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,840
Underwear with a hammer

724
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,448
I don't believe that and I'm just because like with the

725
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,360
There's no way that would have

726
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,176
Why

727
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:45,600
That just

728
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,392
Polaroid that script

729
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:53,536
Oh my God I guess I guess there's two ways you can really interpret that that would be that there was a script

730
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,816
For the attack

731
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,864
Part of this group was

732
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,704
Du Pape saying where is Nancy so they could connect it to January 6th

733
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,592
Or the other way I guess you can read this is Alex saying that the media coverage of it

734
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:09,408
Has the script where the paper didn't actually say where

735
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,456
Everybody is just saying that

736
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,224
So they could

737
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,504
Can I go January 6th

738
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,784
Except

739
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,856
The pavement is interview said that that's what you was doing

740
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:18,624
Is there

741
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,464
They asked where Nancy was in advance

742
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,024
Right to be that it was all fake

743
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,304
I meant to pay

744
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,584
Interview with the police

745
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,120
After he was arrested was also

746
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:29,888
PostScript

747
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:32,192
Really really important to keep this in mind

748
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:35,008
Because if this conspiracy is true

749
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,056
That means that when Alex is asked

750
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:37,824
Why were they

751
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,640
They found in the in their underwear with a grip

752
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,176
Well I mean was it

753
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,968
Cuz if it's not

754
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:49,088
That's a question that I need to know about how did we get to naked hammering I will say that if there is a

755
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,368
Play that I'm

756
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:54,720
Auditioning for and part of it involves getting hit with a hammer I'm not taking that role

757
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,768
Scripts are they right Northern like all right now

758
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:57,792
While you wait

759
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:58,560
Listen

760
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:00,096
I get it you're going to be bored

761
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:07,776
You did it the other night where that be I we all got together at Langley or whatever it is they're going to DIA

762
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:12,384
A f****** Is On The Rise by man what are you talk

763
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:15,200
Yeah it's a little bit strange I don't I don't know

764
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:20,064
You just that Alex says is that callers also don't ask follow-up questions

765
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,392
And so it could just sort of lay there as there was a script

766
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:25,952
And it doesn't really mean

767
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:29,280
Appreciate that somehow Biden

768
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,072
I'm saying it takes a while to count

769
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,376
What is not immediately off

770
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:40,032
Proof about to steal I feel like most of these people who are claiming that the conspiracy

771
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,312
Should really wreck

772
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,592
Recognize that it does take

773
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,152
Relatable facts

774
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:45,920
I have

775
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,224
A vampire puppet

776
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,272
But that I'd like to introduce them

777
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:55,648
So we are in a little bit for this guy and the other contacts drop

778
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,928
But here it is

779
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:59,488
Mr. Battle Royale

780
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,280
Just wanted to make

781
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,120
Commercial

782
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:07,936
But that looks like with all these narrative

783
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:08,704
A craft

784
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:12,032
People like you and people like me who want to build Meredith

785
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,824
Going straight

786
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,360
I want to bleeder 8U with my

787
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:18,688
Ideas for my speech embarrass you

788
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,712
The other wife

789
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,016
Okay no violin

790
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,040
None of that

791
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,064
We don't need that

792
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,632
I think I know how it feels I think I got it

793
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,192
I find it very sad

794
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,264
When I hear something like that I mean person of all

795
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:47,104
The way that the artificial growling

796
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,128
And stuff

797
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:51,968
It's a bummer but ya sattar is

798
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:55,040
Feeling that he's expressing that like we don't believe in narrative

799
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:57,344
Right

800
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,160
Shut up in order to

801
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,464
Storytown

802
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,744
I don't know what you're talkin

803
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,328
It must be comforting to feel like

804
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:09,376
That isn't how you engaged

805
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,400
Information

806
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:12,192
But it's not true

807
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:14,240
Anybody listen to Alex

808
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,776
Is a dick

809
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:18,592
Tannerite I mean it's always

810
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:24,736
Is everything is from a movie of course you're addicted to narrative and honestly I don't I don't think that narratives themselves

811
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,784
As a way to experience a lot of stuff

812
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,552
Is bad

813
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:29,856
It's just when they're the way most people

814
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,672
Strobe

815
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,976
You know narratives that are built on

816
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:38,560
Completely fraudulent information

817
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,840
Direct you towards

818
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:42,400
Really dangerous and negative conclusion

819
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,424
That's

820
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,984
You should probably recognize

821
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:46,752
Your

822
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,032
Not special

823
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,592
Your mind thinks in stories

824
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,360
Come on bro

825
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:54,431
Man I just

826
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:59,551
It's just so hard you know you want to think that you're an individual iconoclast

827
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,343
That acts like everybody else wish

828
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,647
She's they could and then

829
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,695
Someone listening to Alex Jones

830
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,487
You know I feel about that

831
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,375
I hope he uses it in a commercial

832
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:17,215
So Alex talked a little bit about his belief in electoralism

833
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:18,751
Which is weird

834
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,031
I'm sorry what

835
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,055
Well

836
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,847
That there's a reason that you should vote

837
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:33,343
Did little Democrats

838
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,135
They're going to do it

839
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,927
Being elected

840
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,207
Elections office

841
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,815
Steal it and do all this crap

842
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,095
He's doing the front of us

843
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,935
Nothing we can really do or what happens

844
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,471
We both need to steal it again

845
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:58,431
Do they have to use the names of dead people

846
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:02,015
And they have to use the next door to move out of state

847
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,063
Play have a limited pool

848
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,855
But they've got that's why they're picking

849
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,135
I'm sorry what

850
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,439
Angie Battleground

851
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,487
A massive tsunami

852
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:14,047
Here's a dumbass as simple as saying

853
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,095
A 350 million Americans

854
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,423
Voting age

855
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:22,751
Why why would you say that

856
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,799
Call voting Republican

857
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,383
They couldn't statistically say Republicans lost

858
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:35,551
That's basically what's happening Jared love you

859
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,319
Yeah

860
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,855
Yeah I think about it

861
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,647
All right so every

862
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,927
Single time

863
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,975
You don't vote Republican

864
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,767
Looking the Democrats

865
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,815
Use your name to vote Democrat

866
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,351
Only if your dad

867
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,935
This is one of the

868
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:58,335
Weaker defenses of electoralism that I've heard in awhile

869
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:02,175
Democrats couldn't say that the election was stolen or something

870
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:07,807
Also why do the people rigging the election need to use the names of dead people are people who moved out of state

871
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:11,391
If this is such an elaborate plot that they're engaged in why couldn't they create

872
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:17,791
Fake identities can't just make up names plus if the whole scheme relies on fraudulent

873
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:18,815
What's in dead people's names

874
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:21,887
Where are the examples of that happening in 2020

875
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:26,239
I don't seem to believe it's a rock-solid case that that's what they are doing and what they

876
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,263
I plan to do

877
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:29,823
13 weird that I don't think I've ever heard him site

878
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,359
One example of it happening

879
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,127
There is that

880
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:38,527
Did you know that if you cast an absentee ballot but you die before election day that they will invalidate your ballot

881
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,831
That happened to 3400

882
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,879
69 voters in Michigan alone

883
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:47,487
I wonder what Alex thinks about that and I'll continue wondering because he's never mentioned it

884
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:54,143
Also PolitiFact reviewed news reports of instances where people cast ballots on behalf of dead people and found that quote

885
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:56,959
A more often the perpetrators

886
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:59,007
And this isn't always a malicious form

887
00:44:59,263 --> 00:44:59,775
Brought either

888
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:05,407
Sometimes it's one of the cases where someone dies after casting an absentee ballot in the system doesn't catch

889
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:06,431
That does happen

890
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,199
Sometimes

891
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:10,527
Or in many cases it could be a relative or a loved one of the

892
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:13,599
This person who felt like Castor devoting their name would have been in

893
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,135
In line with their wishes

894
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:22,303
Still fraud but maybe it's not as rooted in evil or malice as it might you might assume

895
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:26,399
Whatever the case the frequency of people voting a dead people's names he's so small as

896
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,167
To be a relative

897
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,447
Is argue

898
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,215
Alex has

899
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:30,751
Is pathetic and meaningless but

900
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:33,055
That's because he actually doesn't want

901
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,591
Really think

902
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,359
The people should vote

903
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,383
He doesn't really

904
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:38,431
Uno's that if

905
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:44,831
That's his position there like that voting is meaningless and then nothing will ever change to that system a whole lot of his listeners will take

906
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,623
That is a sign that it's time to take a bar

907
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,671
Probably doesn't want to like

908
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:51,231
Fully endorse that publicly either

909
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:51,999
He wants a

910
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,279
Trickling of Chaos

911
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:57,375
The full-on unintended consequences version where

912
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:03,007
Right one goes out and kills all the police

913
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:07,359
Place and then storm is over guy home invading the Pelosi's

914
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,711
Cool can you get to make jokes about house

915
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:12,735
Difficult

916
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:16,319
But it worked out okay we can profit off that

917
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:18,879
I'm still being busy

918
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:21,439
Did notion of like

919
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,975
A bunch of Alex's audien

920
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:26,559
It's taking up arms or something and like it will never solve

921
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,095
This through the system right.

922
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,887
That's sad that's too much

923
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:33,215
Yeah I mean ironically that might be the only way to save them

924
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:38,335
Is if they were to actually take up arms everybody would be like maybe this problem is

925
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:40,127
Too big to ignore for now

926
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:44,991
Instead we're going to be like and I will just let him do it for another few years and then we'll live in packs

927
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,039
I don't agree with your position

928
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,063
No no no

929
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:57,023
Timeless

930
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,071
Thank you

931
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:05,215
Stop

932
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,007
Anybody

933
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,543
And I believe that

934
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,823
We will win the election by

935
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,383
Seahawks

936
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,015
Stop

937
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:24,159
We need that meal watches out there

938
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,791
Music

939
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,607
Case of a nuclear war

940
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,399
Is that Ray Romano

941
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:40,799
PhD but he likes the mule Watchers get to later

942
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:45,151
And also he's saving his X3 a case of a nuclear war

943
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:47,199
Man that is an interesting PhD

944
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:51,807
I doubt it's a PhD in the effects of radiation on the human body

945
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:52,831
I will say that

946
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:55,647
Sure or voter intimidation

947
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:00,255
So we have another color is fun

948
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:02,559
Gyro in Georgia

950
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:10,751
The New World Order

00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:13,055
I'm trying to tell you look

952
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:15,615
Spoke to you about a week ago and I don't know if you remember or not

953
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:16,895
Bonaire

954
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:18,431
What about

955
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,455
Baby doing

956
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,223
Spiritual

957
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,367
I told you I'm

958
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,183
16-year listener

959
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:32,767
Panther to you about three times this is

960
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,303
And today is my birthday

961
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,327
On top of that

962
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:37,631
What beautiful brotherly DeSoto prayer

963
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:43,263
So I'll get it I get a haircut of prayers, man

964
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,567
Yeah dude

965
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:52,735
I love this though a week ago this guy called

966
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:56,063
Special collars off the air

967
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:59,135
Animal

968
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,951
Yeah I think

969
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,231
I think that's

970
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:04,767
If Alex

971
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,815
Had been doing this kind of stuff

972
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:09,375
Like back in the 9/11 days and like

973
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,143
I call this

974
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:14,495
His career would not have gone the same way as it would because a lot of those people who were like

975
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:15,519
Ostensibly

976
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:19,103
Skepta cleaning and kind of atheist but also have

977
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,639
I'm leaning towards

978
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:24,223
Conspiracy they would see him for the religious zealot that he actually did

979
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:27,039
And I don't think that he would have had any traction

980
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,831
Outside of the

981
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:31,391
The extreme-right militia Folks at

982
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,671
The Christian identity folks

983
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:38,815
And I think that I think that would have been a better reality let me know that

984
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:45,215
Yeah I mean that I think most people do I think that's that's one of the things that we all I guess just

985
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:48,799
To paper over is how many of these benign beliefs are

986
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:51,871
I also how you doing some sort of like a

987
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:52,639
Passive

988
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,431
Acceptance believe so you know like

989
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,199
Hey listen

990
00:49:55,711 --> 00:50:00,063
That's not what this is

991
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,623
You know that's not what this

992
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:04,671
No no this is a little bit different

993
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:06,463
Passive this is not passive

994
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,767
So are we going to call her

995
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:10,559
They can steal it

996
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,095
Based on this Joe Biden

997
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:19,775
Daddy loves you Cincinnati Ohio

998
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,847
Red Wave coming and

999
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:26,175
Feelings about the elections even though

1000
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,455
Get away with it

1001
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:30,527
And

1002
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,111
Well I can't wait to see what they do

1003
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:38,207
Before Interruption on the open

1004
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:40,767
We're going to make them Steel in front of us again

1005
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:43,327
That's going to cause that even bigger Awakening

1006
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:51,263
I think the Deep Staters are going to let the Republicans win the house

1007
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:56,895
But they're going to mitigate this massive realignment just happen

1008
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:01,247
No Stealing tuna rolls too much

1009
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:03,295
Beautiful

1010
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,063
Because

1011
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,087
Yes

1012
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:09,183
Everybody is so fat

1013
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:13,279
I can see everybody just Etna Street

1014
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,047
I mean

1015
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,839
Crazy

1016
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:19,167
Everybody's awake

1017
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:23,007
Read Alex Jones

1018
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,799
T-shirt

1019
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:27,103
Store

1020
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,151
They know what's going on

1021
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,991
Sentence for fact

1022
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:40,159
I'm more mob than ever end

1023
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:47,839
Financial support that's

1024
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:01,151
They hate you

1025
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:04,991
Bad time to get cut off by the brake

1026
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,783
Are you giving me money

1027
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:09,087
LKQ you can give me a ride

1028
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,111
Yeah man

1029
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,135
That's

1030
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,415
Breast

1031
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:15,999
Confused as to why we don't just make

1032
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,279
Voting mandatory

1033
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:19,583
If that if we're going to have to fight all of this

1034
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:24,191
Every every election is stolen then just make voting mandatory everybody has to vote

1035
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:25,983
Steal the election

1036
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:28,543
If that were to

1037
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:32,127
Be something they were done then you'd have to also come up with a lot of ways to make

1038
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,407
It more accessible

1039
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,223
So I made her want to do that

1040
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:42,623
Yeah but I think if you go that route then you'd have to add a lot of other steps along the way to

1041
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:44,159
I mean obviously they don't want to

1042
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,951
To solve the problem they want the problem

1043
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:46,975
Going to be there so they

1044
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:47,743
You can blame it

1045
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:48,511
Whenever they

1046
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,583
Obviously it's not a problem they want to

1047
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,167
The electoral system is

1048
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,983
Much of the same as demanding the Pelosi's

1049
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:00,799
Exaggerating

1050
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:01,823
Complained

1051
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:02,591
But they have

1052
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:03,615
In order to just

1053
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:06,175
Justify their own police

1054
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:10,783
The notion that

1055
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:13,599
They can't steal two-in-a-row is silly

1056
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:19,231
First of all if you believe that there stealing

1057
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:19,999
These elections

1058
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:24,607
Then why not oh no they wouldn't do that we wouldn't buy it the second

1059
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:26,399
What are you talkin about you

1060
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:29,471
Assholes stormed the capitol

1061
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,239
The capital

1062
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:33,055
What are you going to CC

1063
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:39,455
We know you don't believe that elections are real right know that I mean it's it's legit just

1064
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,759
A way of

1065
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,831
Really antagonizing the audience

1066
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,111
And the space

1067
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:49,951
To be hostile and very angry anytime Democrats

1068
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:52,255
Well it's a and it's also a little bit like

1069
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,535
You know when you will

1070
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,839
We talked about voter fraud that kind of stuff

1071
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:59,935
It happens more often because Republicans do it then Democrats that kind of

1072
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,471
And that's parts

1073
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,495
We just psychologic

1074
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:05,311
You know like it happens more by Axel

1075
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:08,639
The point

1076
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:11,967
Is there priming them to say that the Democrats steal election

1077
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:13,759
And if you do that

1078
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:20,159
Then that means that it's morally okay for you to steal elections because they're already doing it maybe

1079
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:24,767
That's the way that they're their process works is they they bring it into a situation where it's like

1080
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:26,559
Obviously

1081
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:29,375
They're stealing election so there's no reason we shouldn't

1082
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:38,079
Stupid for us not to because then we're not even playing with fire

1083
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:40,127
Yes we have to steal the election

1084
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:43,455
You may you may you may have something there I think

1085
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:49,343
It's more just a way to always feel like you were the righteous party

1086
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,903
There a lot of good reasons to do evil

1087
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:52,927
Sure

1088
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:54,207
So

1089
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:55,231
My man

1090
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:57,279
This next caller blue my mind

1091
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:59,583
I believe you I don't know I still don't know what to

1092
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:04,447
I like to YouTube

1093
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,983
I like to donate to your

1094
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,287
And I like to do

1095
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,103
Because I have actually

1096
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:14,175
I like to donate to your legal

1097
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:22,879
We call this fella back and talk to his we need to fund

1098
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:24,159
That would be beautiful brother

1099
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:27,487
I don't believe this necessarily

1100
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:30,559
I'm going to guess you guys like replicas or something

1101
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,887
He's asking or offering here is a

1102
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:34,911
Ridiculous

1103
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:37,215
You can't truly believe that he's offering up

1104
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:41,823
Both an original and original put Caso and in original world

1105
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:47,711
The cheapest of Picasso's paintings still sell for over $100,000 and some more valued in the tens of

1106
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:50,015
In order for this guy to have this

1107
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:52,831
Someone would have had to pay a shitload for it

1108
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:55,647
If you're in the position to pay for a piece of art like that

1109
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:59,231
You could just donate money to Alex instead of partying with a

1110
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:00,255
Piece of history that

1111
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:02,047
It's only going to appreciate in value

1112
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:04,863
I think it should be illegal to give Art to Alex

1113
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:11,007
The value of Colby's has a bit more variable

1114
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,031
His Maryland paint

1115
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:15,871
Sold earlier this year for 195 million dollars but there are a bunch

1116
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,431
Books that are substantially cheaper than that

1117
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:22,783
If this is real and I have misgivings about that it represented

1118
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:25,087
Deeply fanatical and unhealthy attachment

1119
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:26,879
Making sure Alex stays wealthy

1120
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:33,535
Whatever amount you can possibly get from selling these artworks will absolutely not make an impact on his ability to carry out his legal case

1121
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:35,839
And honestly I wouldn't be surprised if Alex

1122
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:37,631
Big Y.

1123
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:41,471
Are going that's an investment like you have a Picasso

1124
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:44,799
There's not going to be more of them shouldn't be at

1125
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,079
You can't act

1126
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:49,407
No one can let Alex have art. M just a just against

1127
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:53,247
Said no sculptures no aren't Jordan consider this

1128
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:56,319
That Maryland painting is the most expensive

1129
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:58,879
Peace made by either of these are

1130
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:00,927
And if Alex Guthrie

1131
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:04,767
Yeah it's Alex got the full value from selling it he's still need like

1132
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:06,815
800 million dollars to cover

1133
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:08,607
Viskase Sandy Hook

1134
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:10,655
So I don't know I would

1135
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,191
If I were this color

1136
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:13,215
Hard to believe

1137
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,263
Do people think Warhol was good at stuff

1138
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,799
That's the weird thing to me

1139
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:19,103
Letter that Marilyn paint

1140
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,127
Thing is very iconic

1141
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,175
I mean

1142
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,223
Whatever

1143
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:26,015
Whatever art world

1144
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,039
What's next

1145
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:33,439
Skull crystal skull

1146
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,487
No okay

1147
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,279
Yeah. I guess

1148
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,047
The mostest

1149
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:42,143
I got really self-conscious about this cuz you were like

1150
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:44,447
Square has not expensive Guernica is

1151
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:47,007
Priceless you know like we're not talking about the same kind

1152
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:50,079
Something that's sold at been sold

1153
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:54,943
Article from 2015 here saying that

1154
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:56,991
The women of Algiers

1155
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:59,039
Painting of Picasso's is the most

1156
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,319
Expensive is that sold

1157
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:01,855
It was 174

1158
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,135
So

1159
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:09,535
There are there is a chance of their Picasso's that will never sell a Tartan Museum

1160
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,839
That makes Morse

1161
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:15,423
Can human treasure you know it's not like

1162
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:17,215
You could sell that I mean I suppose you

1163
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:19,775
You could because we live in 2022 plot twist

1164
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:24,383
Guys off right now

1165
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:27,967
We gave the fake to the Musial fund the info War

1166
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:34,623
So anyway Alex gets really excited about this idea of people giving him valuable.

1167
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:42,559
Want to donate we should create like a donated infowars.com

1168
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:45,631

A hundred percent

1174
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:57,151

Truck car in nice

1182
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,279
Deep house

1183

It won't pull the back and I just Suburban guy

1184
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:18,655
B

Pay 40% of legal bills

1186
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:25,567
Associate

1187
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:28,639
I wonder if Alex realizes it forty thousand a month is super

1188
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:30,943
Spiritually higher than almost everyone in his audience

1189
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:33,503
I mean unreal

1190
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:39,903
It was saying that it's like a modest living is pretty wild and saying it in the same breath or he's asking people to donate

1191
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,951
The Cars album pay his legal fees is

1192
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:42,975
Amazing

1193
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:49,631
Barry out at auction listen I'm salaried at half a million dollars a year now obviously the fact that I only

1194
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:50,655
The company and keep muscle

1195
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:54,751
The more money offshore and then Bitcoin and stuff so don't worry about that

1196
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:56,799
Sell your own s***

1197
00:59:57,055 --> 01:00:02,687
Yeah give me five grand to pay part of his legal expenses

1198
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:06,783
He's being sued and he owns a hundred percent of the company that's being sued with him

1199
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:09,855
I'd be willing to bet that he'll be able to offload

1200
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:13,951
All of that on to the company by Betty Assam language in his corporate policies

1201
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:20,351
There he doesn't cover legal expenses for employees something along those lines

1202
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:23,167
Don't sell your truck

1203
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:24,447
And give the proceeds to Alex

1204
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:27,007
If you're one of those nurses listen to this somehow

1205
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:32,383
A f****** Picasso can't save them 8000000 a Bitcoin couldn't save him and your Used F150

1206
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:33,663
He is going to do anything

1207
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:34,687
Other than get a few bucks

1208
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:35,711
Jackson Alex's pocket

1209
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:36,479
Save it

1210
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:37,759
Keep it give it to your kids

1211
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:41,343
Do something do anything at the kars4kids

1212
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:43,903
Light it on fire would be better for the world

1213
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:44,927
Metallic

1214
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,463
You can maybe do that is an art

1215
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:51,071
Installation maybe make a little cash

1216
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:55,935
Video of you lighting your car on fire new Guernica

1217
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:59,263
Silas complains about money

01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,871
60% off on all these

1219
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:06,431

Okay

1221

Buy something

1222
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:24,095
We're dealing with

1223
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,399
Maidana

1224
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:28,447
Jackson with the money to find this place

1225
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:31,007
What doing what

1226
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:38,687
Insolvent we were a year ago

1227
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:40,991
The money came and I'll provide again

1228
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,527
God's plan

1229
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:48,671
I'll never quit but I'll keep fighting as hard as I can

1230
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:49,951
Decides

1231
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:51,743
That I'm not supposed to

1232
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,047
If you decide

1233
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,583
God working for you

1234
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,607
That means you

1235
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,911
If you decide to take me out of the game

1236
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:00,959
Supposed to have

1237
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:05,311
Lady Gaga

1238
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:10,943
I don't want stop fighting

1239
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:13,759
Tell you that

1240
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:19,135
We need to go to infowarsstore.com and and get Alex's war or get endgame

1241
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,671
DVD to get a buck

1242
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:24,255
And I don't like coming on here

1243
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:27,583
And just give me money give me money

1244
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:31,679
Worse than me Dubai

1245
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:34,239
Yeah

1246
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:40,639
Yeah I dis is this guy's torture

1247
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:41,663
Yeah that makes sense

1248
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:44,479
There is

1249
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:45,503
No chance

1250
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:50,879
That 60% off is like him taking a loss on somebody's dumb pills

1251
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:52,927
I appreciate this cuz I thought occurred

1252
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:55,999
That you know we had a lot of situations where

1253
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:58,559
You could take Alex Jones clips from his shows

1254
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:01,631
And play them in the school setting and you can learn a lot

1255
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:03,423
You know for lawyers

1256
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:06,495
If you want to become a better lawyer you can place him Alex Jones clips

1257
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:08,287
You know what not to do

1258
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:10,079
You know how to not be a bad lawyer

1259
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:11,103
That also

1260
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:14,943
Accounts for business I forgot about that you could get an NBA

1261
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:19,295
By not doing what Alex tells you to do on it hurt says he's doing on his jump

1262
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:20,319
Would be a good life

1263
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:21,599
Anti marketing

1264
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:23,391
Example

1265
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:26,719
If you wanted to teach somebody how not

1266
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:29,791
To get a truck that last one

1267
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:30,815
Play

1268
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:34,143
This is like a richdadpoordad kind of situation

1269
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:35,423
Listen though

1270
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:36,447
Alex

1271
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:38,239
Feel sometimes like

1272
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:39,775
He can't ask for money

1273
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:43,359
Anymore he's just run out of it was just run out of juice

1274
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:45,919
He digs. He's got it in him

1275
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:46,687
I can

1276
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:50,271
I don't want

1277
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:52,575
I hate being on my business and my business guy

1278
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:55,391
I'll give into the new world order the ATL

1279
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:01,791
Please give me money

1280
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,583
Okay

1281
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:08,703
Okay alright

1282
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:09,983
Give me money

1283
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:13,567
Give me money

1284
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:17,663
Convincing

1285
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:19,199
Wow

1286
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:23,039
I mean I don't know if I've ever seen an argument board distilled down into the

1287
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:24,319
The things that he does believe

1288
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:31,743
News clippings but involves Alex yelling on the phone with another caller show

1289
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:34,559
We're losing which again

1290
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:38,143
Joshua makes them dangerous I'm worried

1291
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:40,447
About a false flag the next 5 days what do you think

1292
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:48,639
Is real I think I definitely want to Gin up a bottle violence they want to say how dangerous

1293
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:56,575
I want to run this country

1294
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:58,367
Republicans built it

1295
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:00,415
Republicans do all the damn work

1296
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:01,439
We all know it

1297
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:06,815
And they're everywhere

1298
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:10,399
Everybody knows real business people real hard-working people

1299
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:17,567
Republican party over we've almost done

1300
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:19,871
I appreciate your

1301
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:22,687
This guy is above the left-right paradigm

1302
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:27,807
Republicans built this country and they do everything

1303
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:28,831
Alright

1304
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:31,391
This guy should read and ran

1305
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,415
You know what's crazy

1306
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:35,999
I'm confused as to why they still think that false flags are,

1307
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:38,047
Well I thought mine was supposed to be dead by now

1308
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:41,375
Yeah but like we saw what happened

1309
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:46,239
Somebody made a harebrained attempt to assassinate the speaker of the house or the very least

1310
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:49,823
Hold hostage and everybody was like

1311
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,359
It was a good day

1312
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:55,967
People are concerned about it one guy went to prison

1313
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:58,783
Alex has done a whole season about Hammer f******

1314
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,599
Yeah Yeahs sweets

1315
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:04,415
I don't know if you make a good point

1316
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,439
That

1317
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:06,463
Seems

1318
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,231
It seems like

1319
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:13,631
Anything happening probably wouldn't make all that much of an impact you really feel like at this point everybody's kind of

1320
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:17,471
Everybody just expect political violence and now and if it happens will be like

1321
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,775
Well that's part of the game I guess

1322
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:21,311
Honestly

1323
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:22,591
Isn't that where we are

1324
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:29,503
I don't think it's where we should be no a 3-week statement of

1325
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:31,039
How

1326
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:33,343
Lackadaisical

1327
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:34,879
He's got enough power

1328
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:38,463
We'll get back to this here in a little bit this discussion with the mule watch

1329
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:42,047
And stuff like that is also even like

1330
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,607
Another lackadaisical approach

1331
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:49,471
Should be one of the most seriously taking things

1332
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:51,007
Yeah yeah but

1333
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:51,775
You know

1334
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:55,359
I mean maybe what if instead we should lower taxes for rich people

1335
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:58,943
That's an interesting idea I think I got to pitch for the Democrat

1336
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:05,087
I just got a text from my friend Marty DeRosa Hammer Time with Alex was a wild ride

1337
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:11,487
From somebody

1338
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:12,767
That's alright I should

1339
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:13,535
Come up with

1340
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:20,191
Another person that was Greg The Hammer Valentine another wrestler but I was distracted by Jim the Anvil

1341
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:23,775
I never came up with that one issue that correction in apology

1342
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,055
Hammer

1343
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:26,847
Uncle Howard

1344
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,407
Ellison

1345
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:30,175
Does next caller

1346
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:32,479
My God my God why this Ole Boy

1347
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:33,759
To be as how this starts

1348
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:38,879
Awesome I want more of this on Infowars

1349
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:40,159
Horseshoe

1350
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:43,743
Talk to Arizona

1351
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:46,559
You the man

1352
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,911
Phone World idea here

1353
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:52,703
You guys are in

1354
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:54,751
Louisiana Tech

1355
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,799
Louisiana

1356
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:05,759
Hysterical nonsense is going on about

1357
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:09,855
Seamless production to stop

1358
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:11,903
Doodoo butt

1359
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:13,439
Far as I know

1360
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:20,095
So so explain what's causing the bottleneck

1361
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:26,495
Windfall

1362
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:30,079
I agree that

1363
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:31,871
Inflation

1364
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:35,711
Bob inviting occasionally tells the truth he says I'm going to go out the door companies

1365
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:37,503
Definitely globalist

1366
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:42,111
And they're definitely part of the whole problem

1367
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:44,159
First of all

1368
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:45,183
Wow

1369
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:46,975
Lovett I've refused

1370
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:53,375
To hear that one time and then not not acknowledge nobody acknowledged

1371
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:59,263
That's the only thing I want to talk about

1372
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:02,079
There's a payoff is that you just have to pump the brakes

1373
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:03,615
Okay but

1374
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:05,151
He brings up

1375
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:05,919
Appoint

1376
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:06,943
And that is that

1377
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:10,015
Diesel isn't going to run out unless they stop production

1378
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:13,599
You got this wrong and Ralph has to come up with a way to like

1379
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:15,391
Kind of hold on to

1380
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:17,439
Is diesel fuel

1381
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:19,999
Oil companies are globalist

1382
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:21,023
But this does

1383
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:21,791
Doesn't work

1384
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:24,351
This is going to play

1385
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:28,703
His family is part of oil companies or whatever it is

1386
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,007
A good first

1387
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:35,103
Attempt and then as they keep talking these like oh no wait I can do this

1388
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:37,919
Reduction of

1389
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:38,687
Diesel has

1390
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:39,967
Austin

1391
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:42,783
Any new diesel at all

1392
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:44,831
If you do the app

1393
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:45,599
The numbers

1394
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:47,135
Planes out to

1395
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:50,207
Not you have any new supplies

1396
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:52,767
Behind schedule in major shortages

1397
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,303
Starting in like 12 days

1398
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:56,863
Crazy

1399
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:58,143
Because

1400
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:00,959
Wide shut down the biggest diesel refineries

1401
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:05,823
They shut down the system

1402
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:07,359
Yeah they're there are

1403
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,895
Applied problems

1404
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:12,479
I talked to Oil Company folks that work at every level of it at most

1405
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:14,271
A lot of my family works at every let

1406
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:15,551
Roughnecks

1407
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:18,879
Answers to unit delivery companies

1408
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:24,511
The last four years under the lockdowns in control

1409
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:26,303
Oil well

1410
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:28,863
Equipment

1411
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:35,775
Plants are breaking down

1412
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,055
Yeah yeah

1413
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:39,359
It kind of makes me want to scream like my

1414
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,383
Screaming goat

1415
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:44,223
Call brother

1416
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:46,527
No

1417
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:48,831
No no.

1418
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:53,183
Okay little shoehorned a moto Force what do we got here

1419
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:59,583
I mean does he have what I want to know is mechanics now I want to know what requipment

1420
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:05,983
Probably like on a app on his phone or something what you've got

1421
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:10,335
What is somebody who's on house phone but has a cell phone that has a soundboard app

1422
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:11,871
That's my guess maybe

1423
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:14,943
Casio keyboard

1424
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:18,527
You can have one of those little keyboards it's got all the screaming goat

1425
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:19,551
In there who hasn't

1426
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:23,903
Spent the day programming a screaming goat into their keyboards

1427
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:29,023
You might be right but it doesn't matter

1428
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:30,815
Alex is trying to find a way for his

1429
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:32,607
Conspiracy to make sense by making

1430
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:34,911
Things up as he goes along and it's

1431
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:36,703
Really good way if you want to do the

1432
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:41,311
That's a good way to do it is to make up personal stories from random people that you know to defend your point

1433
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:43,103
Anecdotal evidence

1434
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:44,383
Yeah

1435
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:47,967
These are compelling things for his audience these anecdotal stories

1436
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:50,527
Because other narrative-driven people

1437
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:56,927
And Alex knows this week and manipulate them was storytelling regardless of what that passed College sets

1438
01:11:57,183 --> 01:12:01,535
Repurpose that guy's unfortunately delusional

1439
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:06,143
Reality they're benign oil refineries that have been shut down or scaled back soon

1440
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:06,911
Pensacola Dam

1441
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:09,727
Pandemic began and most of them happened under Trump

1442
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:10,495
Presidency

1443
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:14,335
Another was damaged in Hurricane Ida and what had an explosion

1444
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,359
In 2019

1445
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:16,127
Still limiting its

1446
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:16,895
Capacity

1447
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:22,015
There's a confluent two variables that are affecting the situation with diesel but it's not going to run out in the middle of

1448
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:24,575
December and as time goes on the price will stabilize

1449
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:25,343
Imprint downward

1450
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:28,671
Note to self Alexandra's any connection to reality and if

1451
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:34,815
The did he wouldn't spend so much of his time covering this dumb Paul Pelosi story and you have no patience for screaming goats

1452
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:35,583
Inclimate horn

1453
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:38,911
Although that goes my favorite color in a long time

1454
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:40,191
It's ambitious

1455
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:41,215
It's somebody having

1456
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:41,983
Fun

1457
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,799
God damn it is like

1458
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,079
It is

1459
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:47,359
A

1460
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:48,639
That he said

1461
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:50,943
I am going to play this when I call

1462
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:51,967
He wasn't like

1463
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:55,551
Last minute you know it wasn't like a game-time decision like

1464
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:57,855
His fingers on the button and he has a moment of

1465
01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:04,255
CertainTeed screen lock my screen screaming goat

1466
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:06,047
You know it yeah

1467
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:08,095
Cuz you didn't have it wasn't a revised

1468
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:12,447
He didn't have other screaming things or another he's just got

1469
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:17,311
Call Doran and screaming goat Andy bevere didn't have to say it makes me want to scream

1470
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:22,687
But that wasn't a necessary, but I can made that comment so we can play the song

1471
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:23,455
Perfect love it

1472
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,735
Love it

1473
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:26,015
Guest

1474
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:41,375
One of my good friends

1475
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:47,263
Journalist

1476
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:51,871
He still able to break through I think he's probably had

1477
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:55,455
50 million views of his reports the last

1478
01:13:56,735 --> 01:14:02,879
Hernandez a little bit in the past he's one of the people I've collectively referred to as the baby reporters

1479
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:04,671
Sutro upon imports from time to time

1480
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:07,999
Along with like survey Savannah Hernandez and Patrick Howley

1481
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:14,911
They're people who give me a distinct Vibe of angry immaturity that's being enabled and boosted by Raelynn

1482
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:16,959
Media Outlets like Alex

1483
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:20,543
For Drew and Savannah that use Turning Point USA as well

1484
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:22,335
How we probably isn't welcome at

1485
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:24,383
Tpusa because of his moreover

1486
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:26,431
America First Association that almost

1487
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:27,967
Comical anti-semitism

1488
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:32,063
Who tried to start off his career with a veneer of respectability in journalist

1489
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:36,159
Pretense presenting himself as an undercover journalist and investigative reporter

1490
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:37,695
This was all dropped

1491
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:38,463
Pretty quick

1492
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:44,863
Became clear that he was just trying to go out and get footage of protest that he could use to make a antifa bait for the right-wing meme

1493
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:47,423
Stock and trade

1494
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:53,055
This culminated in him being a defense witness in the Kyle Rittenhouse trial which is a little bit weird

1495
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:54,591
Considering he was on the payroll

1496
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:58,175
Of the right-wing media Outlet right real America's voice

1497
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:58,943
Set the time

1498
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,735
And you didn't actually see the shootings

1499
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:07,391
He testified that the BLM and antifa people riding and then a few hours later he went on Tucker Carlson show to talk about

1500
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:08,671
Being a witness on the trial

1501
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:09,695
Just pretty classy

1502
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:11,743
I can't believe the people don't trust the America

1503
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:13,279
So weird

1504
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:19,423
Drew is essentially somebody who saw this success and profitability of what Andino was doing and got into the same Lane

1505
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:26,079
His work is meaningless and it's just meant to incite based on distorting reality with Selective editing and telling have stories

1506
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:28,127
Further he's intensely boring

1507
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:29,663
And he's not good at talking

1508
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:36,063
When I heard his name come up I almost turned this episode off but I decided to keep going only because Alex was still allegedly

1509
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:41,183
Taking calls and some of these weirdos are worth the time baby somebody else

1510
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:47,583
Where you're coming from

1511
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:49,375
And so

1512
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:50,655
What kind of assholes

1513
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:53,983
Looks at Andy now and it's like I can be a piece of s*** to

1514
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,007
Like that's crazy

1515
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:57,311
Thinking about

1516
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:59,359
How difficult to work is

1517
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:03,455
Maybe you get a milkshake thrown at you

1518
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:04,479
Or something

1519
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:06,527
And you get to make hay out of that.

1520
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:09,343
I'm saying easy work

1521
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,879
Lots of money

1522
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:16,255
It's hard to say no

1523
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:22,143
It's actually pretty attractive really I can't believe so many people get into like multi-level marketing

1524
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:25,471
6 games whenever what you could do is just be a giant piece of s*** online

1525
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:26,751
Yeah yeah

1526
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,799
Here's the problem

1527
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:31,359
There's only so many spots

1528
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:33,407
Really in that world true

1529
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:38,271
The bar for entry is really low like in terms of what requirements are necessary that

1530
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:41,087
Talent is not really all that important

1531
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:42,623
You don't have to really know much

1532
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:46,207
Right in a lot of people can do that so these pots are easy to

1533
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:46,975
To fill

1534
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:48,767
But

1535
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:51,327
There's a finite about a time on Tucker

1536
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:52,607
True people

1537
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:59,007
Getting called up to Carson's couch

1538
01:16:59,263 --> 01:16:59,775
Great

1539
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:04,383
And it doesn't you know without the monoculture you don't get catapulted into stardom overnight any

1540
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:05,407
Hot stuff

1541
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:06,431
It's tough I get it

1542
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:12,575
But they're still like even if you can't make yourself into like a really high level

1543
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:16,415
Person in this game a lot of money to be made on that

1544
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:19,231
Back on

1545
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:24,095
Yeah yeah yeah just getting on the talking point

1546
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:27,167
Turning Point USA the rotations

1547
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:29,727
Play Alexandra mad about alike

1548
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:32,799
2022

1549
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:34,335
Probably

1550
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:39,199
States of America a superpower

1551
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:39,967
For now

1552
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:42,271
Not conducting election

1553
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:44,063
Fairly and securely in

1554
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:45,599
Single day

1555
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:49,695
Central and Paramount

1556
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:51,743
Biden said last night

1557
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:55,583
We've always done it always takes days or longer

1558
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:57,887
No one know that didn't happen

1559
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:09,407
Machine

1560
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:10,687
Obvious

1561
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:12,223
That none of that's true.

1562
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:15,551
Full of s*** but also like doesn't through sound like a baby

1563
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,575
He really does

1564
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:19,391
He really does sound like he is a very annoying

1565
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:21,183
Is that reporting a suits

1566
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:23,231
Just a little too big

1567
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:26,303
Phenomenon

1568
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:28,607
What is feeling

1569
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:31,679
And it's because of the way I mean it's at least eight

1570
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:32,959
Partially

1571
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:36,799
Contributed to by social media the way that everybody's

1572
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:38,591
Clamoring for information

1573
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:42,431
And the way that the media now covers these elections like

1574
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:46,783
Kinds of influences make it

1575
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:49,343
Feel like we should have things immediately

1576
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:51,391
And it distorts your

1577
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:53,695
Memories of how things were in the past

1578
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:55,999
Pretty regular for elections

1579
01:18:56,255 --> 01:19:00,351
To not really be fully counted until the next day or days later

1580
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:02,655
Nothing to do with

1581
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:06,751
That the electronic Mists of it

1582
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:09,567
Because if you're if you're going to make that argument

1583
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:10,847
We saw Brazil

1584
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:14,175
Just head doing an election overnight

1585
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:17,247
Right so if you're complaining about that then just say

1586
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:19,551
Let's change it to do what somebody else does

1587
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:20,831
Instead of being like

1588
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:23,135
Wow this country is over I think we should do fast

1589
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:27,743
Sure

1590
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:31,839
I guess I was going to say hostile party

1591
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:36,703
Partisanship also plays a role but that exists in Brazil to

1592
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:39,775
Why we can't do that now because hostile partisan

1593
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:40,543
Gunship wasn't

1594
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:44,383
Bad enough whenever they started the that you don't put on chip was

1595
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:45,407
But former dictator

1596
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:47,199
Back then so yeah

1597
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:48,479
Hear it like

1598
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:53,599
You have tons of people who just like you can't concede any

1599
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:57,183
Like races that would probably been conceded 30 years ago

1600
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:59,231
Or never concede it now

1601
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:00,767
There is such

1602
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:02,047
Polarisation

1603
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:04,607
Many races are fairly close

1604
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:06,399
Yeah and

1605
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:08,447
These things to contribute to how

1606
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:09,471
Voting ghost

1607
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:10,239
Also

1608
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:12,031
Apps

1609
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:12,799
70 ballot

1610
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:16,640
Hi there can be certification of those or no

1611
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:20,992
There's three there's a lot of stuff that aren't real

1612
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:22,272
Factors

1613
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:25,344
It's just a way of invalidating

1614
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:29,696
And I mean literally the only time in my lifetime that I

1615
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:31,744
The only time I can think of it

1616
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:35,072
The past hundred years that election was actually stolen it was

1617
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:37,120
The same way that the other election

1618
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:38,144
Since I've been sold which is

1619
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:44,800
The Supreme Court or a bunch of rich white dude got together and we're like here's what we'll do. This time how about you get

1620
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:48,384
One and I get one and we called today took a long time

1621
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:49,920
Took a long time

1622
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:51,456
To steal that election

1623
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,760
Thanks Rodger

1624
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:55,552
Anyway Drew

1625
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:57,600
So they

1626
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:00,160
Talk a little bit more about Dubai

1627
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,976
Comments about how it will take awhile

1628
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:03,744
Account

1629
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:09,120
Andrew gets pretty mad about this

1630
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:12,192
How do we stop their surroundings and I put a sold in Hernandez

1631
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:16,032
I mean in the purse

1632
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,360
Propaganda right number one

1633
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:21,664
Is higher more intellectual

1634
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:26,784
These people come out and they say what they're going to do before they do it

1635
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:29,344
Because number one for the sake of

1636
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:30,368
Ganda

1637
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:31,648
Because they need to put

1638
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:34,208
Narrative

1639
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:38,304
Literally jailing the true

1640
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:42,400
Behind the movie

1641
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:44,448
Poster geo-tracking

1642
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:46,240
What was going on during 2020

1643
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:47,520
How convenient

1644
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:49,056
They're shutting them down

1645
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:52,640
Turn all kinds of people on social media while at the same time

1646
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,944
Geniusly

1647
01:21:57,248 --> 01:21:57,760
People to accept

1648
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:01,344
Midterm is going to take days

1649
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,696
To come to a conclusion because they need to

1650
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:11,840
Because there are millions of people in this country not the viewers

1651
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:14,144
Idiot

1652
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:15,936
Who

1653
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,240
They say is Gospel number one

1654
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:19,776
Number two

1655
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:25,664
Because they view themselves more powerful more greater

1656
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:28,992
Their word is literally God

1657
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:31,552
Call James

1658
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:32,832
Whatever they say

1659
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:33,856
Goes in the future

1660
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:39,232
Disguise one of the best talk show host that is your addition I'm sending you back to the mine

1661
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:41,024
You know ya like that

1662
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:45,376
You're not good at getting angry I see some potential there

1663
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:47,168
You know

1664
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:48,448
Hazlet

1665
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:49,216
Confidence

1666
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:55,872
That's true and that takes that's more than you can't teach that you really can't

1667
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:58,944
I know it is I'm in Alex

1668
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,736
Position I find that a little admirable

1669
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:02,272
But yeah he's swinging

1670
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:03,296
Is bad

1671
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:04,832
He doesn't have a good arm

1672
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:09,184
Sounds like an angry baby can't run for s***

1673
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:11,232
Yeah I don't think

1674
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:17,632
Picking up like half of the word

1675
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:18,400
Finger though it's

1676
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:26,080
These guys are doing things it doesn't feel rooted in any prints

1677
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:27,104
Sapore meaning

1678
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:33,248
It's really weird because he's whiffing a lot of words and whipping a lot of like

1679
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:34,528
Phrasing

1680
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,832
But it doesn't feel like nerves

1681
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:40,160
It's not like hey I'm in the big leagues here or anything

1682
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:43,488
Now you just doesn't have it

1683
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,096
I mean you know baby if he has another 10 years to work on s*** but but maybe

1684
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:49,120
He's just a

1685
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:50,912
Exhausted from doing a lot of hard work

1686
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:52,704
It discusses

1687
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,848
Barack Obama's rally last night in Phoenix

1688
01:23:59,104 --> 01:23:59,872
Before I trolled him

1689
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:02,176
One thing that I heard continually

1690
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,480
Instantly throughout all the

1691
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:05,248
Candidates

1692
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:08,576
You're making mail-in voting some kind of trendy thing

1693
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,112
Cringe

1694
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:11,648
The same time because

1695
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:12,672
This is so stupid

1696
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:13,696
IQ

1697
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,000
Just believe whatever they say

1698
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:19,328
He's made a mail-in voting like some kind of new tech

1699
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:20,864
Trendy thing

1700
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:23,424
Just be apart of in doing

1701
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:28,800
It's really weird how they've done that

1702
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:33,920
Cute pools about that can grab a manipulator

1703
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:35,456
I know exactly what they're doing

1704
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:37,760
Play

1705
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:39,552
On people's laziness

1706
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:41,088
Play on people's

1707
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:43,904
Low IQ because they're naive

1708
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:47,744
Could you didn't roll Obama

1709
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:54,144
That Obama's speaking at an Arizona any wouldn't stop yelling while speaking

1710
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,168
We got kicked out of the event

1711
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:59,264
While Obama told him he needed to be polite and that if you wanted to speak so bad he's

1712
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,288
Should set up his own rally

1713
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:07,200
You got some attention for that but unfortunately didn't get invited to go on Tucker to talk about how his Free Speech was stifled and that proves that Obama

1714
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:10,784
But better luck next time maybe it'll work out is this

1715
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,600
Is what we called journalist

1716
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:15,904
Dummy text

1717
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:16,928
That's just this

1718
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:17,952
Business model

1719
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:18,976
You know

1720
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:21,792
That's what he does he goes to it like an event it like

1721
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:22,816
Basically

1722
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:24,864
If This Were the past

1723
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,168
He would have been the person who is in Alex's

1724
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:28,960
Yo Bill Clinton's a rapist Toronto

1725
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:30,240
Yep you know that

1726
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:32,800
That's the that's the level of work that he's doing

1727
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:34,592
Sedalia Kansas

1728
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:35,616
Amanda

1729
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:36,640
It is what it is

1730
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:37,408
Hi

1731
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:38,432
Just

1732
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:40,992
You can't be a you can't be enough

1733
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:41,760
TNT cringe

1734
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:43,296
You can't be a Nazi and be like

1735
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:46,112
It's very cringe like now you're a fascist

1736
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:46,880
Come on man

1737
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:47,648
Stop this

1738
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:48,416
I think

1739
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:50,464
That it sounds a little cringey to call things

1740
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:52,512
Like voting

1741
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:57,120
I understand that

1742
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:58,144
Aged out

1743
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,680
Of slang

1744
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:02,496
It's hard for me to judge

1745
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:06,080
Too much but he's from another generation

1746
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:09,152
I understand but I can't handle Tik Tok face

1747
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:14,016
Can't do this like you're going to have to dances

1748
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:16,576
I don't want anybody being like Oh

1749
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:22,976
Oligarchies on fleek like I don't need any of this s*** you know I can't we have them use my b

1750
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:24,256
Come on

1751
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:31,424
Sorry was the first word that popped into my head

1752
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,728
Should I reveal

1753
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:38,336
This is private I don't know if it'll put you on blast here

1754
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:40,896
You do respond to some tax

1755
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:44,992
Should I send you with cool beans I do I love say cool beans till I die

1756
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:49,344
That'll never go out of style my man

1757
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:52,416
I thought cool beans all the way back from

1758
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:54,208
Simpsons in the 90s bad

1759
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:56,256
I remember people at

1760
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:57,024
K-life

1761
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,328
When I was in church saying cool beans

1762
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:04,448
When I was like 14 minutes are all I know

1763
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:05,216
Could be from the

1764
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:06,240
Morty's

1765
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,800
So do I pull Watchers

1766
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:10,080
The mule

1767
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:11,872
Come back up

1768
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:13,664
And Alex Andrew love

1769
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:15,456
The narrative

1770
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:20,320
Because it's going to become a mainstream narrative things here and there

1771
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:21,600
The kind of test it out

1772
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:23,136
The public

1773
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:24,928
Stupid people in the Mindless

1774
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,208
To believe this stuff

1775
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:27,232
And I'm telling you

1776
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:29,536
Force

1777
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:33,888
This will be coming in on Monday

1778
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,960
Jailed indicted

1779
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:37,984
Canceled

1780
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:38,752
Target

1781
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:43,360
Three-letter agencies declared a domestic

1782
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:47,200
Chrissy

1783
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:50,272
It doesn't matter

1784
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:53,344
Whether you're on the right or the left this is what the left doesn't understand

1785
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:55,904
Care about your voter process

1786
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,696
And you show up watching a ballet

1787
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:01,792
Accuse you of being Adam

1788
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:05,376
Democracy

1789
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:07,168
It's not about left or right

1790
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:10,752
Control all of us

1791
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:12,544
Globalist and Satanist

1792
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:13,824
Real

1793
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:15,616
How to control elections

1794
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:17,152
Because they want to control the pain

1795
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,712
We have no democracy

1796
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:26,112
Democracy democracy democracy democracy

1797
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:30,720
What about Bill Gates

1798
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:34,560
Making decisions on behalf of the United States of America in

1799
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:38,656
On foreign soil what about that is that Democratic

1800
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:43,264
All these Democrats are in

1801
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:47,360
Globalist

1802
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:50,176
Some right-wing rhinos are as well

1803
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:54,528
Right

1804
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:57,088
Economics

1805
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,392
Public right now

1806
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:02,464
It needs to be a

1807
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:04,768
.

1808
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:09,888
Oh man so that's that's an example of the like you can't

1809
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:11,168
You can't do the yelling

1810
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:12,704
Saying yeah it's

1811
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:15,264
Alex

1812
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:16,800
It's like aha

1813
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:18,080
It's false

1814
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:21,664
But at the same time feels right this dude yelling

1815
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,712
If you want to respond to like calm down

1816
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:26,016
Call Mom Dad

1817
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:32,160
Call Bella

1818
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:34,720
This'll pass

1819
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:41,120
He's just having a little bit of a flourish when you try

1820
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:47,264
I feel like he is sitting on top of another him

1821
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,544
Wearing a trench

1822
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,848
And that's how they're doing this year

1823
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:55,968
Baby reporter has a really good illustration of why I called this guy babe

1824
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:03,648
Alice's the situation of the relationship between the world economic forum and the government is non-existent is known as

1825
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:06,208
He knows he's supposed to be mad about this

1826
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:09,280
Stopping at these people because that's what the right-wing media audience

1827
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:10,816
Eats up so he does it

1828
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:13,888
It's performative outrage and there's nothing really behind it

1829
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:20,544
Even tripped himself up about the whole idea that we have no democracy at the end there because he knows that he needs to direct

1830
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,360
This exciting Outburst into partisan

1831
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:30,272
It's not that there's no democracy in the country it's that the Democrats and the Republicans that I don't like her puppets of the world economic forum

1832
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:35,136
This kind of destroy the whole premise that there's no democracy because if you were able to get this

1833
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:37,952
Support you could unseat those Democrats and bad Republicans

1834
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:41,024
And only elect people who are hostile to Klaus Schwab

1835
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:45,888
It doesn't matter that he's basically contradicting himself in the course of a minute

1836
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:48,192
The actual things he's saying don't really mean any

1837
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,240
It's about a listening animotion

1838
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:54,592
No response and then directing those emotions into negative feelings towards your political Adam

1839
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:58,688
It's something Alex does a bit better and less transparently than Drew

1840
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,760
Which was young and also has no discernible conviction

1841
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:05,344
Past getting attention so it makes sense that Alex would be better at

1842
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:06,112
Yeah

1843
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:08,416
Also poll watching is totally fine

1844
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:11,232
There tons of people Watchers who operate within accepted

1845
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:12,000
Guidelines

1846
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:14,304
What's not okay is voter intimidation

1847
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,096
Which is what Drew and Alex are Defender

1848
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:18,400
This is become popular

1849
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:20,704
Analysis crewsense at least 2015

1850
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:25,312
But wasn't much of an issue before that because he didn't really have strong convictions about presidential candidate

1851
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:28,896
Never made it out of a primary so it never really was an issue

1852
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:35,808
In the lead-up to the 2016 election Larry Nichols was on the show stressing the need for armed groups to be outside every polling play

1853
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:37,856
Place any effort organized around this

1854
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:44,000
Id2020 these ideas continue to circulate heavily and write with median Rodger Stone made

1855
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:45,024
Some pushes and back

1856
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,304
The original stop this

1857
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:47,072
Steal ideas

1858
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:48,096
Hello

1859
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:50,656
Clearly these were not attempt

1860
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:51,936
To defend Alexa

1861
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:52,704
Integrity

1862
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:55,776
They were spindly disguised motivation

1863
01:31:56,032 --> 01:31:58,080
How to make people scared to vote

1864
01:31:58,848 --> 01:32:01,152
The cycle because of course it is

1865
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:06,272
Hit Mesa Arizona armed individuals with their faces covered we're seeing patrolling

1866
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:12,672
Leading to a humpback group called clean elections USA being ordered by the court to stay at least 75

1867
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:13,952
From drop boxes

1868
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:15,744
And ordered not to follow or

1869
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:16,768
Speak to voters

1870
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,304
This is because they were doing

1871
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:22,400
Reuters reported people watching them from hiding in bushes

1872
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:23,168
People watching

1873
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:24,192
Binoculars

1874
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:26,752
And even taking photos of Voters lice

1875
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:27,520
Templates

1876
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:30,080
One voter reported to the doj quote

1877
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:32,640
I've never been more intimidated in my life

1878
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:33,408
Trying to vote

1879
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:36,224
This is the behavior that Alexandra running

1880
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:36,992
Cover for it

1881
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:38,784
This is what they want to see more of

1882
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:40,576
And here's the thing

1883
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:43,904
I totally understand the Vigilantes doing this voter intimidation

1884
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:50,560
If they truly believe the b******* that folks like Alex and Drew yellow but day after day why wouldn't they harass people at the

1885
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:51,584
Pools in Ballard

1886
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:55,424
They have to believe that the election is being stolen

1887
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:58,752
To not do something like what they're doing would be to let that

1888
01:32:59,008 --> 01:32:59,520
Happen

1889
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:01,568
These people are wrong and what they're doing is

1890
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:06,688
Is horrible but it's the natural conclusion of the rhetoric italics in Tucker use everyday

1891
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:09,760
You believe the things that these demagogue say

1892
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:11,552
These actions make total sense

1893
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:12,832
This is the problem

1894
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:17,184
If you believe that say somebody a Super Evil

1895
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:19,232
Acting without any cons

1896
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:21,536
And there's no one who will hold them account

1897
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:24,864
Maybe you think the only way to do it is to go to their house

1898
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:26,912
And smash their f****** kneecap

1899
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:29,216
You know like these are things that make

1900
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:29,984
Sense

1901
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,264
It's just insane

1902
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:32,544
It's just in

1903
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,848
Senior

1904
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:40,736
Because I grew bored of

1905
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:43,040
This baby

1906
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:45,344
Two calls for a while and by that time the

1907
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,880
The charm of the guy with the

1908
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:48,928
Clown horn to head kind of worn off

1909
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:52,256
Yeah listening to him wine is really taking the the sales out of that

1910
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:55,328
Clown horn about the devil

1911
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:00,960
Controlled demolition from with

1912
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:03,520
Of our society and the number one

1913
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:09,920
Democracy or a constitutional republic or anything

1914
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:10,944
Functioning

1915
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:12,480
A group of

1916
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:13,760
People on planet Earth

1917
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:14,784
Money is a

1918
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:18,880
Voice of the people

1919
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:20,160
And when you begin to stop

1920
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:23,744
Is taking away the voice of the people

1921
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,536
These people know that

1922
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:29,632
This is how it works

1923
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:33,728
Countries that are communist

1924
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:37,568
They know that the only way to truly take away power from the people

1925
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:39,616
Is the take away their vote

1926
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:42,688
Also voice

1927
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:44,224
Censorship

1928
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:45,760
Election meddling

1929
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:48,576
Go hand and hand

1930
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:50,368
Totalitarian regime

1931
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:52,160
Because those two things

1932
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:53,184
Need to be

1933
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:56,256
In order to have a

1934
01:34:56,512 --> 01:34:58,048
Healthy Society or

1935
01:34:58,304 --> 01:34:59,840
A healthy group of people here on play

1936
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,400
Globalist these people

1937
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:03,168
They know this

1938
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:04,960
Because they're all energized by

1939
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:06,240
Satan and Lucifer

1940
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:08,032
What I mean by that

1941
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:09,056
Is Lucifer

1942
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:11,616
Has been around longer than us

1943
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:13,664
For a very long

1944
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:16,224
Chicago Behavior

1945
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:20,320
Study

1946
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:23,136
Manipulate human emotion

1947
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:25,184
Study how to manipulate Society

1948
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:28,256
To do his bidding to get into the palm of his hand

1949
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:29,792
Human beings

1950
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:32,096
To do what he wants

1951
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:35,168
This is why we see the same reoccurring agenda

1952
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:41,312
Text Jordan you look a little bit frustrated and I don't understand why cuz this guy is spitting Hot Fire

1953
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:42,336
You understand

1954
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:43,104
Set the devil

1955
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:44,384
It's been around for a long time

1956
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:45,664
You been studying people

1957
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,200
And what he's come to the conclusion

1958
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:49,760
Is that an order to destroy Society

1959
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:51,296
You have to get rid of Elections

1960
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:54,112
And kick people off so I just

1961
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:59,744
I just have never heard someone that dumb you know what the really work

1962
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:00,512
Shadowbanned

1963
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:02,048
Ask you a question

1964
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:04,864
If you've got an ultimate Evil

1965
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:05,888
Alright

1966
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:07,168
Strongest evil

1967
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:13,568
Second only to God and Lucifer Unholy Duo

1968
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:14,848
Holy Trinity

1969
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:21,248
Beelzebub

1970
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:27,392
Wife

1971
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:29,696
Yeah I don't I don't idiot are you

1972
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:31,232
I don't

1973
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:32,000
Oh man

1974
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:33,280
I feel

1975
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:38,912
It wouldn't take that long if you're the devil to figure out like how to push buttons

1976
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:44,800
In early Humanity the devil was like hey maybe if I give people candy they'll do what

1977
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:49,152
The devil was still formulating a lot of these ideas because social media didn't exist

1978
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:51,200
I'm so

1979
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:57,344
If his argument is that the only way social media could exist as if there was the devil

1980
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,648
I might believe that was not the argument

1981
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:06,048
Self is good but shadowbanning is the work of the town

1982
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:10,400
I am definitely going to include Uncle howdy

1983
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:15,264
Uncle howdy

1984
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:21,664
This dude is a disaster

1985
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,456
Alex wanting to hire him

1986
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:25,760
But he already has a thing with Turning Point

1987
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:26,528
Feel like

1988
01:37:26,784 --> 01:37:27,808
I can't see him

1989
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:29,344
Attaching himself to Alec

1990
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:30,368
Anything other than

1991
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:31,904
Like greater attention

1992
