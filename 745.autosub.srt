1
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:29,696
College bike I'm sick of them posing as if through the good guy or the bad guy

2
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:42,496
Money

3
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:55,296
So Alex

4
00:00:55,552 --> 00:01:01,696
Dot-com

5
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:08,096
Little bit about Alex

6
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:17,568
My bright spot today Jordan as well we're recording this on Tuesday and that means that as we were

7
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:23,968
Recording I don't have to be watching Alex his livestream that I am drawn to like a moth to a flame

8
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:30,368
No but seriously my right spot is cereal again I mentioned

9
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:36,768
Sing into cereals

10
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:42,912
Some that have been a little bit off the wall the frosty cereal the Wendy's frosty cereal brands

11
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,680
Yeah

12
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,448
That's pretty good

13
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:50,848
Really that's amazing I think a free

14
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:57,248
Frosted Flakes strawberry milkshake flavor cheesus Christ not good out of control

15
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:02,880
Flavors are out of control until I got one that was a Prix

16
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:07,488
But it's like I guess sort of Jurassic Park theme there something special marshmallows

17
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:13,888
Okay it's tricks but with marshmallows that are also dinosaurs

18
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:17,472
Is putting marshmallows in their cereal anyway there's inappropriate

19
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,752
I'm waiting for like

20
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,776
I don't know

21
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:23,616
Kicks through marshmallows in or Smacks

22
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:34,880
King vitamin

23
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:41,280
Just won't stop putting marshmallows in the granola aisle next week and there's going to be Uncharted are leaving everything

24
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:45,888
Yeah you're probably right I couldn't resist trying this I'd forgotten the trick sucks

25
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:52,288
It's not a good cereal even in that fruit to the world better

26
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,056
Also

27
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:53,824
I was

28
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,616
Thinking about it

29
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,640
I hate tricks

30
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:03,040
I hate the idea of an abusive cereal the whole marketing campaign is it

31
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:06,112
But excluding this water rabbit feel like

32
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:12,000
You are accidentally proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that Trix are for kids

33
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:18,400
Right because you're you're an adult man and you find them wrong I find it orally

34
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,728
If I do not get to think about yes

35
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:27,872
To f*** a trick sucks tricks aren't even making that pronouncement

36
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:34,272
Now honeycomb but with marshmallows the f*** out of here

37
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:40,672
My bright spot is I got to hang out and see my old friend Leah bourbon last

38
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:46,816
Last night and we were talking and

39
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,096
Catching up

40
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:52,448
Oh old old timey style I found out two things

41
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:58,848
One Kelly Clarkson has a TV show into Lieberman was on it baby

42
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:05,248
Right on Twitter or something

43
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:10,880
I mean I already knew Kelly Clarkson had a show I did not know that but yeah I saw that she and some other folks were on it

44
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,928
Fantastic hanging out with

45
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:19,327
F****** Leno is 8000 years old now I mean a used to be salt

46
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,911
I'm pepper and now his face is white you know like the whole thing

47
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,447
Taken care of

48
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:30,847
But isn't that really cool yeah it's really cool I was trying to think of a Kelly Clarkson song

49
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:37,503
A Moment Like That

50
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,063
Kelly Clarkson

51
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:46,463
Behind These Hazel Eyes live a great song man

52
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,559
Jordan's Pizza is Captain II Capitan

53
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,607
Thought you were the one

54
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:59,007
Open up deep inside but you don't get to see the tears I cry alright

55
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,287
Hazel eyes

56
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:06,175
Damn that was Kelly Clarkson so I don't hook up

57
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:12,575
Willmar Kelly Clarkson when did your 90s hit

58
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,903

I love the a lot of Pop along with my hip hop stop

60
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:27,935
Fun fact about Kelly Clarkson what that for kids yeah I watched one episode of the first season of American Idol

61
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:34,335
I turned it on so I Kelly Clarkson like that's the winter baby I was right

62
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,383
That's nice call Liz ice

63
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,783
I think I am not sure I watched one episode of another season I think I might have called that one

64
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,319
One of the later run

65
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:50,719
Bo Bice remove remember watching it but yeah Kelly Clarkson was clearly the person

66
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,999
Who had like

67
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,559
That thing whatever you know what it is

68
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,351

00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:02,751
Their star power Star Quality quality

72
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:14,271

Sixth anniversary objects

The General

110
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,551

00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,367
Cuz of the 5th anniversary traditionally is wood

112
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,647

Apna Bazar GIF disappointing I feel like it's it should be weird text stuff as it goes on

121
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:36,511

The dildo anniversary where you're like working at experiment you know it's getting weird anniversary

00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,711
For that to be

196
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,015
Sliced and broadcasting your website right

197
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,855
Hopefully the color splicing

198
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:52,255
Okay well this is just like a guy falling down

199
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:58,655
Like a hill and getting every Rock on the way down

200
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,727
Yeah I guess it is

201
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:08,127
Your team is right they could have looked it up I do they all went home you time to shoot a video didn't you

00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:17,087
Created I appreciated his

204
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,135
Commitment to not letting up

205
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:22,463
Like not one second is it just going to be

206
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,487
Fight milk

207
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:30,143
Note you explain every moment of your day yesterday and when you lie to me I'm going to tell you what I saw I was there

208
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,727
If you're Alex you can't Reliant

209
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:39,615
Question 1 you know right here you can't you can't get on your back foot because then if you do

210
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:46,271
Do you open up kicking his ass and then he knows I'm not going to

211
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,039
Have a good day

212
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:53,439
Video together because he had to camera people with him

213
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,719
Your two cameramen

214
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,487
Shooting at

215
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,535
Wtsb us who were they

216
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,631
It was a

217
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,911
RAB do

218
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,215
And it was a race

219
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,055
Why'd you bring Rob do with you

220
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,103
Consultant

221
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,127
And

222
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,015
If you just said something sometime for this Radu was another one of your employees who

223
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,063
Claimed that senior

224
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,343
The hoax correct yes

225
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,647
And you cast rod do

226
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,695
About those emails and record showing

227
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,975
Schools closed

228
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:28,767
Did you ask him

229
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,583
Even make any effort at all to get those

230
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,351
Record email

231
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:37,983
I actually did a little bit myself. We were able to find some of the stuff you asked for but not that particular thing

232
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:41,311
Are you claiming that you yourself personally did something

233
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,615
Locate the emails and records showing that Cindy

234
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,383
Schools closed

235
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,407
Yes what did you do

236
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,479
I

237
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,271
Center at dinner

238
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,831
With the Robin and I

239
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:57,951
Didn't got to locate that we did some long Michaels around confided in late like last time

240
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,535
Yeah that's that's quite a bit of work he did

241
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:07,935
I sat there a dinner and I told Rob Leslie happiness we got to get this done buddy

242
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:14,335
This is got to happen alright it's fascinating to see this kind of like the way he's articulating it's because he's

243
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:18,431
Put any effort into finding a cuz he knows that this doesn't exist

244
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:22,271
Isn't a real thing again so why waste your time with that Beast

245
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:26,367
He still has to pretend like we put it to work drive by it's a real thing

246
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:30,207
It is it is a bit like

247
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:36,607
You know that his childhood was different because I remember if I was trying to lie about how I didn't do something

248
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,399
Second grade teacher

249
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,959
They saw me coming to my way

250
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,007
Because I was 7 years old right

251
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:47,103
And he is still seven years old and somehow he's just going to keep going

252
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:50,431
You don't like what I was trying to line second-grade eventually I'll be like you know what

253
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:57,599
Well I think a teacher has a little bit more limited time until one of us all day

254
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:03,999
Position cuz you're going to end up saying

255
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:09,119
Something that contradicts yourself or he went from teacher the principal de psychiatrist

256
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:15,775
So we know that Rob do long for the trip Rob to Uncle also

257
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:22,175
Was in Newtown for that Wolfgang halbig press conference went to

258
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:26,783
Alex is asked whether or not he actually spoke to Rob dudes uncle

259
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,135
And it's weird he seems to not know for sure do not know I don't know

260
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,927
I want to

261
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,463
Go back

262
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,327
The video that we

263
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,399
Today

264
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:43,935
The end of the day

265
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,031
The video that you titled retired FBI agent

266
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:48,799
It investigates

267
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,823
Sandy Hook Megan

268
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,359
Remember that

269
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
Yes

270
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
In

271
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,967
That retired FBI agent

272
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,015
Was John dueker I guess you never spoken

273
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,671
I may have talked to Mother phone before

274
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,999
You just wanted you don't know whether to remember

275
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,095
And you don't

276
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,191
Any idea

277
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:20,287
What is anything he did to investigate Sandy Hook other than showing up at that

278
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,823
Freedom of Information commission hearing

279
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,591
Correct

280
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,359
Yes

281
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,967
And you had no further conversations with Rob do

282
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,735
About

283
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,807
What is Uncle may or may not have done related to Sandy Hook

284
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,599
I have a conversation with you

285
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,367
You have

286
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,903
Went with Osiris

287
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,719
Over the years again last night I was

288
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,023
Are you asking about a we ought to try to get

289
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,303
Talk to him about what

290
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,655
Tallahassee more about what specifically said

291
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,935
Repeat the same thing

292
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,471
They never seen

293
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,263
Government people so tight-lipped

294
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,055
And it's so not willing to talk about anything

295
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,615
This is what robbed you said to you last night

296
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,407
That his uncle I said to him

297
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,503
Spokane news

298
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,855
As of today

299
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
A recent

300
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,183
Did Rob do lesbians

301
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,767
He actually said he recently talked to him

302
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,535
About Cindy

303
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,607
No he just said oh yeah I just talked to him today he's doing great

304
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,935
Did he indicate

305
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,703
That

306
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,239
My office had reached out to him

307
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,287
No

308
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,823
So that that Radu to

309
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,591
Didn't share with you

310
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:30,943
No you just said how is your uncle and said he's fine just talked to me today

311
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:37,343
So if you're Alex you got to be a little bit confused by that because

312
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:43,743
They reached out to Rob dudes Uncle communicated by Rob to Ally

313
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,047
This could mean

314
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,863
That the plaintiff's office had spoken

315
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:55,263
To Uncle do or it could mean Uncle do is avoided Fab

316
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,127
And Alex should probably say I don't know I haven't talked to you in awhile I don't have no information about this

317
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,687
Either either Prospect isn't really great

318
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:09,087
Optically here be like

319
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:15,487
Episode about this

320
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:22,143
People of course I can't remember

321
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:25,471
The last time I talked to Rob buza Uncle because last night I said

322
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,751
Hey guys

323
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:31,615
Let's Pretend he doesn't exist and get him out of the country you can't talk to anybody

324
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:35,199
Why would I tell you that I'm committing witness tampering

325
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:42,111
Rob his uncle actually only speak Klingon now so I am not going to be able to listen

326
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:48,767
We're the ones who are really hurt by him only speaking Klingon remember the last time we got together for a family dinner didn't

327
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,327
Said a word about anything so you think you're mad

328
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:58,495
So the questions obviously at towards the end of day one head to do

329
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,287
A Dandy

330
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:04,383
You know the Kraken is really Central to a lot of this

331
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:08,991
A time so this is explored a little bit more here like

332
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:13,343
Let's get let's get into some of the Dynamics of how batondy was doing what he did

333
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:17,696
In the next month in July 2015

334
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,976
To be with mr. Hale

335
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
Call the Great

336
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,632
I know he wanted for some I don't remember when or how

337
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:30,240
But I'm saying you know that after that June hearing that we saw yesterday

338
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,312
You then set him up to Connecticut again

339
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:36,896
To report for Infowars correct or whatever

340
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,200
Enterprise near me

341
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,504
So to clarify just really quick

342
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,904
The hearing month prior that is being referred to is the one where robbed is uncle

343
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,744
Was there and where he was yelling at people in Alex

344
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,144
And they wanted his testimony said I saw that and f*** this right

345
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,704
No more so this is a month after that

346
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,008
We pull up exhibit number

347
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:03,776

348
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:18,112

Telling dhanbad on D2 live stream

360
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:51,136
Is coverage of the album hearing to The Alex Jones

361
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:51,904
Channel

362
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,232
And of course

363
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,000
Mystery

364
00:22:56,512 --> 00:23:00,352
YouTube channels

365
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,424
Unless he was reporting for Infowars right

366
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,192
Yes

367
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,080
I told you I remember when and how I was following this Robin's running

368
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:18,784
And we just saw not putting any responsibility off on a ride I was telling you I don't remember all this right

369
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,136
Right but at least we can agree having seen this email that as of this time mr. Metate

370
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:29,536
Was still working as a reporter friend for trade you showed me this yesterday I would have said that that that all my God I now cannot deny this

371
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,472
I do feel like

372
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:43,104
I do feel like a dinner we've clearly discuss the strategy of skipping from the like

373
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,504
I'll just deny something and then watch them play the video to Alex being like I don't remember are you going to play the video

374
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:56,672
There are a couple points where does that but he does have the same like

375
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:59,488
X words

376
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,024
Maddie is using

377
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:05,632
Very specific terms and if you're Alex and you hear those terms

378
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:12,032
And the way the crescents being phrases like I'm just about to get hit with the video of me saying that,

379
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:16,896
He doesn't seem to see it coming sometimes

380
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,456
So if you ask him did you say something like

381
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:25,856
Crazy aliens are coming to kill everybody and he's like never heard of that with an obviously you're going to play the clip of him saying

382
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,904
Crazy alien everybody

383
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,232
You just came to smell those traps sometimes

384
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:37,632
So Alex tries to play a little wiggle game here with Abaddon D and the timing of firing him

385
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:40,960
Does not work of course.

386
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,752
Padatti to go up there on your behalf

387
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,360
Earlier I guess it is your news director did here

388
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:50,432
Right on it was a sometime I saw him yelling at people

389
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,784
And I said that's horrible and I don't like that and tell him stop

390
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,600
Then I don't use them anymore and I just that's what I remember

391
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:02,720
Recording

392
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,792
He's doing better or whatever that's my bad memory

393
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,072
I'm being honest with you

394
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,376
Remember

395
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,008
I just want to make sure I understand this is

396
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:15,776
Are you

397
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,568
You seem to be saying

398
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,872
On the one hand you're speculating

399
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,408
On the other hand

400
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:25,248
You know you have a vague memory of it

401
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,808
Cuz I think you're anticipating me and I appreciate it

402
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,392
I take it that your testimony is

403
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,184
That although at some point

404
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:36,000
You believe you instructed people who work for you

405
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,536
The damn bar.

406
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,072
Should no longer be used

407
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,352
You don't know when you do

408
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,376
Is that fair

409
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,680
Yes

410
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,472
And you don't know why you did

411
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,800
No I do I told you it's because of what he was doing

412
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:51,872
Vanessa Rob said last night I said when did I say

413
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,152
Stop using it

414
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,712
They said when he went to those events

415
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,736
All the people

416
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:02,368
That's what he remembers as well and are you going to talk to him he can tell you about it but that's that's what the best I remember okay

417
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:08,000
Robinwood Dental he's exactly the same thing that I

418
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:12,608
I do like all the documents and all the evidence has gone for Alex to just being like

419
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,424
Rob do agreed with me at dinner last night yeah that's

420
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,216
Do you need more proof

421
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:23,616
You know in my culture dinner is sworn testimony

422
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:27,712
Create Community you cannot lie a dinner break bread with them and you share salt

423
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,272
You cannot lie to him

424
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,064
File case closed

425
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,160
So Alex seems to be trying to

426
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,488
I don't know if it's intentional or if he just doesn't understand

427
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,144
The video that was streamed on Alex's channel was the second time

428
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,216
Pictures after the video of badani yelling at people

429
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:55,616
Alex seems to want to make it the first one because it looks better

430
00:26:55,872 --> 00:27:02,016
Left guilty several years difference does not look good and took Maddie is trying to

431
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:07,392
To explain to him this is the second one you didn't I don't know if he'll just picking up on it

432
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,928
We have text message

433
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,464
I'm going to show you shortly

434
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,000
In 2016

435
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,560
In which your staff is

436
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,584
At that time

437
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,120
Going dammit.

438
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,656
Daddy should no longer rap

439
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,424
A dead himself

440
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,728
In 2016

441
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,520
I don't want on for awhile well

442
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,056
It seems as though

443
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:30,688
You had the footage from a month before this hearing in July in which Mr bidani was a costing peep

444
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,224
Slater

445
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,528
You have permission to livestream

446
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,832
Similar hearing over your YouTube channel

447
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,904
So it probably wasn't after you saw that footage right

448
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:44,256
No I never I was saying remember getting upset that he still kept

449
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,560
Popping up there and then I remember

450
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,864
Rob said he's not officially working with us now

451
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,448
You know he's just adjust Paisley phone sorry for him

452
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,496
It's not good I've already said that

453
00:27:55,008 --> 00:28:01,152
You gave damn bhadoti access to livestream material to millions of people over your YouTube channel

454
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:03,456
Felt sorry for him.

455
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,272
By this time I'm reserved

456
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:12,672
Like I said I thought Rob you was that event that's how my memory is all messed up on this

457
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:16,768
Testify under oath if your memories all messed up

458
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,792
So

459
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:24,192
Alex is trying to sort of change the subject I didn't like I need to correct something about that I said about Rob being there

460
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:27,008
Is a good tactic

461
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:33,408
I think if you're if you're sitting there and you know I think I think that every lawyer kind of

462
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,688
Has different

463
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:41,088
Things sure have I said something and Maddie responded with well I'd be f*****

464
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:47,488
Alright alright but the handcuffs off

465
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:53,888
You like the explanation of their business. It's exactly like Banks you know you know how when you fire a bank teller they have to run

466
00:28:54,144 --> 00:29:00,288
The bank for a day before they can leave

467
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:06,688
Later year later they just show back up

468
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:10,784
Before you do it by that's what they do.

469
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:15,648
So we get to talk in a little bit about Alex's payment and how much money he made

470
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:22,048
In certain years until the year 2015 comes up and here's Alex's monetary situation

471
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:27,168
Fell in 2015 you yourself had a another Goodyear you drew

472
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,240
8.3 million in compensation from

473
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,264
Your company right

474
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:35,616
To see the document exhibit 25

475
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:40,992
20

476
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,296
15U see your draw

477
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,624
In 2015 with 8.3 million dollars

478
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,392
Yes Bank

479
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,184
And you took a salary

480
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,232
On top of that of 97

481
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,792
Thousand dollars right

482
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,584
Yes all right

483
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,168
And then in addition to that you received a distribution

484
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:03,264
As a result of your interest in tlj are correct

485
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,544
I don't know

486
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,848
We talked a little bit about PLJ are you

487
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,152
And I think

488
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:13,504
Your testimony yesterday was you weren't quite sure what it was

489
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,832
But let me ask you a few more questions

490
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,368
About that

491
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:22,208
So there'll be some questions about this but you're sort of the brief version of it is

492
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:29,120
Free Speech systems is a company that Infowars is actually the name of the actual come

493
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:31,680
Company presumably

494
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:35,008
And so they sell supplements that are so old

495
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:41,152
From pqp are which is owned by like Alex and his parents

496
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:48,064
Then plgr is another company on top of that vittone's pqp are right

497
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:54,464
Alex and his mom okay and then there's a EJ trust which has like a large interest

498
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,512
Holding 8dl Jr

499
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:02,912
It sure basically all of it is just this nesting doll thing

500
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:05,984
Alex and his family

501
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:09,568
Sort of the brief version of it is it is like

502
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:14,432
The dumbest way of doing a Cayman Islands tax.

503
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:18,784
It cuz it feels like you're doing this to hide who owns it

504
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:25,440
But it took like five minutes to be like what will you own this send you on this and the owners of this

505
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:28,512
Yeah it's your initials

506
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:35,424
You might as well have called it picnic texting LLC

507
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,240
Oh you know we we found at that

508
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:44,640
We we got all chests use money because it was his initials on the goddamn account

509
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:51,296
I just imagine him going till the kids account no being like mesar

510
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,576
That's not how this works

511
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,952
Put my money where the Nazi gold is

512
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:01,024
Alex has an accountant

513
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,888
Name Lydia Hernandez and she is somebody who is kind of an all-purpose player

514
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:09,984
Infowars

515
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,336
Quite a stretch of their business time

516
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,712
An email from her comes up as it relates to plgr

517
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,784
It's so weird how Alex

518
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,600
Seems very reluctant to praise her

519
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,624
You see

520
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,160
This email

521
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,440
From

522
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,256
Lydia Hernandez to your father

523
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,280
Dr. Jones

524
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,304
Yeah yes

525
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,608
She says dr. Jones I printed out some of the

526
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,376
Reports

527
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:41,216
And place them on your desk in an envelope marked personal and confidential

528
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,288
And you see that attached to this email

529
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,080
Isn't it spreadsheet

530
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:49,152
That'll 2015-2 current distribution work

531
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,688
Yes

532
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,224
The Lydia

533
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,528
Hernandez is your former

534
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,320
Repeat systems account

535
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,344
Correct

536
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,904
Shell said a number of other job she did

537
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,440
Some HR work rate

538
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,768
She was kind of an all-round troubleshooter correct

539
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,560
Yes for the best you ever had

540
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:09,120
Amazing

541
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,168
Right remember that okay

542
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,192
What you degree

543
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:13,984
Should I play

544
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,008
What

545
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,056
Is there some reason you don't want it

546
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,336
Acknowledge that

547
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,896
At some point at least you thought that you was amazing employee

548
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,624
Genuinely don't know why I don't know I don't like really,

549
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:37,024
Potato good as an account in case I need to throw under a bus later yeah I don't know exactly where the

550
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:43,424
These questions are going and I might have tried think about it if you're asking me to confirm that I

551
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:49,824
I think she's amazing that suggests to me that there's some sort of crime that I need to blame on her

552
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,872
Seems like since she's come up

553
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:58,272
This is an this is going to be a great opportunity to buspirone

554
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:04,672
The day is long

555
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,464
Play nice lady criminals can be nice

556
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,536
Everybody knows that.

557
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:15,936
So Alex doesn't know anything about any of these numbers and

558
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,704
He does

559
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,752
And we're going to go to the tab of this

560
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,032
Spreadsheet that says

561
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,312
Distribution

562
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,128
And

563
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,944
You see here

564
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,968
Mr. Jones

565
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,576
On the column A it was two thousand and

566
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:35,136
15 and then column see it shows

567
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,696
Dates of distributions

568
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,744
8 out of p q p r

569
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,560
And

570
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,352
Those distributions

571
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,632
Went to

572
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,912
2

573
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,496
Other entities jlj rapelje are correct

574
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,568
I think so

575
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,616
Are you familiar with

576
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,408
This

577
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,968
Distribution scheme you have here where

578
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,248
Pqp are

579
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,784
Is making distributions of it

580
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,552
Proceeds

581
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:04,576
2

582
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,856
Do corporate entities

583
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,648
One of which you control

584
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,560
CPA David so

585
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,096
Okay

586
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,656
That seems just impossible to believe

587
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,448
You do like most

588
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:26,848
Business owners he's not really interested in whether or not there's money here

589
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:33,248
Are there somebody else's problem text me everyday asking for sales.

590
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:39,648
Flower really all that impossible

591
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:45,536
Has no idea what these companies even are better like if he god-like

592
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:50,912
If that were true which it's not if it were true he would be the perfect mark

593
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:53,472
Just take him for everything

594
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:57,824
It would be so easy if you had no idea what all of this structure

595
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:02,176
Existed for holyshit frankly if this were true

596
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:04,992
Then Lydia Hernandez should have

597
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,552
Taken several hundred million dollars

598
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:14,720
Would not have been difficult in La Trust

599
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:17,792
Yeah I think that if

600
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:22,912
Alex didn't actually understand any of this or didn't know any of this

601
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:27,520
This lawsuit was going on and his lawyers we're meeting with him

602
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,056
It would be an emergency

603
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:33,408
Total it would be like a understand

604
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,200
That's it this is setup

605
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:40,576
And it wouldn't all be set up entirely to that big Zacks perfect

606
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,880
Structure for him

607
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:48,768
Try to be sneaky

608
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,560
But if you look at this spreadsheet

609
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,608
You'll see that

610
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,144
According to this

611
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,192
The distributions from

612
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,984
Pqp RNs

613
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,776
The company that

614
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,568
You claim

615
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,336
So

616
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,616
The supplements on your website

617
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,664
Bad

618
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:09,248
Dale Jr

619
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,528
Is

620
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:14,624
Has two members David and Carol Wright those your parents

621
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:18,208
Npl Jr has two members

622
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,768
Alex and Carol that you and your mom

623
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,536
Right

624
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,328
And you have a 90%

625
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:28,192
The timing matters

626
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,520
In 2016 because that's

627
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,288
Reflected on this

628
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,080
2015 20

629
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,384
And

630
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,432
According to this

631
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,456
Spreadsheet

632
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:41,248
As a result of your

633
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,320
90

634
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:46,880
Percent interest in plgr

635
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,160
You received

636
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,952
In 2015

637
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,000
80% of the total

638
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:54,560
Apqp are distributions of 3

639
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,840
24 million right

640
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:56,864
Jackson

641
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:57,888
Alright

642
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,960
And so that's 3.4 million

643
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:04,800
Distribution on top of the 8.3 million that you drew down

644
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:06,336
Right

645
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,640
The accountant

646
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,944
Some of it pays the other thing in backing

647
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,784
Advertising

648
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,624
This has nothing to do this spreadsheet you don't see anything on here about advertise

649
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,392
Right

650
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,744
I don't understand all these numbers

651
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,512
Okay

652
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,304
I don't know numbers

653
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:32,704
Baffled I made like 12 million dollars but I don't know anything about anyting it was an accident honestly I just

654
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:39,104
Around and accidentally over $10

655
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,664
Falling into several hundred pounds of money

656
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,688
I mean it's silly

657
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,712
It's silly

658
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:50,112
We've all been there trip there's a bag filled with money

659
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,416
2

660
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,696
When your mind

661
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,256
When you think of the Common Man

662
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,536
Do you think of

663
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,328
What comes to mind for you

664
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:07,008
Hey tomorrow I just think it's on average everybody makes about 10 million a year I think that's I think Alex

665
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:13,408
Common man I do represent the Everyman

666
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,944
Stinger video yesterday

667
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,224
If he post about this

668
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,760
Position that you told

669
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,576
And in which you later published on your website that you

670
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,880
Told your audience that your Common Man

671
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:23,648
Right

672
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,672
Yep

673
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,208
You said that

674
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:30,560
Connecticut is really a bedroom community for all the riches

675
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,840
Is people in New York right

676
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:34,912
No billionaires

677
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:37,472
The country for trillions yeah

678
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,008
But you're the kind of man

679
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:39,776
Right

680
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:43,104
Damn, where did you fly into

681
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,408
Exactly

682
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,688
It wasn't

683
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,248
Kennedy year LaGuardia or Bradley

684
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,040
Commercial

685
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,832
North Little Rock blank privately

686
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,392
Because I also saw in your

687
00:39:55,648 --> 00:40:01,280
Video that you put out yesterday that you were kind of saying you never seen so many private planes in your life when you landed right

688
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:06,912
And

689
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,704
Recent rainbow flying

690
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,984
Small private planes

691
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:10,752
Because

692
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:14,336
You earned over 11 million dollars in 2015 right

693
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:21,760
We had to do that that was for that

694
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,552
Call Michelle Jones

695
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:29,952
You just finished testifying that you have no idea what these numbers mean

696
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:35,584
Go to do with a wife of Jackson

697
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:41,984
Oh that's rough every time he's like

698
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,056
Know if I offer up this information

699
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:51,456
It will make more sense yeah this is exculpatory I figured out

700
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:53,760
That is kind of

701
00:40:54,016 --> 00:41:00,160
One of the things that's really interesting if you watch these deposition that really do get a sense that one of Alex

702
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,696
Innate traits

703
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:04,256
The he cannot stop himself from

704
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:10,656
He's trying to make explanations to wiggle around and find the

705
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:13,216
The way that this works out in his best interest

706
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:19,616
So a previously that money was I don't know anything about this right then he comes up with like

707
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:26,016
Had to buy my wife out of the business that's why there's so much money totally hit so he offers that up not realizing this country

708
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:29,856
Predicts the idiots I previously and it doesn't really help

709
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:36,256
It raises more questions than it answers like a grotesque

710
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:39,840
Example of that towards the end of this episode put like

711
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,608
It's just

712
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,144
It's just his psychology

713
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:48,544
It is it is like those those shows are or you know like the cop shows

714
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,384
Where there's the criminal mastermind who's also a psychopath who can

715
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,015
Just getting on the witness stand and I'll just charm and be so you know those things

716
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:58,783
Like

717
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:05,439
It is kind of funny because they never choose a really incompetent psychopath who lost a billion dollars

718
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:11,839
Who knows I like just saw Alex like in the Connecticut

719
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:18,239
He probably thought that's who he was like I can get my way out of it hahaha

720
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:24,639
Can call this a struggle session and then everything will be fine it's amazing it is amazing

721
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:27,199
Insanity required

722
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:33,599
Soyumi course of the trial itself we learned that the Bitcoin donations that

723
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:39,999
Alex got the millions you know it wasn't

724
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:46,399
Play save Infowars type of advertising and of course Alex says that

725
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:51,519
All that money went to the legal defense for Uno's

726
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:57,919
I'm but asking some of these questions about other donations and such that go to be legal

727
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:01,503
Wishy-washy

728
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,551
You separately raise money

729
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,343
From your audience

730
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,623
For your own

731
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,647
Would you play me

732
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:08,927
Defensive

733
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:10,719
Infowars right okay

734
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:11,743
And

735
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,023
People can

736
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,047
Give to that

737
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:14,815
Users

738
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:17,119
Pacific ring for that the Infowars legal defense

739
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,655
Doctors website

740
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:20,447
There's a specific website

741
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:22,751
And when people give to that website

742
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,031
Where does it go

743
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:27,871
It is a cute aesthetic put in account and accounted for in

744
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,431
It's a free speech systems

745
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:33,247
It's accounted for adding account

746
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,111
Play Lydia

747
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:43,487
Thriller I just bought

748
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:46,047
When tonight's that's putting The Ledger is that then

749
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,095
Last time I checked I think it's been spent

750
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,399
When was last time check

751
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,447
I checked it to the last week

752
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:55,007
Okay and your sworn testimony here is that

753
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,543
Every penny

754
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,591
That was deposited into

755
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,895
The account you just described for me

756
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,175
Went to

757
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:02,943
Your lawyers

758
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:12,159
I would definitely counting myself but that's that that's my general but believe that's what the moneys for and there's also a

759
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,951

760
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,743
Donate right

761
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:18,303
And that money just goes right into the 33 system Channel

762
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:24,447
The war fun are you at war with somebody

763
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:27,007
What their crime crime syndicate

764
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,639
It's

765
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:38,527
It sounds better on his show it really does he really does there aren't there are too many sarcastic

766
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:52,095
Fun is silly outside of the context of his performances

767
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,655
Do you understand that we're human beings in the world

768
00:44:54,911 --> 00:45:01,055
And not fictional we're fighting a war situation

769
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:07,455
You and me real people just trying to get answers yet girl reactions

770
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:11,551
Question comes up Alex's at war with his global

771
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:12,575
Who are the

772
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:18,975
Well are the parents of these children

773
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:19,743
What's nasty

774
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,767
Or my clients

775
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,047
Globalist

776
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:26,143
Sandy Hook parents

777
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:28,959
The ones you have are your using them

778
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:33,567
Nhb earlier times as well Global's conglomerate to try to silence

779
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,591
Populist voices

780
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:35,615
Anderson

781
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,919
They're just being used as pawns by you

782
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:38,943
So

783
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:40,735
Did the Sandy Hook families

784
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:42,527
That

785
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,831
Have decided to sue you are just Pawns

786
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,367
In a much larger

787
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:51,487
Battle that were saying about I'm not going to speak for them in my view they're being used by you

788
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,535
Senator Blumenthal and others

789
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,303
Response

790
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,095
Okay by me there lawyer

791
00:45:56,863 --> 00:46:01,983
Ambulance Chaser Democrat anti-free speech anti-gun Tyron

792
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,799
So I need to be

793
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:07,359
ShopRite people understand

794
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:08,639
Dad

795
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:12,735
That that that that America is going to stand firm Against The Bullying the censorship

796
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:16,063
Do you want somebody biting in all of it and we're never going to stop resisting

797
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:16,831
So I

798
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,879
But I'm I'm you just refer to me

799
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,927
The family's lawyer as a toy

800
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:22,975
Preferred to me yesterday

801
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:29,119
As if it's filing fraudulent documents on purpose about financial

802
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:32,959
Ridiculous

803
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:40,127
A couple times

804
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:44,479
Shut the fuk up no reason to be talking right now

805
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:47,039
I swear like listening to some of this

806
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:50,367
Like if it's available to the jury

807
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,135
Yeah

808
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:57,535
I don't think there's a billion he's lucky I know it is kind of like

809
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:03,679
It's kind of like I understand why we had to have a trial with a jury there and we did the whole thing it was very satisfying

810
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:10,079
But there is a part of me that's like you could have just played the deposition for the jurors and they've been like 1 billion let's get Avenue

811
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:14,431
May have had access to it in the chambers a room but it's

812
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:20,831
4 days of depositions you know they're not good weed they didn't watch obviously they didn't watch for days of deposition

813
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:26,207
Play the transcript true true I don't know

814
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:28,511
Really it it's bad

815
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:31,839
They're pawns your Tyrone

816
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,863
Justin

817
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,703
Yeah I will say if they skimmed it they would have gotten more than enough

818
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:43,359
Yeah yeah for sure I don't think anybody needs to 12% masochist in our audience who have now

819
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:45,151
I'll decide if they want to watch

820
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:50,527
Depositions but other than me I don't I don't know if anybody needs to subject themselves to play a game

821
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:56,159
With these depositions where we just fast-forward and then click play on a certain

822
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,463
Spa and just see what the next 10 seconds are

823
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:05,119
Some of it some of it might that might be fruitful there I mean look there long stretches where

824
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:10,495
A lot of the same stuff that we've we've heard and talk about a bunch of times before

825
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:14,847
There's a long stretch in this episode or is that deposition about

826
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,895
Are all the various

827
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:23,295
Anomalies in quotes and we've talked about that a hundred times it's just basically him Maddie pointing out to Alex

828
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:25,599
MaxPreps was wrong wrong

829
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:30,207
It is you could if you just randomly dropped in it could be that

830
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:33,023
Could be gold could never know

831
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,327
It is it is him

832
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:40,191
You know I do think that hitting his mind calling them ambulance Chasers

833
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:42,495
Is a good is a good thing because it

834
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:48,895
It draws the image of a about the lawyer who's got somebody

835
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:51,199
Engage in the arm in a sling that's actually fine

836
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,223
And I get that

837
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,783
But that's kind of the problem

838
00:48:55,551 --> 00:49:01,695
A lot of the times that ambulance Chaser does have to be using somebody who doesn't really have

839
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:05,023
Have that much of a problem we've never been like

840
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:07,839
That ambulance Chaser representing

841
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:14,239
The families of victims of the children of one of the worst massacres in the history of the United States price

842
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:19,359
Yeah that's a little bit different if you truly ambulance Chaser there it makes you look like a

843
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:25,759
It's embedded in there anyway that Alex I don't take recognizes it's just

844
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:32,415
Like Shifting the accusation onto the lawyer is really just the way that Alex is trying to take

845
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:39,071
He's trying to deny it without denying to take agency away from the parents while attack

846
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:46,239
Like all of this sucks all this is fake retro the poor parents they weren't being busy

847
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,519
These lawyers

848
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,799
Which makes no sense

849
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,335
No yeah no

850
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:52,127
And it's a shity

851
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,407
Yep

852
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,687
So

853
00:49:54,943 --> 00:50:01,087
The discussion of the child exploitation material that was in the email I sent

854
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:05,183
To the plaintiffs attorneys by Alex's lawyers comes up

855
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:08,511
And here's a little conversation about it that ends with

856
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:11,071
Probably unfortunate

857
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,607
Moment for Alex

858
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,399
I'm a timer

859
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:15,935
I'm

860
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,751
Because I represent

861
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,055
Senior families in this plot against

862
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:21,823
Right

863
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:25,151
Can your overall Democrat Party plot against America

864
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:29,759
Right well where you are

865
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:30,783
Why do you

866
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:31,551
You talked about me and

867
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,575
Pastime show

868
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:35,647
You put a a million-dollar

869
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,695
Bounty on

870
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:41,535
Me for having my head on a pike right now

871
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:46,143
Shut the Charlotte Hornets very clear photo did you pound

873
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:51,007
Your photos are like a cut to Hawaii shot of that

874
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,615
The camera got on

875
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:57,663
My photo and then pounded my picture

876
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,431
Right

877
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:04,063
You know you do we need to show the video

878
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,999
Talk about the fact that I was suspicious

879
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:13,791
Anti Alex Jones

880
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,631

And them headlines the news are Alex Jones child horns

882

883

00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,599
Who is the first person

900
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:10,879
To ever

901
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,927
Publicizing anyway

902
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,207
That

903
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,999
Your lawyers

904
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:16,767
Headset

905
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:17,791
Material

906
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:18,559
Continue trial

907
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,327
Pornography

908
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,119
Who is the first person

909
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:24,703
And everything

910
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:25,983
Mr. Jones

911
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:29,311
You don't remember who the first person was

912
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,103
To State publicly

913
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,127
That

914
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:37,503
This whole issue with child pronography and your company providing it to your lawyers and then sending it to us

915
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:38,527
With you

916
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,295
Objection

917
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:45,695
Company-provided unopened email it wasn't opening

918
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:46,463
Cowboy

919
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:52,863
Poor Alex boy doesn't realize that he did this to himself by trying to get out ahead of a stripper

920
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:58,495
Alex drunk hanging out with Norm this happened cuz I got to get out of this

921
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:01,055
Boy got on air started screaming about it

922
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:08,223
There's no during headlines that we're being put out by nefarious globalist

923
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:14,623
Self know which was what college was saying the headlines of you put out

924
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:19,743
Did this man that's one of those things that I really I really just hate

925
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:23,583
Number of billion reasons

926
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,119
I hate that happened

927
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:29,727
Not least of which just because it muddied so much it's just like

928
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:30,751
It doesn't

929
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:33,311
Do anyone any good

930
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:39,711
You know it's just awful all doll around anytime you know

931
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:44,319
It's bad yeah it in terms of this

932
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:45,599
Are you dude

933
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:49,439
Think that is Alex hadn't done what he did

934
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:53,791
Then this would have been handled quite differently

935
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:58,911
Like no one would have gotten sanctioned over this either wouldn't have been any kind of

936
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:04,031
Like charges brought against the lawyers or Alex it would be very easily understood

937
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:07,103
This was something that was sent to them it wasn't opened

938
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:13,503
Alex made a much bigger deal out of this by trying to make a narrative out of that everything something

939
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:19,903
To accuse these lawyers of setting him up right every every article every headline that he had

940
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:21,439
Embedded his

941
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:26,559
I'm saying these things true it's not like they

942
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:27,327
It's crazy

943
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:30,399
So Alex Rambles quite a bit

944
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:35,263
Finally gets to just stating directly that

945
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:37,567
He believes that the families are Pawns

946
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:39,103
In a plot against a smart

947
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,407
Getting back to my point Bell

948
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:43,199
My questions

949
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:46,783
What you see

950
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:47,551
He has

951
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:50,111
A really kind of life-and-death struggle

952
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:51,391
Between

953
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,159
You

954
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:54,975
Your audience

955
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:56,511
That supports you

956
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:57,279
And

957
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,047
This

958
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:59,327
Movement 2

959
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:00,863
School Bus movement

960
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,143
Right

961
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:04,191
You consider

962
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,215
The plaintiff

963
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:08,543
The unwitting Pawns in that attack against you

964
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:15,199
There's no doubt the corporate media the system is using the lawsuit to try to get rid of the First Amendment for the general public they admit that

965
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,391
I think what you're testifying

966
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,415
That you consider Mike

967
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:25,183
Alliance

968
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:27,231
The unwitting Pawns

969
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:28,511
In

970
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,047
The plot against

971
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,375
What I see it is

972
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:34,911
Is that

973
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:37,471
Misrepresentation when I've apologized

974
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:40,799
Claims that I'm going after people when I wasn't

975
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:42,335
I just seen

976
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:44,127
Really a lot of

977
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:46,687
Sad people that watch for children

978
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:47,967
Using

979
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:53,087
Me to keep story of her children in the news and gun-control Munoz

980
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,927
Accusations by you guys

981
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:59,487
MLS Playoffs Antioch when I know I did

982
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:03,071
Social media was exploding then

983
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:03,839
Began

984
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:07,679
Was around 2012 or three getting any everybody grew with it

985
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:11,007
And Barack Obama grew all the conservative media just fine

986
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:15,359
Liberal media I know that it's well-known

987
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:19,967
You're staying here and there Sandy Hook

988
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,159
Do you consider

989
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,463
Mike line

990
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:31,743
Now

991
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:33,791
Unwitting

992
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:37,375
Overarching

993
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:38,655
Accuracy

994
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,007
You and the freeway

995
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,591
Absolutely okay thank you

996
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:52,991
Tracy thousands of articles I mean I mean thank you for your wow wow

997
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,831
Wrong answer

998
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:58,111
Boy

999
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:01,695
Ono if you just couldn't couldn't not

1000
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,487
Notes could not know

1001
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:06,303
But like the well

1002
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:11,423
In a in a situation like this if you give an answer and then the lawyer says thank you for your answer

1003
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,191
You just

1004
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:16,543
Really screwed yourself you're f*****

1005
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:19,359
If you should be really worried

1006
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:24,991
So the question comes up about whether or not Alex contacted any of the

1007
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:28,831
And whether he ever was in touch with anybody

1008
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:35,231
Either you ever had some sort of background report on anybody that nobody seems to know

1009
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:39,327
But this is this is just a nice set-up

1010
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,351
And Spike

1011
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,143

Not that I remember

1014
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:52,639
Have you ever spoken

1015
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:53,407

00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:54,943
Any

1017
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:56,223

00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:02,111
No we've invited them on the show

1019
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:03,391
You've never personally

1020
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:05,183
I know

1021
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:06,719
Nobody on your behalf

1022
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:07,487
As far as you know

1023
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,911
Have you ever sent letters to

1024
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:15,679
To any

1025
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:16,959

Boston

1055
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:01,407
Or your audience that you have been

1056
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:03,199
Seven letters and getting on the phone with

1057
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:08,063
No I don't know the context of this

1058
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:10,111
What

1059
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:11,647
Talking Dead

1060
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:14,719
But I can't remember the times but I told myself that it wasn't true

1061
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:18,303
Well you just testified completely off

1062
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:22,911
So which is true I barely remember deposit

1063
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:23,679
I don't know

1064
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:30,591
I don't remember this man that is maybe the best example of how

1065
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:36,991
Holding two contradictory ideas inside your head at the same time and Alex is a master of doing that

1066
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:37,759
I will give him that

1067
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:39,039
I will give him that

1068
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:44,415
It's when nothing is real it is quite then you know

1069
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:47,743
Certain there's a certain place that I get I guess

1070
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:51,071
I mean look

1071
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:57,471
It's fun to talk s*** on your show and being like we've talked to these people and they're all dropping

1072
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:00,543
The suit it's great it just

1073
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,567
You shouldn't

1074
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,847
Things are recorded

1075
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:08,223
F****** them running not be there later

1076
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,527
Man

1077
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:18,207
We should really destroy every episode of something immediately after do I get no evidence of anything ever

1078
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:22,047
So embarrassing

1079
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:23,583
The discussion

1080
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:29,983
Pretty long discussion about Alex's video of his final statement on Sandy Hook

1081
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,263
Conversations around

1082
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:33,311
The various anomalies

1083
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:35,103
That are incorrect

1084
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:41,503
So I'm going to play a ton of that here is one click of the discussion about the Bloomberg email

1085
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:43,807
And the reason I kept this in his just because

1086
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:47,647
It's so funny to hear Alex talk about his own ideas this way

1087
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:49,439
And I'll ask you to pause it

1088
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,207
Intermittently

1089
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,711
You're just us a number one

1090
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:16,319
On the day before the shooting an email sent out by Bloomberg's anti-gun group

1091
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:21,183
You pull up on the screen as you're staying that and Infowars article

1092
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:21,951
Correct

1093
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:24,255
Yes okay

1094
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:29,119
And that enforced headlines exposed how Bloomberg

1095
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:33,215
And it's dated March 13th 2013

1096
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:34,239
Correct

1097
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:36,031
Yes my are dykes right

1098
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,079
Yes he was a writer of yours

1099
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,871
Okay

1100
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:42,175
Can you pull up this article

1101
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:47,039
As evidence of the fact that mr. Bloomberg's organization had in fact send out an email

1102
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:52,671
The day before the shooting as you just said correct but that's why you put it there

1103
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:58,047
I guess I mean nobody spontaneously decided to do that

1104
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:02,655
Know a lot of times they just put stuff up on the show but I don't know

1105
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,935
Are you claiming that

1106
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,751
Are you claiming that

1107
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:12,639
This was not published in the middle of your statement as evidence

1108
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:16,479
For your claim

1109
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:25,695
But the biggest

1110
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,231
So

1111
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:28,511
You said that

1112
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:32,607
America Center email the day before the shooting saying prepare for a big of a

1113
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:33,375
Right

1114
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:36,703
Right and we talked about that yesterday is being evidence.

1115
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:39,519
For your claim at Sandy Hook was a hoax because Mr Bloomberg

1116
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:42,079
Would have foreknowledge of the event,

1117
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:42,847
Right

1118
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:45,663
The used

1119
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:46,431
But

1120
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,967
You said he jumped the gun

1121
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:48,991
Meaning that

1122
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:51,039
You release that email early

1123
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:53,599
Intending to send it after the fact

1124
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:54,623
Knowing it

1125
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:55,903
If there was going to be home

1126
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:56,671
Looks correct

1127
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:59,743
That's what I people Earth

1128
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:06,655
You can imply that you'd agree with me that

1129
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,679
That's what you meant

1130
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:08,959
And you said blue me

1131
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:10,239
You jumped the gun

1132
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:13,311
You sent this email out early knowing that

1133
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:15,615
There was going to be a hoax right

1134
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,431
The yes mr. Jones

1135
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:20,223
I'm yes thank you

1136
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:26,623
A possible interpretation of my thoughts at was a rollercoaster ride of one clip

1137
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:33,023
That was insane likes to scribble

1138
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:38,911
My mind went from being a desk situation very much like you and I right now to being Alex

1139
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:45,311
As one of those children who just had a traumatic event sitting there with the cops with a crayon scribbling down as the

1140
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:46,335
Cops ask question

1141
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,639
About what happened that's what's going on here

1142
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:53,503
Yeah my mind even goes to like a kid at a desk

1143
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:59,647
Like one of those desks that has like the pocket under that put all your supplies

1144
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:06,047
Is a little bit too small for Alex but he's sitting there not paying attention in class drawings @s

1145
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:07,839
I could do that

1146
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:17,567
This is another thing that comes up pretty repeatedly in terms of Alex's of Asians and that is

1147
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:23,455
Someone put that email or that story up on like an editing or something most

1148
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:29,855
Yeah and no that's not the right thing supposed to be there is evidence of the claims that I'm making but something

1149
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:34,463
Buddy else put this together and it's not the right thing you know what I'm not mad at

1150
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:40,863
Write the story of this deficit that ends up being an excuse for at least a couple things

1151
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:42,655
Could imply that is

1152
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:43,935
Add amazing

1153
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:47,263
Misdirect from a thing you were imply

1154
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:53,663
I was applying it but you could imply that I was implying you couldn't play with this is a claim that I made you could

1155
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:04,415
What a dork anyway Alex just like he's he's in deflection mode he's just

1156
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:06,975
Hey what about the behavior they make mistakes buddy

1157
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:07,999
Fine

1158
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:10,047
You don't

1159
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:12,095
I've heard you say several times

1160
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:13,119
This morning

1161
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:16,959
And yesterday that he got things wrong made mistakes

1162
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:18,239
Right

1163
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:26,175
And I appreciate you saying that like the New York Times

1164
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:32,831
I'm sure they're liberal they're good

1165
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:40,255
Give you an opportunity here

1166
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:41,279
And

1167
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:43,839
You're not going to get any debate for me that

1168
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:46,399
Media makes mistakes all the time

1169
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,423
Lassonde have

1170
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:48,191
Grievous cough

1171
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:54,847
But

1172
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:55,871
Acknowledge

1173
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:56,895
That

1174
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:58,943
What you claim Army

1175
01:06:59,199 --> 01:06:59,967
Mistakes that you made

1176
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:01,503
Regarding

1177
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:04,319
The worst school shooting

1178
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,647
Where you claimed

1179
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,415
That it was a

1180
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:09,695
Oaks

1181
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:11,231
In order to

1182
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:13,023
As part of a

1183
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:13,791
What

1184
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:15,071
To disarm the public

1185
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:17,631
Real concert

1186
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:19,423
4

1187
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:21,471
The people who you claimed were part of the

1188
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:26,335
Adam Lanza killer children

1189
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,615
No you didn't

1190
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:33,503
That's a shitt response yeah

1191
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:40,159
You recognize that the mistakes and things that you were engaged in surrounding this have

1192
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:40,927
People

1193
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,975
Tell the guy to kill anybody

1194
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:44,255
He's dad

1195
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:46,559
Yeah it is it is very much

1196
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:48,863
It is very much you can you can just

1197
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:49,631
Like

1198
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:54,239
Something something I read Trump said the other day was

1199
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:55,263
If

1200
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:58,335
The candidates that I support win

1201
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:00,383
That all of the

1202
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,663
Glory should go to me

1203
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,943
They lose

1204
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:09,343
No one should blame me for anything and it is so like that's just encapsulated in what Alex does

1205
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:13,695
No it does make sense

1206
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:18,815
What is responsibility if it's not just claiming credit for things as credit

1207
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:21,887
Alex

1208
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:26,495
Ask about this idea that the audience comes to him for truth

1209
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:29,823
This is weird

1210
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:33,151
He is a weird response there's a little bit of grandstanding okay

1211
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:34,687
I just want to see

1212
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:36,223
If you understand

1213
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,039
When you tell

1214
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:40,063
Your audience

1215
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,087
Comes to you

1216
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:42,367
Or the truth

1217
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:44,415
Because that's what you tell them you're giving up

1218
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:49,023
Run like the Supreme Court nominee I can stay with a woman as yes

1219
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:53,631
You're Expecting

1220
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:55,423
Oh my God

1221
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:57,471
I don't want to play games with you

1222
01:08:57,727 --> 01:09:01,311
I'm talking about my client I don't give a

1223
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:04,895
Relax people you guys

1224
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:06,687
You trying to do right now

1225
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:08,223
Distracting the question mask

1226
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,271
So I just want you to answer my

1227
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:11,807
Okay

1228
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:13,855
I didn't think it was going to be hard for you acknowledge

1229
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:15,903
That you your audience comes through for the

1230
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:19,487
Would you just agree with me on that

1231
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:21,279
Can you make mistakes

1232
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:23,583
Are you and I can disagree all day long about whether you make me

1233
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:24,863
You lied on her

1234
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:25,631
Alright

1235
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:30,239
What the

1236
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:33,823
You agree with me that a minimum

1237
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:34,591
You were right

1238
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:35,871
Industv

1239
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:36,639
Since you made it outside

1240
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:44,319
No I believe I believe they were real anomalies and I was and I was wrong I said that years ago

1241
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,159
Injection

1242
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:51,231
A video yet

1243
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:53,535
Yesterday you said you were Reckless

1244
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:57,375
Do we have to clip

1245
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:06,079
You responded to exactly what I think is like the most important under like it just ate today

1246
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:09,151
There is

1247
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:11,455
I wasn't paying attention amazing

1248
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:12,991
Is

1249
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:17,087
Dark astonishing it's it's such a blip

1250
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:20,415
11 terms of buildings that are said in this deposition

1251
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:24,511
But to me it's so important because it is just like Alex thinks he can

1252
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:30,143
Absolve himself of this wrongdoing and the pain that he causes people because they

1253
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,935
I was even paying attention

1254
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:38,335
Like no dude that stopped betters Greenwald interview and he said like he was drunk

1255
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:44,735
I was just drunk when I was this better when I hit your son with the car I was

1256
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:48,831
Drunk and I wasn't paying attention so leave me alone

1257
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:51,647
Well that's actually a really good sort of

1258
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:53,439
I wait to look at it it's like

1259
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:55,487
I ran over your kid

1260
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:57,279
But I was drunk when I did it

1261
01:10:57,535 --> 01:11:00,607
So I'm not a bad person I didn't mean to hit your kids

1262
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:07,007
You did decide to drink and drive which is something that maybe make

1263
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,543
Makes you less of a good person

1264
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:14,943
The decision point was earlier I wasn't paying attention when I made all this b******* up

1265
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:17,759
Threw it around about these grieving parents

1266
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:19,295
No no no

1267
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:25,695
The act of saying the thing you're trying to absolve yourself is irrelevant the decision to behave in

1268
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:32,095
That way and operate your news Outlet writing like you're a drunk driver either the problem and that does make you a bad person

1269
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:33,119
When you

1270
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:35,167
Made the decision to drive drunk

1271
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:41,567
You said something and that was I don't particularly know that this is a possibility maybe

1272
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:45,407
Maybe even a high possibility and I don't

1273
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:47,967
Care and if your kid dies

1274
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:54,367
I know that could happen but it's less valuable to me it said just getting home without taking a tour Expedia

1275
01:11:54,623 --> 01:12:00,767
Weird for me to drive drunk and for Alex it's more expedient to make sure it up because it's

1276
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:01,535
Sensational

1277
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:07,935
And his audience enjoys it did you not hear that I made 11 million dollars of course I wasn't paying attention when I was

1278
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:13,823
Lying about that lot of money

1279
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:14,591
So

1280
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:17,151
This makes it really got me

1281
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:18,175
Thinking

1282
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:20,479
I don't believe a good bit of this

1283
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:25,343
But there's a interesting level of false introspection that's going on

1284
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:30,207
So how old were you in Sandy Hook

1285
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:32,511
P38

1286
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:33,535
Broadcast

1287
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:35,583
Screenshot the number

1288
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:36,863
Jackson

1289
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:40,703
She'll eventually if I don't want to believe

1290
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:45,055
I have free speech.

1291
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:48,127
What what is a gun owner I'm being blamed for something people then

1292
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:55,039
Basically have a baby form of resistance to that just didn't believe no it didn't happen because it's a terrible thing

1293
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:00,159
People then start

1294
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:03,487
I'm so the mind then

1295
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:05,535
Start finding ways to

1296
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:09,375
Absolutely then vilify the media on the group's they're saying and doing that

1297
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,167
Well

1298
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:15,775
Myself and I

1299
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:18,335
Therapy of Earth actually end

1300
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:21,919
Call therapist.

1301
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:23,711
I think

1302
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:24,991
Be commended for that

1303
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:26,271
But I also want to say

1304
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:31,647
I also want to ask you whether in that

1305
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:32,415
Reflection

1306
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:34,207
You come to realize

1307
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:37,023
That the statement you made

1308
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:38,047
Wrong

1309
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:39,327
You play more mistakes

1310
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:42,399
Jackson

1311
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:47,775
Just like the judge lying and saying we get any false documents and you lie in court is hurting

1312
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:50,335
Liberal in Lubbock

1313
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:00,319
Dr.

1314
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:03,903
And what you say

1315
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,279
You don't speak

1316
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:10,303
That

1317
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:12,607
The family

1318
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:15,679
Quaver actor

1319
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:17,471
Suffered

1320
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:18,495
As a result

1321
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:26,687
I don't think

1322
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:30,783
Do you level a pain I went through losing their children being a father myself for children

1323
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:35,903
Having four natural daughter I don't think going to that level of pain are the worst thing happen

1324
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:38,719
Even comes in any

1325
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:39,743
Harrison

1326
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:41,023
Things I did

1327
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:42,559
In my

1328
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:45,375
Mistakes in my own delusion

1329
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:49,983
I think it's really admirable of Maddie to not take the bait

1330
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:56,383
That Alex was throwing out there with all the liberal and loving both much you know because what he's doing is trying to do

1331
01:14:56,639 --> 01:15:01,247
Derail the the point of attention which is threatening to him which is you did

1332
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:07,647
Cause this pain and hurt to these people and he says like oh yeah

1333
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:08,927
Just like this

1334
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:11,743
And if you just ignore that you like yeah fine

1335
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:14,047
But you dare just like that then

1336
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:18,911
You're agreeing with

1337
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:24,543
Like muddy The Waters by bringing in outside grievances that you have

1338
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:30,175
But focusing it it just straight on what we're talking about your answer is yes absolutely

1339
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:36,575
Jerk know what you tried to do was agree with me and then throw keys off into the corn

1340
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:37,343
Springfield to be like

1341
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:43,743
Don't you want to know obviously some of the keys that he throws are repulsive

1342
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:45,791
I know they they are things that

1343
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:47,071
You know you'd walked

1344
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:49,119
The corrector be like hey hold on now

1345
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:55,519
I'll bet in a setting like this it's ghetto key just to stay on point and that that'll be difficult to do with it distraction

1346
01:15:55,775 --> 01:16:01,919
An artist like Alex absolutely end it is such an endurance test you know like

1347
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:06,271
Only as as I'm listening to this you know this one in the last one it's like

1348
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:08,575
I could not do this

1349
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:10,623
If the Judgment was in doubt

1350
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:17,023
You know what I'm saying like now that it's over and I know that he loses and all the stuff then I could listen to

1351
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:21,887
Him in this deposition tell me these things cuz I've got a big smile in the back of my mind

1352
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:23,935
But in this situation

1353
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:30,335
Where you don't know yet you know you're going to you've already won and all that stuff but you don't know if it's going to go the way you

1354
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:36,735
Really wanted to yet like the idea that he can just say that s*** to you and then not get

1355
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:38,527
Consequences

1356
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:41,599
Terrifying endurance of not like

1357
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:47,743
Because of what Alex does he gives you as much emotion as he can to override your ability to think

1358
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:52,095
Or try Melissa that emotion in you to do get you off the rack

1359
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:58,751
But also I think this clip offers a really good insight into Alex's mind and how these conspiracies work because

1360
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:04,127
If you look at it's basically exactly what we say pretty regularly as what he's articulating

1361
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:10,783
He's season of that that's threatening to his ideology and he knows that he has no actual argument about it and that the people on

1362
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:12,831
The other side of the issue have points

1363
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:15,135
He cannot in any way we're but

1364
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:20,767
Instead of recognizing that and working on strengthening his arguments or attempt to find a compromise solution

1365
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:24,863
Alex takes a shortcut of saying that this threatening event didn't happen

1366
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:31,519
When there's a mass shooting all gun owners aren't blame for it but Alex feels like they are because to him discussion of gun

1367
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:37,407
Regulation isn't a matter of making better public policy it's something that's being done to punish people who have guns

1368
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:44,319
This is obviously an accurate but it serves as a launching pad for Alex to make the leap to where he wants to go which is to say that the

1369
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:45,599
Shooting itself is fake

1370
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:50,207
So there's no reason to punish gun owners which is would not happening to begin with

1371
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:56,095
If I was at the counter the actual argument people who proposed gun regulation or making he would fall flat

1372
01:17:56,351 --> 01:18:02,495
He showed all he has what he went on Piers Morgan show like it's just a bunch of yelling and aggressive statements but there's no

1373
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:03,775
Actual substance there

1374
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:06,079
This is all just intellectual cowardice

1375
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:11,711
Alex can't stand up to the actual ideas in the arena like he likes to think he can

1376
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:16,831
So he takes the shortcut of taking world events personally and then insisting they didn't happen

1377
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:23,487
The event didn't happen because the globalist were really just trying to punish me to begin with so they think this event in order to give them

1378
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:25,023
Justification to do it

1379
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:31,167
You can easily see how this allows Alex to sidestep any actual policy discussions cuz he's not equipped to have them

1380
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:38,079
Also no therapist would allow this kind of justification to stand without further exploration

1381
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:43,711
Clear projection and rationalization that you have to have a normal level therapist in order to accept

1382
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:46,783
And move passage that's outrageous

1383
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:54,207
I know that Alex has gone to some therapist just because of court-ordered stuff with his

1384
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:59,327
Divorce and custody stuff but putting a poor therapist through this

1385
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:02,911
This is this is the one time where there's just not enough money

1386
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:09,567
What reboot of The Sopranos

1387
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:15,967
You have to have a gun to the therapist had to pull that we reboot doctor cat okay all looks awesome. LOL

1388
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:17,503
Call Alex

1389
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:23,903
Rodger Stone personalities

1390
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,439
And we could get Louis c.k. back

1391
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:29,791
Cuz he's also

1392
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:35,167
I feel like I feel like we could be onto something

1393
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:39,775
Don't tell anyone

1394
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:46,431
So Maddie points out here it's very important and that is that like if you believe that the

1395
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:51,551
These people are actors and do know they've just pulled off this fake thing in order to take everyone's guns

1396
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:52,831
You should expose them

1397
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:55,647
That would be the right thing to do right

1398
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:57,951
If you have somebody

1399
01:19:58,719 --> 01:19:59,487
Who's faith

1400
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:01,535
Death is part of a political issue

1401
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:04,095
Disarm the American

1402
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:05,631
Those people

1403
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:11,007
Some of the some of the parents

1404
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:18,432
Advocacy

1405
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:21,248
Advocacy

1406
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:25,088
Spell became political operative

1407
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:27,136
The political Arena

1408
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:31,488
I move to strike the colloquy Council

1409
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:32,256
Home

1410
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:34,816
Change calculated to Mario

1411
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:39,680
Directions to one we wait until the end of the break and you can make your objection

1412
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:44,032
So Alex is basically saying exactly what

1413
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:50,688
Maddie would hope he'd say because they have entered the political Arena

1414
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:55,296
Just kind of making the argument that they're fair game

1415
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:57,344
And so

1416
01:20:57,856 --> 01:21:04,000
This turns into B chaos and correctly what are you saying

1417
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:09,376
Is if you survive or experienced a massive tragedy and tell people about it

1418
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:16,032
Then it is fine to abused you yes unless you tell people about it in a way they

1419
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:22,432
That Alex like a monster

1420
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:23,712
Nah

1421
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:25,760
So yeah chaos man

1422
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:30,368
Directions to why we wait until the end of the break and you can make your objection

1423
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:35,232
I said 1330 objection you know that you are a

1424
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:36,256
Antagonizing

1425
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:39,840
It's terrible on

1426
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:43,936
They had it coming

1427
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:48,800
Now that's a terrible

1428
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:52,128
How dare you say the parents Atacama

1429
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:57,760
You just said that didn't you harass them right now

1430
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:00,064
I think you know what I meant this

1431
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:06,464
You just said

1432
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:11,840
Have you no decency Republican Lena and so they got what they got right

1433
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:15,424
Is Ronnie Parker

1434
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:20,288
He did and I think you should keep mayonnaise anti-gun agenda

1435
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:21,568
Millet

1436
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,360
Use for an anti-gun agenda

1437
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:26,432
Never said a word about guns

1438
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:27,456
Objection

1439
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:28,224
Noah

1440
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:32,320
No I'm sorry for any any pain that I might others caused me to Parker

1441
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,392
Are we done here

1442
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:41,536
The website are you jacking his answer no more.

1443
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,632
Yes this is chaos

1444
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:47,936
I don't like your tone

1445
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:54,336
Yeah I get I get where you felt and I think a lot of the objections that are flying around not necessarily in this club

1446
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:56,640
Throughout some of this early like

1447
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:58,176
Things that are being said as state

1448
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:04,576
That's right you know or at least appear to be saying being cited statements correctly

1449
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:10,720
I mean obviously I don't understand correctly but if I bought I think if I understand is that these depositions

1450
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:12,256
The transcripts

1451
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:14,048
That go to the jury

1452
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:19,424
If the objection is sustained then that section is cut out right

1453
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:25,824
So so it is possible that the transcripts from the jury none of this section was in what they got

1454
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:29,408
I would assume that most of it

1455
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:31,712
Is I mean of course I think

1456
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:34,272
I don't think a lot of these objections are

1457
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:40,672
I think a lot of them are just sort of like what I'm saying is that a lot of people have asked likewise

1458
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:47,072
Is he still answering questions after objection if there's no kind of thing and it's because that's an after-the-fact right

1459
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:53,472
You know everybody would determine the alexwood and there are a couple of instances where this happens

1460
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:59,872
Here one or two of them where Norbit like I'm advising you not to answer it and that's when Alex doesn't answer

1461
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:03,712
Objections that are like

1462
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:10,112
Roll the dice do appreciate the attempt to to bring like the lawyer

1463
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:16,512
Here's town is a problem I appreciate that the lawyers on Alex's side

1464
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:22,912
I totally would probably do the same thing

1465
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:29,312
Question of Rob Jacobson comes up a longtime employee who

1466
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:34,432
Testified in this case key that had a deposition about his time

1467
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:38,784
Working there and Adan Salazar has said

1468
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,320
Also Underoath

1469
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:41,856
That Rob said hey

1470
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:44,672
Should be covering Sandy Hook when all this stuff right

1471
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:45,952
And so

1472
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:47,744
Alex said some pretty

1473
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,048
Shity things to say about Rob Jacobson

1474
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,584
Eli

1475
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,376
To say that I made

1476
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:59,008
More than 1% of the money even in the times I hold shows I covered Sandy Hook

1477
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:04,128
If I got a lot of heat from friends and family and folks to the office

1478
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:08,736
Ariana end and when Watson threatened to quit

1479
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:10,528
Image stop covering it

1480
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:12,320
At times we did

1481
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:13,856
When did he die

1482
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:18,976
Remember a conversation with

1483
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,280
Rob Jacobson work

1484
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:22,304
He told you that

1485
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:24,864
You shouldn't be covered

1486
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,936
In the case of Rob

1487
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:30,240
He is

1488
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:35,104
I know he's claimed that and it's the office that he was the guy that believe Sandy Hook was he

1489
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,640
Use lying about

1490
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:37,408
Warning you

1491
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:38,432
Against

1492
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:39,712
Covington

1493
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,248
Man

1494
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:44,576
Just I just absolutely line because you know that you're

1495
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:46,112
Your employer down Salazar

1496
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:47,648
Acknowledge that heater covers

1497
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:56,608
I know later.

1498
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,144
Throughout most of it

1499
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,704
He was the one bringing up saying you thought it was staged

1500
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:02,752
And I do remember it on saying later

1501
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:04,800
He bought that he also talked to David Knight

1502
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:07,104
Was a alien reptile

1503
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:13,760
And I had really serious breakdown and I'm really sad for Rob and the tax is being exploited by you guys just

1504
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:14,528
Disgusting

1505
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:16,320
It's not familiar

1506
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,392
Do you know that you know what happened to that position

1507
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:21,696
Very sad

1508
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:25,792
I really I just

1509
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:27,072
I don't want to

1510
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,608
Come back for a third day

1511
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:45,248
About 11

1512
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:51,904
So are they end up getting steaks but I cannot watch the Rob Jacobson deposition yet

1513
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:54,464
I don't have that one but hopefully

1514
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:58,816
Will be able to cover that in the future but his lawyers got sanctioned

1515
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:01,120
Because of their behavior in that deposition

1516
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:03,936
He was ruled to be abusive

1517
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:10,336
And they were really really shity yes yes

1518
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:12,640
Usevs yes and got sacked

1519
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:14,176
Because of their behavior

1520
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:18,784
I with Rob and I think Alex is referring to that but as a whole

1521
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:25,184
Objective eyes look at that the deposition is a real bad thing for Alex is gay

1522
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:25,952
Yeah

1523
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:32,352
That sounds right but Alex is a viewing it as as a while we showed it we showed you that it's something

1524
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:37,984
That's amazing to to look at it you're not in a glass-half-full way like that

1525
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:40,800
So Alex is the real victim

1526
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:45,408
When you really think about it and I don't know if that's true what do you think about the whole Sandy Hook thing

1527
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:46,688
Alex is the victim

1528
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:54,112
Dad and and and then was my being wrong about things Purple People absolutely

1529
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:57,184
It was not done consciously and I apologize for that

1530
01:27:57,696 --> 01:28:00,000
I have learned that by becoming very very famous

1531
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:04,864
When you do have power

1532
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:05,632
And

1533
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:08,704
The same time I have suffered by being deplatformed

1534
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,496
Demonize threatened attacked

1535
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:14,080
What I said about Sandy Hook and I have been punished a lot

1536
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:16,640
And that's why I'm not even

1537
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:20,992
This whole Fiasco with trial and Anna and all the media stuff

1538
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:24,832
Is is is is your to me not to because already for the families

1539
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:26,624
You sure like to be from for me

1540
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:29,696
It'll make a nice HBO documentary for everybody so

1541
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:31,488
Do you own

1542
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,048
You feel better

1543
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:37,376
Ura

1544
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:38,656
A victim

1545
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:44,544
That you've been unfairly

1546
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:46,080
Victimized

1547
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:48,640
As a result

1548
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:49,920
You've made

1549
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,320
Let's just say this I wish that I

1550
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:58,368
Knew what I know now

1551
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:02,976
I was younger respected for me

1552
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:04,768
Honest

1553
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:06,816
Say like don't tell them you were delusional

1554
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:11,936
I really believe all that stuff

1555
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:14,752
Other I was saying I would and I was wrong about that

1556
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:17,312
Because so much others have been proven and documented

1557
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:21,408
And any other you start thinking everything's a lie and I've explained that

1558
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,200
And and

1559
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:29,856
Alex won't own his position if he views himself as like the woe-is-me

1560
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:36,256
Person in this whole circumstance I've been kicked off social media been marginalized and all these people

1561
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:39,072
To me that made me say these things and

1562
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:45,472
How the media tricked me with being wrong all the time and so I thought everything was fake and look at me eat

1563
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:51,872
Won't you think of the poor Alex Jones is really just a s******* he was wrong on a lot of

1564
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:53,408
Accountant

1565
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:55,968
But most especially it was

1566
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:57,248
Cathartic

1567
01:29:57,504 --> 01:30:01,344
Turns out I think so yeah it was quite cathartic

1568
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:08,000
In a lot of ways how he would think it wouldn't be he's like well I lost so nobody should be happy right

1569
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:14,400
In his he's required to have a position that they're not really that upset about that it's true

1570
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:16,960
So he would think that whatever catharsis

1571
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:23,360
With a Advil would be fake yeah it's not real

1572
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:29,760
Wouldn't be that big a deal I do like how you accidentally or you're delusional

1573
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:30,784
Something which is like

1574
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:37,440
Clearly this was a conversation what you had with your lawyers about how to lie to what if I said I was crazy

1575
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:44,096
Do you think that would work I believe temporary insanity gears so that's going to be tough

1576
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:56,384
So Megyn Kelly came to interview Alex sure and he presumably

1577
01:30:56,640 --> 01:31:00,992
And he definitely claimed this on are a number of times that he had like

1578
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:04,576
The whole thing recorded he was secretly

1579
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:10,976
Got all of it remember when we covered that he made that very clear turns out that never was true

1580
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:12,512
And there's a funny reason

1581
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:14,560
I want to show you a

1582
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:16,096
Video

1583
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:19,936
Published

1584
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:22,240
June 2017

1585
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:25,568
You recalled it

1586
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:27,360
This was around the time

1587
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:32,480
You didn't interview with Megan

1588
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:33,248
Kelly

1589
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:36,064
Yes

1590
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:40,416
And you had a lot

1591
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:41,696
Complaints about

1592
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:42,720
How she

1593
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:44,768
Presented

1594
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:45,792
That interview

1595
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:47,840
Yes correct

1596
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:48,608
Yes

1597
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:51,424
It was unfair

1598
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,288
Yes remember

1599
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,104
Water jump cuts

1600
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:02,688
I told her I thought Sandy Hook a banshee

1601
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:03,456
So

1602
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:05,760
Then it's me look he's he's denying it again

1603
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:07,552
And and

1604
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:09,600
I hope you can get that rocktape from her

1605
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:11,136
Because

1606
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:14,464
I can talk about Sandy Hook when I come all the stuff

1607
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:17,792

They don't wander

1616
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:41,856
It was

1617
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:43,136
With my sister

1618
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:49,024
Mileage

1619
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:51,584
The minions episode

1620
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:55,424
Despicable Me

1621
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:57,984
He's like the minions

1622
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:00,032
Oh boy

1623
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:01,312
I just

1624
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:07,712
I just you know everytime you think that there's going to be just a very simple explanation for something

1625
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:14,368
Affordable occurs it Alex lives a permanent Force

1626
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:16,928
Door he goes out a different room you know

1627
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:21,024
Who was screwed up a recording they're no longer

1628
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:27,424
Trying to throw someone out of the bus until he remembered it was his

1629
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:33,824
Sister yeah probably

1630
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,616
Supervillain minions wafer Villas

1631
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:39,200
They are evil

1632
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:40,480
Anyway

1633
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:44,320
Remember this game up a little bit on the day one

1634
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:46,368
The notion that

1635
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:47,904
Koskoff firm

1636
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:49,440
Are the mafia

1637
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:53,280
Write this comes back up

1638
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:56,352
Is really wanting Alex to shut up

1639
01:33:56,608 --> 01:33:57,632
And this is called

1640
01:33:58,144 --> 01:33:59,424
Sandy Hook vampires

1641
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:00,960
Remember that

1642
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:02,496
Yes can you title that video

1643
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:08,384
Buy vampire

1644
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:10,688
You're referring to

1645
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:13,248
People who you claim

1646
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:15,808
Get

1647
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:17,600
Energy

1648
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:21,184
And Goodwill as a result of being associated with

1649
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:22,720
Tragedy Coronavirus

1650
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:27,584
And I suspect you put my law firm in that category

1651
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:30,912
Yes

1652
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:34,496
So what's go head and now this is obviously before any

1653
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:36,544
Lawsuit was filed so you could have been referring

1654
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:37,312
Then right

1655
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:40,384
Are you now

1656
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:45,504
He'll disputed the families have a right to

1657
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:46,784
To hire a lawyer if they choose

1658
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:47,552
Correct

1659
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:52,672
Are your thoroughbred ambulance Chaser.. Volume a

1660
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:55,744
From Sandy Hook

1661
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:56,768
Just because I'm a lawyer

1662
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:59,840
You know

1663
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:02,912
Mafia around here

1664
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:04,192
Are okay

1665
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:07,008
So in addition to being an ambulance Chasers where the mafia

1666
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:10,592
I was once told that by member

1667
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:23,648
Confidentiality cribriform I tried to discuss this with you use their ad like an opportunity to do so off the record for a moment you have account

1668
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:25,696
Eventually green with my firm at 2

1669
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:27,744
I'd like to discuss it with

1670
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:32,096
I am the way it was with Josh there was a

1671
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:34,656
Context in which we met and agreed not to discuss thing

1672
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:37,728
This is coming from

1673
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:45,920
Opportunity

1674
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:46,944
For 1 minute

1675
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:54,112
Hernandez

1676
01:35:54,368 --> 01:35:56,928
Important setting at your word never when you can talk about

1677
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:04,864
For any questions about what took place at their reviews

1678
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:11,264
Alright so Norm called you guys the bafia that is an issue that maybe

1679
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:14,080
Yeah they could be

1680
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:22,016
Or conversely

1681
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:26,880
Yeah the converse side of this is not to not realistic I don't think

1682
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:33,280
Then Alex would know if he signed something there was a confidentiality

1683
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:37,632
I am the beat like it so he saying that Josh koskoff

1684
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:44,032
Sign this confidentiality thing

1685
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:45,824
Think that they would know about this

1686
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:52,224
Have you heard a very firm it team on this case and this is all bulshit but

1687
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:56,832
Jumping up to back up later like course

1688
01:36:57,088 --> 01:37:02,720
Norm being like we want to strike all of this of the mafia stuff

1689
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:05,792
You know I think I think Chris is doing a fantastic job

1690
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:12,192
Hair but that one moment I really feel like I want Bill to tag in and just sit there and chew on it

1691
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:18,592
Gummy worm as Norm keeps being like Josh

1692
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:20,384
Let's go ahead and do that right now

1693
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:27,040
So what are those things I think Chris is really good with his being serious about unserious things like the who is it

1694
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:29,088
Vampire

1695
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:31,904
She wanted to know if the judge is a vampire here

1696
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:36,000
Give her a vampire

1697
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:37,536
And your vampire

1698
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:38,816
Objection

1699
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:48,800
I know that we didn't provide fraudulent financials and I know he's my brother gave you has everything you said you have nothing

1700
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:50,336
Do to consider the judge

1701
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:53,152
Empire

1702
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:54,176
Same where you consider

1703
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:58,272
A vampire category

1704
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:01,600
Do

1705
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:06,208
Probably demon rap

1706
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:08,768
What category is families who lost

1707
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:09,536
Loved ones

1708
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:10,304
Sandy Hook

1709
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:13,376
Don't have a right

1710
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:14,400
To seek relief

1711
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:15,168
Through the lawyer

1712
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:21,312
No I think that did that the media and other media and the people that they're actually always hyping it up

1713
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:22,592
Claiming that high

1714
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:25,408
Not true

1715
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:31,296
That they're the vampires so if you become successful off

1716
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:32,320
Danny Gokey

1717
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:33,088
Yourself

1718
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,112
Diorite

1719
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:39,488
I know you're misrepresenting that I did I know that it was a small part of what we did and then

1720
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:43,840
My opposition to Barack Obama during that. It's what exploded show

1721
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:44,864
If it's very weird

1722
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:45,632
Conclude

1723
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:47,168
Actually you did

1724
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:48,448
Garner audience

1725
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:49,984
Revenue as a result of

1726
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:50,752
Your lies.

1727
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:53,056
Sandy Hook

1728
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:53,824
Yourself

1729
01:38:59,456 --> 01:39:03,040
We are with negligible Revenue not really Bill discover almost

1730
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:05,856
Seems like $300 off articles or something

1731
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:10,464
No way that I can tell you the Sandy Hook was not

1732
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:13,280
A revenue generator for us in fact

1733
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:15,840
One of our lizard iguana to the time was very

1734
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:17,632
Controversial deep question

1735
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:21,984
And I still did things like that if I got a 911 I've explained that to you

1736
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:23,264
Audience members

1737
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:24,544
Of yours who

1738
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:25,312
Harassed

1739
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:26,336
My client

1740
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:27,616
They they like

1741
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:35,040
There have been claims that those are my listeners and and much of that some people that I saw on the news that did

1742
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:38,112
Go around some people are not my listeners even though the media center

1743
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:39,904
No true Scotsman

1744
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:46,304
I mean no listener of mine would harass live for

1745
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:52,704
How to get no true Scotsman vampire

1746
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:53,984
Stop and be like

1747
01:39:54,240 --> 01:40:00,384
How did you do that cuz you made my words turn back on me and I don't I don't know how to do that to people never say

1748
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:05,760
Bill made

1749
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:10,624
Has the definition of gone solar I don't understand

1750
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:11,904
Edwards work

1751
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:13,184
They do not

1752
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:19,840
So Alex gets to talk in a year and getting asked a question about Owens video

1753
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:26,240
He defamed Neil heslin relied on the Zero Hedge article

1754
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:29,312
Seem to understand what the issue is there

1755
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:35,456
Now I I don't have to play the the full video for you mister Jones I may just ask you some questions about it see what your call

1756
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:37,504
Of the broadcast for mister

1757
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:38,784
Destroyer clean

1758
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:44,672
That contrary to what your husband said during his interview with Megyn Kelly is not possible

1759
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:46,208
Rachel's healthy

1760
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:46,976
Sun

1761
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:50,816
Chipotle yes

1762
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:55,680
Yeah Shirley characterized would only said on that video he was reading this article

1763
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:01,312
Okay you think that that claim came from zerohedge hat article

1764
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:05,152
Reading is your 100 only talked about it

1765
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:06,944
And and

1766
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:15,136
I dropped him off at school with bookbag picked him up in a body bag

1767
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:19,488
And the people said she wasn't picked up the body back that day so technically that was

1768
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:20,512
Hyperbole

1769
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:24,608
Wish I was like yeah there's nothing at all

1770
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:27,424
I have to Domino's located

1771
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:29,216
Supporters claim

1772
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:30,240
That

1773
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:31,776
It was not

1774
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:35,360
Do it held his son

1775
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:36,384
His arm

1776
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:37,408
After sun

1777
01:41:37,664 --> 01:41:38,176
Murder

1778
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:40,480
You recall him saying

1779
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:46,112
In the context of the body backstory

1780
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:48,416
What's this lady

1781
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:51,232
So Alex seems to be wanting to make the point

1782
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:57,632
Like or the argument that it was exaggeration Owen was accusing them of exaggeration that too

1783
01:41:57,888 --> 01:42:04,032
The issue is he wasn't technically a body bag that's the whole thing I'm just trying to clear up the record I just got to make sure every

1784
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:10,432
Nobody knows this is all a big misunderstanding that's very weird because if that's Alex's understanding

1785
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:11,712
You can't possibly be

1786
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:18,112

01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:37,504
Things like that

1907
01:48:43,904 --> 01:48:44,416

Well okay I guess we're going to have to move to

1910
01:48:52,352 --> 01:48:52,864
Until you

1911
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:56,192
It disclosed I'll see you for stores

1912
01:48:57,472 --> 01:48:58,496

Oroville

1914
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,848
Crime committed by the United States government this

1915
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:03,872
Describes

1916
01:49:04,128 --> 01:49:06,176
Pieces of information that identity

1917
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:09,504
It will move to compel that

1918
01:49:10,272 --> 01:49:13,600
There's there's not going to be an ass I'm going to be

1919
01:49:13,856 --> 01:49:18,208
Disappointment

1920
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:24,864
So then what's going on here is it Alex's combining the Las Vegas shooting

1921
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:29,472
Being and when MBS took power Saudi Arabia when he

1922
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:32,800
Help people at the Ritz-Carlton named yeah

1923
01:49:33,056 --> 01:49:39,200
There was that Purge in the in the government so Alex has turned the Las Vegas shooting into a Prelude

1924
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:40,224
Said that

1925
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:45,088
And then Trump orchestrated I guess a regime change in Saudi Arabia

1926
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:50,464
I mean somebody who has I was his political sat in his beliefs

1927
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:56,864
He should be totally cool with that he should be totally fine with Trump secretly installing it

1928
01:49:57,120 --> 01:50:02,496
Different governments share is a sovereign country

1929
01:50:02,752 --> 01:50:03,264
Yeah

1930
01:50:03,776 --> 01:50:09,920
And it's worked out really well for the like things that Alex values in a free Society

1931
01:50:10,176 --> 01:50:12,480
So it all is for the good

1932
01:50:12,992 --> 01:50:14,784
I don't know

1933
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:16,320
If I can get over

1934
01:50:16,832 --> 01:50:18,368
Some of these groups have no name

1935
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:21,952
Delivery of solid the best

1936
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:24,000
Way to answer that question

1937
01:50:24,256 --> 01:50:29,376
There's no other answer cuz you you're either going to make up a name drive or you're just going to say I don't know

1938
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:30,912
But coming in with

1939
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:37,312
They have no names like f****** Batman why would they have known you're a fool

1940
01:50:37,568 --> 01:50:43,712
Fool yourself sound dumb ask him if

1941
01:50:43,968 --> 01:50:50,112
Name the Trump installed a new Saturday regime because he was practicing to do

1942
01:50:50,368 --> 01:50:56,512
I know that I heard Alexei some of that stuff like on his show and what has he written deposition

1943
01:50:56,768 --> 01:50:57,792
It feels

1944
01:50:58,304 --> 01:51:01,376
Like he really thinks that's how it happened

1945
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:08,032
That is a thing he believes his tone has like more of a like I think you're actually saying this

1946
01:51:08,288 --> 01:51:12,384
I've been a lot of his other clients on comfortable ground

1947
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:18,784
And he say he has the tone that he feels proud that he knows it

1948
01:51:19,552 --> 01:51:20,576
Poor guy

1949
01:51:20,832 --> 01:51:25,952
So he is the topic of pizzagate comes up short and Alex discusses this tiny bit

1950
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:32,352
And then is a little bit wishy-washy about whether or not that shooting actually even happened at the pizzeria

1951
01:51:32,608 --> 01:51:33,120
You familiar with

1952
01:51:34,144 --> 01:51:34,656

1961
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:47,712
Pizzeria in Washington

1962
01:51:50,272 --> 01:51:51,296

1970
01:52:07,424 --> 01:52:08,192
Chose

1971
01:52:08,704 --> 01:52:10,240
Your claims that

1972
01:52:11,008 --> 01:52:11,776
80

1973
01:52:13,568 --> 01:52:14,336
Restaurant

1974
01:52:14,592 --> 01:52:16,128
Ping pong in Washington

1975
01:52:16,384 --> 01:52:16,896
AC

1976
01:52:17,152 --> 01:52:19,200
Was actually being used by

1977
01:52:19,712 --> 01:52:20,480
High level

1978
01:52:20,736 --> 01:52:21,504
Democrats

1979
01:52:22,272 --> 01:52:23,040
As a site for

1980
01:52:23,808 --> 01:52:24,576
Sexual trafficking

1981
01:52:26,112 --> 01:52:27,648
I covered the news covering it

1982
01:52:27,904 --> 01:52:29,952
Was nowhere near creating a story

1983
01:52:30,976 --> 01:52:33,024
Did you ever assert to your audience that that wasn't the

1984
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:34,048
Prove it

1985
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:35,584
Comet Ping Pong

1986
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:36,864
Was he fat

1987
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:37,632
And you

1988
01:52:39,168 --> 01:52:39,936
I do location

1989
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:40,704
4

1990
01:52:42,752 --> 01:52:44,544
No I did

1991
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,336
Talk about some of people there

1992
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:48,384
Like Tony podesta

1993
01:52:48,896 --> 01:52:50,176
Other stepdaughter

1994
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:54,784
Nerf

1995
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:56,064
Taste of Texas

1996
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:58,368
How was the restaurant

1997
01:52:58,624 --> 01:52:59,136
Connected to that

1998
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:02,208
Add fundraisers there there was a lot of Art

1999
01:53:02,464 --> 01:53:02,976
Weird

2000
01:53:03,232 --> 01:53:04,512
Stories that weren't true

2001
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:07,584
About basements and all the rest of that stuff

2002
01:53:08,096 --> 01:53:13,216
We picked up and cover solo stories were first on 4chan hm and picked up by the mainstream is

2003
01:53:13,728 --> 01:53:15,264
Whelen debating cupboard weather

2004
01:53:16,544 --> 01:53:18,080
That was true or not and

2005
01:53:19,104 --> 01:53:20,384
Wild

2006
01:53:24,224 --> 01:53:27,040
Whether or not that that place was being used

2007
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:28,576
For the child trafficking

2008
01:53:29,088 --> 01:53:33,440
That is discussed in a regulation in your testimony is that you never

2009
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:36,000
Stated that it was in fact being used for that

2010
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:44,448
We we did reports on it and then read the reports I'm just asking you

2011
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:45,472
Waiter

2012
01:53:45,728 --> 01:53:47,264
What your testimony is are you

2013
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:49,312
Testifying today that

2014
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:50,592
You never

2015
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:51,872
Started on your show

2016
01:53:52,384 --> 01:53:53,920
That the Comet Ping Pong

2017
01:53:54,432 --> 01:53:55,200
Was a child

2018
01:53:55,456 --> 01:53:55,968
Sex traffic

2019
01:53:56,992 --> 01:53:58,272
I I never said

2020
01:53:58,528 --> 01:53:59,296
Myself

2021
01:53:59,552 --> 01:54:00,832
But that was certainly happening

2022
01:54:01,856 --> 01:54:02,624
Wow

2023
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:03,648
You said

2024
01:54:04,416 --> 01:54:06,208
When you say you never said it was certainly happen

2025
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:07,744
Did you ever say what's happening

2026
01:54:10,816 --> 01:54:11,328
But

2027
01:54:13,888 --> 01:54:16,192
A gentleman named Edgar Maddison Welch

2028
01:54:16,704 --> 01:54:17,472
When shut off.

2029
01:54:17,728 --> 01:54:18,496
Pizzeria correct

2030
01:54:21,056 --> 01:54:22,336
And are you

2031
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:23,872
You have doubts about that

2032
01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:28,736
A shot up

2033
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:30,784
Open fire in the pizza

2034
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:33,600
You read that

2035
01:54:34,368 --> 01:54:35,648
No I don't want to shop

2036
01:54:35,904 --> 01:54:38,208
I think those stinky like shot into a

2037
01:54:38,464 --> 01:54:39,488
Bores a wall

2038
01:54:39,744 --> 01:54:42,048
Okay see you agree that he shot in the restaurant

2039
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:44,352
Restaurant before.

2040
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:45,376
An open fire

2041
01:54:48,704 --> 01:54:50,240
Okay and you believe that be true

2042
01:54:52,544 --> 01:54:54,080
It's very bizarre

2043
01:54:54,336 --> 01:54:57,152
That's a strange

2044
01:54:57,664 --> 01:54:59,712
Level of just need your

2045
01:54:59,968 --> 01:55:06,112
Dial that one's just complete like I just refused to agree with you on princess

2046
01:55:06,368 --> 01:55:09,184
Yeah it's Defiance for its own sake

2047
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:11,232
I'm Alex Jones I'm not just going to say this happen

2048
01:55:11,488 --> 01:55:13,792
You're going to need to really fight me

2049
01:55:14,048 --> 01:55:20,192
Before I will just be like yes yeah I've walked into too many rakes today

2050
01:55:20,448 --> 01:55:26,592
Jammed up a little so no it didn't happen interest me

2051
01:55:26,848 --> 01:55:29,920
Interest me what he said debates is because I I do feel like

2052
01:55:30,688 --> 01:55:35,552
The more I hear them continually talk about it the more I think that they believe

2053
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:37,600
They were having debates

2054
01:55:37,856 --> 01:55:39,648
Not on the show

2055
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:46,304
But baby leave their show is in conversation with the rest of the mainstream media that's interesting you know what I'm saying

2056
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:47,328
I

2057
01:55:47,584 --> 01:55:50,144
I wonder if you're over reading it

2058
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:55,776
That is an interesting way to look at it from an outside perspective

2059
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:58,848
That it that is an argument that he could make

2060
01:55:59,104 --> 01:56:05,248
It would be bad for him still not a good idea know if you viewed himself as being in Dubai

2061
01:56:05,504 --> 01:56:06,016
Play with

2062
01:56:06,272 --> 01:56:10,624
The mainstream Media or whatever his perception of the mainstream

2063
01:56:11,136 --> 01:56:12,416
Then that's fine

2064
01:56:12,672 --> 01:56:17,024
But it doesn't excuse or absolve him of his his actions even in the slightest

2065
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:18,048
No

2066
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:24,192
And it also is really surreal to have like his him saying that like I was reporting on things

2067
01:56:24,704 --> 01:56:25,216
That

2068
01:56:25,472 --> 01:56:31,616
4chan and eight Chan were saying that the mainstream media reported on the couch

2069
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:38,016
New York Times was using 4chan as a source

2070
01:56:38,272 --> 01:56:40,832
Big try not to do that yeah good idea

2071
01:56:41,088 --> 01:56:45,696
But that is his perception of like the mainstream media I guess

2072
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:52,352
Yeah it is a fascinating thing to me because he really does you know it in normally it wouldn't

2073
01:56:52,608 --> 01:56:55,680
Big sense but I do think he thinks he's talking to the TV

2074
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:05,664
You are correct I think that you have an interesting like sort of textual analysis

2075
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:12,064
How's that

2076
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:17,184
Pressing it I think he's really just trying to evade responsibility for the things he's saying by pretending

2077
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:21,280
That they were just talking about how is this possible

2078
01:57:21,536 --> 01:57:24,096
Well I'm sure he's trying to think of more like

2079
01:57:24,352 --> 01:57:29,472
You know we had climate debates where we had at expert who said this and then we said this

2080
01:57:29,728 --> 01:57:35,872
Kind of just the standard evasion of like

2081
01:57:36,128 --> 01:57:42,272
And all sides deeper inside their brains can you believe the people should all rest for having

2082
01:57:42,528 --> 01:57:44,576
Reviews conversation

2083
01:57:45,088 --> 01:57:51,232
Rogan talking to Matt Walsh just leave out the part where there's other ideas

2084
01:57:51,488 --> 01:57:57,632
They're being so tired we lose debate so we have debates without the other side that's the way we do it

2085
01:57:57,888 --> 01:58:04,032
Two really interesting line of discussion comes up and that is whether or not Alex's audience should trust

2086
01:58:04,288 --> 01:58:05,824
Tim and

2087
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:07,104
I agree with Alex here

2088
01:58:07,872 --> 01:58:08,384
I want to just

2089
01:58:09,152 --> 01:58:09,664
See if you can

2090
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:15,808
You want your audience

2091
01:58:21,184 --> 01:58:23,488
You know I just get up there and say what I think

2092
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:27,072
I really actually don't try to get the glove mirror

2093
01:58:27,584 --> 01:58:29,120
Hayden area that I just took

2094
01:58:30,144 --> 01:58:30,656
If you get on the truck

2095
01:58:33,216 --> 01:58:34,752
No I'm not a question

2096
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:38,592
Got a creeper Banner I'll give you the trust me I'm just I'm just out there

2097
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:41,920
All my guns at once and try to explode the specs

2098
01:58:43,712 --> 01:58:44,224
Wow

2099
01:58:45,248 --> 01:58:46,016
So you don't care

2100
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:53,440
No I really don't I really just try to be truthful

2101
01:58:57,536 --> 01:58:58,816
What I do is

2102
01:58:59,072 --> 01:59:00,352
Find Saugus at tires

2103
01:59:00,608 --> 01:59:01,120
News

2104
01:59:03,168 --> 01:59:04,192
Angry rage

2105
01:59:05,472 --> 01:59:07,008
Real

2106
01:59:07,264 --> 01:59:07,776
So

2107
01:59:09,568 --> 01:59:10,336
I guess then

2108
01:59:13,664 --> 01:59:14,432
Junior audience

2109
01:59:15,456 --> 01:59:16,480
Or should they not

2110
01:59:18,784 --> 01:59:22,112
Trust me

2111
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:26,464
I'm trying to tell the truth

2112
01:59:29,024 --> 01:59:33,120
I die I think that is already and shouldn't trust him I agree

2113
01:59:33,376 --> 01:59:36,192
Iib mutable yeah yeah

2114
01:59:36,448 --> 01:59:40,800
Now this introduces an interesting problem for Alex

2115
01:59:41,056 --> 01:59:42,336
It's so wet

2116
01:59:43,104 --> 01:59:45,920
This is just a great question for the lawyer to be asking

2117
01:59:46,176 --> 01:59:52,320
Should your audience trust you and if you say yes they should trust me then that you're telling them

2118
01:59:52,576 --> 01:59:57,696
These people are actors and you know they should just take you at your word at this you're misleading people and

2119
01:59:57,952 --> 02:00:00,000
But if you say no

2120
02:00:00,256 --> 02:00:06,400
Then it becomes a they will you were saying these people are actors if they don't trust you but you want them to look

2121
02:00:06,656 --> 02:00:07,424
Came to this stuff

2122
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:13,824
Where does that lead us realizes he's at

2123
02:00:18,176 --> 02:00:19,200
Right Sogo

2124
02:00:19,456 --> 02:00:20,736
Verify when I'm

2125
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:23,296
When you say go

2126
02:00:23,808 --> 02:00:25,088
Consciously

2127
02:00:25,344 --> 02:00:26,368
I do say that

2128
02:00:27,904 --> 02:00:31,232
So I should go be mean to somebody but that was even really correcting peep

2129
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:33,792
Play some Cartier

2130
02:00:34,048 --> 02:00:37,376
Your narrative essay with investigating Sandy Hook

2131
02:00:37,632 --> 02:00:43,008
You aren't telling them the best

2132
02:00:43,264 --> 02:00:44,800
That's ridiculous. You're right

2133
02:00:49,664 --> 02:00:52,224
My clients were crisis actors and they

2134
02:00:52,992 --> 02:00:55,040
What are you unmask them for being involved

2135
02:00:56,576 --> 02:01:01,952
I mean there's been a lot of examples of stuff you guys have said about me on the news and I know it's not true and it's meant to make people hate me

2136
02:01:02,464 --> 02:01:03,744
Play some crazy person

2137
02:01:04,256 --> 02:01:06,048
Is

2138
02:01:09,888 --> 02:01:13,472
That person in their actions it's up to them

2139
02:01:13,984 --> 02:01:16,032
Or your neighbor does something wrong to you go to jail too

2140
02:01:19,872 --> 02:01:23,712
Mostly peaceful protest go out and confront people

2141
02:01:23,968 --> 02:01:28,064
If twins we're not going to accept it and don't Republicans do it it's the worst thing ever

2142
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:30,880
But Democrats at the whole thing about it you'll get it

2143
02:01:31,136 --> 02:01:32,928
Everyone knows I got problems

2144
02:01:33,184 --> 02:01:36,256
Because they know it's a train wreck sometimes but it's real

2145
02:01:36,768 --> 02:01:38,304
I know I've got problems

2146
02:01:53,664 --> 02:01:59,808
Logical female the mammal species

2147
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:02,880
You're not crazy

2148
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:09,280
Acolyte

2149
02:02:09,536 --> 02:02:11,584
Thank you

2150
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:19,264
This all spiraled out of control because Alex realizes that no matter where you go with the question

2151
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:20,032
Turn of trust

2152
02:02:20,288 --> 02:02:24,640
Especially when he was saying trust but verify at least it's don't matter what

2153
02:02:24,896 --> 02:02:25,920
Angle he takes

2154
02:02:26,176 --> 02:02:26,688
He's f*****

2155
02:02:26,944 --> 02:02:32,064
It leads down the road where the lawyer is going to have him pinned down on something he does not want to

2156
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:35,904
Be involved in so he starts throwing around the what is a woman thing

2157
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:42,304
You'll because that is meant to elicit an emotional response in the person that he's talking to before it generally he can get

2158
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:48,704
Get out of any of these tight situations with that SHINee key it just doesn't work

2159
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:53,056
I mean it if he might as well have screamed free Charles Manson

2160
02:02:53,312 --> 02:02:59,456
Like it is Alexis what I told somebody to do something and then they did it that's not my fault

2161
02:02:59,968 --> 02:03:06,112
Well by some logic Irene it eat his it is so funny cuz he does suddenly realize like

2162
02:03:06,368 --> 02:03:07,648
So if they trust me

2163
02:03:07,904 --> 02:03:13,280
I said that they weren't real they were crisis actors and then they went and behave that way

2164
02:03:13,536 --> 02:03:14,816
And if they didn't trust me

2165
02:03:15,072 --> 02:03:21,216
They went to investigate because I told them that they were crisis actors I told people that we should look into this

2166
02:03:21,472 --> 02:03:25,568
We have to invade trust but verify how do you verify

2167
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:26,848
Screwed

2168
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:28,384
So they take a break

2169
02:03:28,896 --> 02:03:32,992
And turns out that Alex shot a little video during the break

2170
02:03:33,504 --> 02:03:39,648
They'll need to get some feeling back if you know like he's got it

2171
02:03:39,904 --> 02:03:41,952
Something

2172
02:03:46,048 --> 02:03:46,560
During lunch break

2173
02:03:48,352 --> 02:03:48,864
Video

2174
02:03:49,632 --> 02:03:50,144
Tubi

2175
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:51,424
Broadcast over your website

2176
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:53,472
No

2177
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:54,752
Say what

2178
02:03:57,056 --> 02:03:58,080
Did you make another video

2179
02:03:58,848 --> 02:03:59,360
No

2180
02:04:00,128 --> 02:04:00,640
Did you give an interview

2181
02:04:00,896 --> 02:04:01,920
Meet the Press

2182
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:04,480
During that interview

2183
02:04:04,736 --> 02:04:05,248
With press

2184
02:04:05,504 --> 02:04:06,016
You

2185
02:04:06,272 --> 02:04:06,784
Stated that

2186
02:04:09,856 --> 02:04:10,368
The planets today

2187
02:04:10,624 --> 02:04:11,136
I figured episode

2188
02:04:13,184 --> 02:04:14,720
I just thought it wasn't talked about the devastation

2189
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:18,048
Just what you mean of you

2190
02:04:19,072 --> 02:04:20,096
Animal correct that you said

2191
02:04:21,376 --> 02:04:21,888
That

2192
02:04:22,144 --> 02:04:22,912
The plaintiffs that ass

2193
02:04:23,168 --> 02:04:23,680
At your death

2194
02:04:25,728 --> 02:04:31,104
I just know you guys had asked for deposition is to be accomplished lemon told that before not talk about their position

2195
02:04:34,688 --> 02:04:35,968
I haven't designated your

2196
02:04:36,224 --> 02:04:36,736
Deposition

2197
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:43,392
You can talk about that with your Warner

2198
02:04:44,928 --> 02:04:46,720
Why do you want the deposition be confidential

2199
02:04:47,232 --> 02:04:49,280
I know you guys will take Snippets out of it

2200
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:52,864
Carpet bombing campaign to biosignature E

2201
02:04:53,376 --> 02:04:55,424
I like to be on trial

2202
02:04:58,752 --> 02:04:59,776
Like pieces of it

2203
02:05:00,032 --> 02:05:00,544
Well

2204
02:05:01,056 --> 02:05:02,592
Why don't you

2205
02:05:02,848 --> 02:05:04,128
Publishing entire

2206
02:05:06,432 --> 02:05:08,992
Banana Kong YouTube edited version

2207
02:05:10,528 --> 02:05:11,296
Well mr. Jones

2208
02:05:14,368 --> 02:05:16,160
Yesterday you discussed your

2209
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:17,952
To your audience

2210
02:05:19,488 --> 02:05:22,304
But I discussed the fact that you were like the Niners New World Order

2211
02:05:25,888 --> 02:05:26,400
Okay

2212
02:05:27,168 --> 02:05:28,192
All right you've been claiming

2213
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:29,728
To your audience

2214
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:31,264
For years that

2215
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:32,544
This litigation is part of an F

2216
02:05:33,824 --> 02:05:34,336
Yes

2217
02:05:35,104 --> 02:05:36,896
But when you have an opportunity to

2218
02:05:37,152 --> 02:05:37,664
Testimony

2219
02:05:38,432 --> 02:05:38,944
Defend yourself

2220
02:05:39,456 --> 02:05:39,968
You want to keep that

2221
02:05:46,112 --> 02:05:47,136
Federal cancel trial

2222
02:05:47,648 --> 02:05:48,416
We can ask

2223
02:05:48,672 --> 02:05:50,208
You know about that

2224
02:05:50,976 --> 02:05:52,768
Patachou

2225
02:05:53,024 --> 02:05:54,560
Also I think I was talking about us

2226
02:05:55,072 --> 02:05:57,376
100%

2227
02:06:02,496 --> 02:06:08,640
Boy alex heavily from

2228
02:06:08,896 --> 02:06:15,040
Peace about himself in Rolling Stone for his bio

2229
02:06:15,296 --> 02:06:18,624
As she is reading out Alex's bio

2230
02:06:19,136 --> 02:06:22,720
And there's something else in that Rolling Stone article that maybe

2231
02:06:23,744 --> 02:06:24,256
Alex

2232
02:06:24,512 --> 02:06:25,024
Should not

2233
02:06:25,536 --> 02:06:26,560
Know about

2234
02:06:27,328 --> 02:06:29,632
Read that Rolling Stone article

2235
02:06:31,936 --> 02:06:34,496
And so you're aware that that article also

2236
02:06:36,544 --> 02:06:37,824
Described

2237
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:39,872
A gentleman named Byron Williams

2238
02:06:40,896 --> 02:06:42,944
Who was arrested following a gun battle

2239
02:06:43,456 --> 02:06:44,736
California police

2240
02:06:44,992 --> 02:06:45,760
And was

2241
02:06:46,272 --> 02:06:47,296
Hey Abbott

2242
02:06:47,808 --> 02:06:50,368
Listener of yours your call that I don't remember

2243
02:06:52,672 --> 02:06:55,232
So you don't remember that the article described Mr Williams

2244
02:06:55,744 --> 02:06:57,280
As a devotee of yours

2245
02:06:57,792 --> 02:07:00,096
Who was arrested when he was on his way to shoot up

2246
02:07:00,352 --> 02:07:01,376
An organization called the

2247
02:07:01,632 --> 02:07:02,400
Tides Foundation

2248
02:07:03,168 --> 02:07:04,448
Sorry about that

2249
02:07:05,216 --> 02:07:07,520
Well that's this is Geodon on your website

2250
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:10,080
You probably wouldn't have featured

2251
02:07:11,616 --> 02:07:13,152
Is going to shoot up

2252
02:07:14,944 --> 02:07:15,968
The tides Foundation

2253
02:07:17,504 --> 02:07:18,016
Session

2254
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:20,320
I don't see that part

2255
02:07:21,344 --> 02:07:22,880
It's not on your website

2256
02:07:23,136 --> 02:07:25,440
Can you show me the quote

2257
02:07:25,696 --> 02:07:27,744
I don't have the article as an exhibit

2258
02:07:28,512 --> 02:07:30,816
I'm saying you don't remember that part of the article

2259
02:07:34,912 --> 02:07:41,056
Glenn Beck thing

2260
02:07:47,712 --> 02:07:48,224
Foundation

2261
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:53,344
He is bad at this totally off-the-hook though because his conspiracy stuff feeds into back

2262
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:59,744
Ampex whole thing about the tides Foundation traced back to being another Soros Puppet Master narrative

2263
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,816
So basically the same s*** with slightly different labels

2264
02:08:03,584 --> 02:08:06,656
Is also a reader of Infowars

2265
02:08:06,912 --> 02:08:09,216
And his jailhouse confession he said quote

2266
02:08:09,472 --> 02:08:11,008
I'm actually mad at Fox

2267
02:08:11,264 --> 02:08:14,336
I'm mad at them because they go on to something else

2268
02:08:14,592 --> 02:08:18,176
It's like they drop the issue and it lands on a shelf somewhere to collect dust

2269
02:08:18,432 --> 02:08:19,968
And that's what's happening to the truth

2270
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:22,016
It's going around collecting dust

2271
02:08:22,272 --> 02:08:28,416
How do you say you're not going to let these people get away with this stuff you can't let them get away with it so this was my

2272
02:08:28,672 --> 02:08:30,208
Play action because of foxes neglect

2273
02:08:31,232 --> 02:08:33,024
This isn't an insane perspective

2274
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:37,376
Is it a logical endpoint of the narrative the people like Alex and Beck disseminate

2275
02:08:37,888 --> 02:08:44,032
This guy is expressing an understandable disappointment that these people who claim to have uncovered the truth of these grandkids

2276
02:08:44,544 --> 02:08:50,688
Didn't move on to some other topic and they never actually do anything's weird doesn't it obviously it's not rational.

2277
02:08:50,944 --> 02:08:57,088
Shoot up a foundation but it makes total sense for someone who believes in someone like Alex or back to get to the point where they've had in

2278
02:08:57,344 --> 02:08:58,880
Enough with the inaction

2279
02:08:59,136 --> 02:09:05,280
Why isn't anybody doing anything it's that tension State Alex Glenn Beck propaganda

2280
02:09:05,536 --> 02:09:07,584
Is meant to keep people are

2281
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:10,144
Some people will inevitably

2282
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:16,544
Break under that to that that amount of tension right it's designed that feature you're essentially telling me the

2283
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:21,664
The only way to save the world is to do something and then the next day you're moving on to a different thing

2284
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:23,200
How is that possible

2285
02:09:23,456 --> 02:09:26,784
Yeah and it's like well yeah he's the problem is

2286
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:33,184
He's making rational choices within a framework of insanity yeah yeah yeah

2287
02:09:34,208 --> 02:09:34,976
Yeah

2288
02:09:35,488 --> 02:09:41,632
Somebody brings up Matthew Mills the guy who Alex had on his show and then ended up harassing people at

2289
02:09:41,888 --> 02:09:43,680
Episode of Family Memorial Run

2290
02:09:43,936 --> 02:09:50,080
And Alex failing to answer if he knew that Matthew Mills was a listener

2291
02:09:50,336 --> 02:09:50,848
Movie show

2292
02:09:51,616 --> 02:09:54,944
I don't remember all this

2293
02:09:55,200 --> 02:10:00,576
The transmission

2294
02:10:01,344 --> 02:10:02,112
That's what you meant.

2295
02:10:03,392 --> 02:10:07,232
That he was a listener I don't remember this remember vague amount that was hard to see it

2296
02:10:07,488 --> 02:10:08,000
Well

2297
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:10,304
So you doodling Wellness

2298
02:10:12,608 --> 02:10:14,400
No I want to see it I'd like you just pay attention

2299
02:10:14,656 --> 02:10:16,960
Just I'm relaxing listen to you

2300
02:10:17,984 --> 02:10:21,824
I get the feeling that you're not taking this very seriously if you're doodling throughout the question

2301
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:22,592
Distraction

2302
02:10:26,944 --> 02:10:28,480
It doesn't take much brain power do

2303
02:10:29,248 --> 02:10:31,552
So I'd like you to focus me off when I get brain power

2304
02:10:31,808 --> 02:10:32,832
Tell me what you meant

2305
02:10:33,088 --> 02:10:33,856
When you said

2306
02:10:34,112 --> 02:10:35,904
He is a listener of the transmission

2307
02:10:36,416 --> 02:10:38,464
Don't take much brainpower to doodle

2308
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:44,864
I mean honestly in in my in my understanding I think it is him being he's been

2309
02:10:45,120 --> 02:10:51,264
Better able to answer your questions I think if he is doodling at the same time he had his blanket

2310
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:53,824
100%

2311
02:10:54,080 --> 02:11:00,224
I meant think about like some of this other stuff I've been I don't really know how to articulate it exactly but there's this

2312
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:01,504
Trim that I see

2313
02:11:02,016 --> 02:11:05,088
Where is so much stuff is about like

2314
02:11:05,344 --> 02:11:07,136
They say were bad people

2315
02:11:07,392 --> 02:11:13,536
Or I didn't say to be mean to him the articulation and the way that Alex labels people is

2316
02:11:13,792 --> 02:11:19,936
People harassing victims families is being mean to them

2317
02:11:20,192 --> 02:11:25,568
A very childish prism that he looks through I don't exactly know

2318
02:11:26,080 --> 02:11:32,224
I don't know how to phrase it any better than that or give any more depth to it it's pretty consistent

2319
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:33,504
This Doodlebug is just

2320
02:11:34,016 --> 02:11:40,160
Just another amped-up version of it really I really think if you had like a you know that

2321
02:11:40,416 --> 02:11:46,560
The Pediatrics who who like have the stages of growth you know Alexa

2322
02:11:46,816 --> 02:11:51,168
About right the 98th percentile in scores from 6 to 8 or something like that

2323
02:11:51,424 --> 02:11:54,496
You could cause you can flat Alex into the 628

2324
02:11:55,008 --> 02:11:55,520
Easy

2325
02:11:55,776 --> 02:11:57,568
I think an argument could be made

2326
02:11:57,824 --> 02:11:59,104
So

2327
02:11:59,360 --> 02:12:04,224
YouTube. Where Alex is being made to read things

2328
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:06,016
And how's it going

2329
02:12:06,272 --> 02:12:09,600
It's actually reads better than you would have expected

2330
02:12:09,856 --> 02:12:12,928
But this is going to be there's a little bit of like

2331
02:12:13,184 --> 02:12:19,328
Some stuff that's kind of amusing and then this will lead into something that is pretty tough

2332
02:12:19,584 --> 02:12:25,728
I'll give a warning before we get to that because we're Alex's reading from

2333
02:12:25,984 --> 02:12:32,128
The first responder EMTs report normally probably wouldn't put it

2334
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:38,784
I think that there is a value to it closer to it for now Alex Reid

2335
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:43,648
A comment from his website which he understandably does not wanted imagine

2336
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:45,696
You see that comment left 5

2337
02:12:46,208 --> 02:12:47,744
Fastest speaker 2.0

2338
02:12:49,024 --> 02:12:49,536
Yes

2339
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:52,864
Can you read that for me please

2340
02:12:53,888 --> 02:12:57,728
You want me to read random, so the internet now so it's in my voice range Bo

2341
02:12:57,984 --> 02:13:01,312
Well I think it's not a random comedy Internet it's a comment on your website

2342
02:13:01,824 --> 02:13:05,152
But I mean you can go to YouTube and find some of this right now

2343
02:13:07,968 --> 02:13:09,760
What ligouri the storms of this works

2344
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:11,808
Publix.

2345
02:13:13,856 --> 02:13:14,624
The rules

2346
02:13:15,648 --> 02:13:16,160
Can only a check

2347
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:21,792
Is it necessary to read it aloud

2348
02:13:22,048 --> 02:13:22,816
Dear Daddy

2349
02:13:23,584 --> 02:13:28,704
But I mean this is somebody why you want me to say bad things somebody around, so that's not that's that's just dirty

2350
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:31,264
Can you

2351
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:33,056
But I'm not the witness not anymore

2352
02:13:38,176 --> 02:13:42,784
So Alex goes on to read it and listen to this is amazing

2353
02:13:43,552 --> 02:13:45,856
Sandy Hooks 2-year anniversary

2354
02:13:46,624 --> 02:13:47,904

Experts are really enjoying

2357
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:58,400
Your house must give house number Alex Jones and outrageously I didn't rape you

2358
02:13:58,912 --> 02:14:00,960
The three found nobody yet Lenny

02:14:01,216 --> 02:14:04,544
Trying using Kevin for your certainty start HBO show this

2360
02:14:05,056 --> 02:14:08,896
Founding over yet Lenny trying using Kevin for your search engine name

2361
02:14:09,152 --> 02:14:10,944
He's not a Talbots

2362
02:14:12,224 --> 02:14:16,832
Or also hope all your anus round around Walker's have found your way home

2363
02:14:17,600 --> 02:14:20,928
If I brought Emily a new dress yet Robbie

2364
02:14:21,696 --> 02:14:22,976
Can I drive to Cersei this

2365
02:14:23,232 --> 02:14:27,072
This is not my idea that

2366
02:14:27,328 --> 02:14:33,472
Who's the same thing in the first day of deposition so he wouldn't say people's names presumably because

2367
02:14:33,728 --> 02:14:39,872
Because he thought they would edit it it was covering for him not knowing anybody's name

2368
02:14:40,128 --> 02:14:41,920
Time it does feel like he's like

2369
02:14:42,176 --> 02:14:47,040
They're going to make me say these things and then this will be a Sizzle reel

2370
02:14:47,296 --> 02:14:48,576
Which is bizarre

2371
02:14:48,832 --> 02:14:53,696
It is it is indicative of how he would have let you know like he's Young

2372
02:14:53,952 --> 02:15:00,096
Telling you this is what I would do to you a hundred percent

2373
02:15:00,352 --> 02:15:02,656
He's like this is the way it's done

2374
02:15:03,168 --> 02:15:04,448
How do I know that

2375
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:05,984
I do it

2376
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:09,568
That's what he said that's what he's doing he's like what you don't understand the business

2377
02:15:09,824 --> 02:15:15,968
Write it because of the tiny clip of Robbie Parker that I showed over and over again

2378
02:15:16,224 --> 02:15:19,296
Yep yeah that's probably part of his mental process

2379
02:15:19,808 --> 02:15:23,136
So here is where we're going to get to the the difficult part

2380
02:15:23,648 --> 02:15:26,208
If you have

2381
02:15:26,720 --> 02:15:29,024
You know sensitivity about

2382
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:33,120
Graphic depictions are imagery about the

2383
02:15:33,376 --> 02:15:36,704
Aftermath of the shooting and Skip forward

2384
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:43,104
Hello maybe 20 minutes it's this is a long clip but there's a reason

2385
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:49,504
Could something happens throughout it that I think it's critical to to keep track of and understand

2386
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:51,808
Matt is the as Alex's reading this

2387
02:15:52,320 --> 02:15:53,088
Pay attention

2388
02:15:53,344 --> 02:15:57,184
Because you can see him trying to come up with conspiracies

2389
02:15:57,440 --> 02:15:59,488
As he's reading the EMTs report

2390
02:15:59,744 --> 02:16:03,840
It's fascinating but also really the juxtaposition of

2391
02:16:04,096 --> 02:16:08,448
Alex's voice reading this is really dark and grotesque yeah

2392
02:16:08,704 --> 02:16:11,008
There's another added element of like

2393
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:13,568
It's really difficult to escape from

2394
02:16:14,080 --> 02:16:18,688
The awareness of like this is what he lies about yeah you know like

2395
02:16:18,944 --> 02:16:22,272
Hearing these details and just recognizing that this is Ban

2396
02:16:22,528 --> 02:16:23,040
Yeah

2397
02:16:23,296 --> 02:16:24,832
It would take an event like this

2398
02:16:25,088 --> 02:16:28,160
And and lie about it is just really dark

2399
02:16:28,416 --> 02:16:33,792
Skip ahead if you need to go to the bathroom

2400
02:16:39,168 --> 02:16:39,936
Beginning with

2401
02:16:40,192 --> 02:16:41,216
This paragraph

2402
02:16:41,472 --> 02:16:42,496

2404
02:16:48,384 --> 02:16:50,688
You don't recall if we regroup

2405
02:16:50,944 --> 02:16:52,224

2406
02:16:53,248 --> 02:16:57,344

Initially thought

2416
02:17:21,664 --> 02:17:22,432
This was closet

Terrific injuries

Other than the two dead adult females

2427
02:17:54,176 --> 02:17:56,992
Was no obvious signs of blood or tissue around the room

2428

He read this

2441
02:18:46,656 --> 02:18:47,424
When this report

2442
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:48,704
Came out in late 2000

2443
02:18:52,032 --> 02:18:54,592

Somewhere

2447
02:19:08,672 --> 02:19:09,696
Fraudulent

2448
02:19:10,464 --> 02:19:11,488
What

2449
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:17,120
Just basically framing

2450
02:19:17,632 --> 02:19:18,912
That's where more of though young

2451
02:19:19,936 --> 02:19:23,520
That's why it's normal to Tequesta

2452
02:19:24,800 --> 02:19:25,824
You're saying that

2453
02:19:26,592 --> 02:19:27,616
You you read this

2454
02:19:27,872 --> 02:19:29,408
Is it the time in question

2455
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:31,968
I don't remember I send you

2456
02:19:34,016 --> 02:19:36,064
That you read this report Bill Cario at this

2457
02:19:39,648 --> 02:19:40,672
Because you

2458
02:19:41,184 --> 02:19:41,952
Disrespect

2459
02:19:42,720 --> 02:19:43,232
Dad

2460
02:19:44,512 --> 02:19:45,280
This was

2461
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:50,400
Further evidence of there being a hoax because

2462
02:19:50,656 --> 02:19:51,680
You did not report

2463
02:19:51,936 --> 02:19:52,704
The presence of blood

2464
02:19:55,008 --> 02:19:56,032
I know I'm asking a question

2465
02:20:00,384 --> 02:20:00,896
Defied

2466
02:20:01,152 --> 02:20:03,200
Just now as you were reading

2467
02:20:03,456 --> 02:20:03,968
This

2468
02:20:04,224 --> 02:20:05,760
Isn't that weird

2469
02:20:06,528 --> 02:20:07,808
And you said that

2470
02:20:10,112 --> 02:20:12,160
You were surprised he said he was surprised

2471
02:20:13,952 --> 02:20:14,720
You're saying that

2472
02:20:14,976 --> 02:20:16,000
And what you just read

2473
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:18,304
Curio

2474
02:20:18,816 --> 02:20:20,352
So that he was surprised about what

2475
02:20:25,472 --> 02:20:26,240
Katsuya

2476
02:20:34,176 --> 02:20:34,688
He says

2477
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:36,480
I am unable to recall

2478
02:20:36,992 --> 02:20:37,504
Cific images

2479
02:20:38,272 --> 02:20:39,040
But I recall

2480
02:20:39,296 --> 02:20:40,064
The mini had

2481
02:20:40,320 --> 02:20:40,832
Injuries

2482
02:20:43,136 --> 02:20:44,416
Other than the two adult

2483
02:20:45,440 --> 02:20:46,976
Two dead adult females

2484
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:51,584
There was no obvious signs of blood or tissue around the room

2485
02:20:52,096 --> 02:20:53,120
And my first impression

2486
02:20:53,632 --> 02:20:54,144
Children

2487
02:20:54,656 --> 02:20:55,168
Elsewhere

2488
02:20:55,424 --> 02:20:56,448
And hitting in the bath

2489
02:21:01,056 --> 02:21:04,128
So he says other than where the two adult females were

2490
02:21:04,896 --> 02:21:06,432
MC button that area correct

2491
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:08,224
You know where the children were

2492
02:21:13,600 --> 02:21:15,904
And that's where you'd expect are you suggesting here in reading this

2493
02:21:16,416 --> 02:21:18,464
Are you still trying to maintain some reason

2494
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:19,488
That you think

2495
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:20,512
This

2496
02:21:20,768 --> 02:21:21,280
Report

2497
02:21:21,792 --> 02:21:23,328
Is further Evidence

2498
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:24,352
Suspicion

2499
02:21:24,608 --> 02:21:25,120
Because

2500
02:21:25,376 --> 02:21:27,936
You think that Sergeant curio didn't adequately

2501
02:21:28,192 --> 02:21:31,264
Describe the presence of blood

2502
02:21:31,776 --> 02:21:32,800
He said he was surprised

2503
02:21:33,312 --> 02:21:35,104
That's what a lot of people

2504
02:21:35,616 --> 02:21:37,408
Discuss vaguely

2505
02:21:37,664 --> 02:21:38,432
That that that

2506
02:21:38,688 --> 02:21:39,712
That's it.

2507
02:21:39,968 --> 02:21:41,760
People search

2508
02:21:43,296 --> 02:21:44,832
He said he was surprised

2509
02:21:45,088 --> 02:21:46,112
I'm sorry I'm sorry

2510
02:21:47,136 --> 02:21:47,904
Surprise or what

2511
02:21:48,928 --> 02:21:54,304
People have giant holes on a Brother killed their there's blood all over the place

2512
02:21:55,072 --> 02:21:58,656
Maybe there is the kind of stuff people cherry-pick

2513
02:21:59,424 --> 02:22:01,472
Navigate to people's houses being honest

2514
02:22:02,496 --> 02:22:05,056
Being honest when you read this

2515
02:22:05,312 --> 02:22:08,640
That Sergeant Carrillo was an EMT and

2516
02:22:10,432 --> 02:22:12,224
Was working as an EMT in the building

2517
02:22:12,736 --> 02:22:16,064
When after you claimed that there were no infusing buildings that on us

2518
02:22:16,320 --> 02:22:17,088
Objection

2519
02:22:18,112 --> 02:22:20,928
I'm just about I'm confused I was going off earlier reports

2520
02:22:25,536 --> 02:22:27,584
That no emc's weren't allowed in the building right

2521
02:22:28,352 --> 02:22:29,888
You Groove me that there were

2522
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:31,168
Correction

2523
02:22:31,424 --> 02:22:33,216
Surprised

2524
02:22:33,728 --> 02:22:34,752
Why the children

2525
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:39,360
Carrie was surprised

2526
02:22:39,872 --> 02:22:42,944
Children have been placed

2527
02:22:47,296 --> 02:22:48,064
Senator John

2528
02:22:48,832 --> 02:22:50,112
His first impression was that the

2529
02:22:50,368 --> 02:22:50,880
The children had been

2530
02:22:51,648 --> 02:22:52,160
Elsewhere

2531
02:22:52,928 --> 02:22:54,208
That would be way better

2532
02:22:55,744 --> 02:22:57,792
Is a killed elsewhere they have to replace there

2533
02:23:04,192 --> 02:23:04,704
Tire Denver

2534
02:23:05,216 --> 02:23:07,008
I want to know this is just can stay

2535
02:23:07,264 --> 02:23:08,288
I'm not tired

2536
02:23:08,544 --> 02:23:09,056
I moved

2537
02:23:10,848 --> 02:23:11,360
I mean

2538
02:23:13,152 --> 02:23:15,456
Answer questions about to get here

2539
02:23:16,224 --> 02:23:18,016
Alex is

2540
02:23:18,272 --> 02:23:19,040
Just

2541
02:23:19,296 --> 02:23:22,880
Constantly trying to find ways to rationalize his action

2542
02:23:23,904 --> 02:23:24,416
He's

2543
02:23:24,672 --> 02:23:30,816
Find he's finding something that he thinks it looks like it one of his quote-unquote anomalies in he

2544
02:23:31,072 --> 02:23:36,192
Here that he can use to be as the basis of like this is why it's reasonable for me to have

2545
02:23:36,448 --> 02:23:39,264
I've done the b******* that I've done and

2546
02:23:40,032 --> 02:23:41,568
I don't understand how somebody can

Click here

2548
02:23:43,872 --> 02:23:45,152
This description

2549
02:23:45,408 --> 02:23:51,552
Much less be reading it and that is where their brain is no I mean it did verify sounded to me

2550
02:23:51,808 --> 02:23:54,880
Like when he heard when he read there was no blood

2551
02:23:55,392 --> 02:23:55,904
He was like

2552
02:23:56,160 --> 02:23:57,952
I wish I had known that

2553
02:23:58,208 --> 02:24:02,560
Right that would have been really good for my back in the day that would have f******

2554
02:24:02,816 --> 02:24:03,328
Can killed

2555
02:24:03,584 --> 02:24:05,888
As a conspiracy about this stuff

2556
02:24:06,144 --> 02:24:08,960
If only I had done any part of my job

2557
02:24:09,472 --> 02:24:15,616
Yeah this is the this is the disgusting version of that his brain never stops trying to find his angle

2558
02:24:15,872 --> 02:24:17,152
It's it

2559
02:24:17,408 --> 02:24:19,200
It's so clear like you can

2560
02:24:19,456 --> 02:24:20,480
You can you can

2561
02:24:20,992 --> 02:24:22,016
Feel him thinking

2562
02:24:22,272 --> 02:24:27,648
Oh yeah absolutely and not just that but it is it is so much like

2563
02:24:27,904 --> 02:24:28,928
He is

2564
02:24:29,184 --> 02:24:31,488
Revealing that he didn't

2565
02:24:31,744 --> 02:24:32,512
Read this

2566
02:24:32,768 --> 02:24:33,536
Yes you know

2567
02:24:33,792 --> 02:24:35,328
And by doing this

2568
02:24:35,584 --> 02:24:36,096
I mean

2569
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:42,496
Involves reading do it of course but it is it is just like you shouldn't

2570
02:24:43,264 --> 02:24:44,288
You should read this

2571
02:24:44,544 --> 02:24:50,688
I need to rivet the Revelation that he knows well it looking into the reality of something is bad

2572
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:52,480
Business

2573
02:24:52,992 --> 02:24:54,528
It's the same thing earlier

2574
02:24:54,784 --> 02:25:00,928
I wasn't paying attention I didn't care enough to talk s***

2575
02:25:01,184 --> 02:25:06,048
Care enough to read this why is anyone holding me responsible for talkingshit

2576
02:25:06,304 --> 02:25:06,816
Right

2577
02:25:07,072 --> 02:25:13,216
So Alex has crafted this in his mind as this reason for suspicion reason for why it's

2578
02:25:13,472 --> 02:25:19,616
Justified all of his actions look there's no blood ballet by mean Immortal words

2579
02:25:19,872 --> 02:25:23,200
Doesn't jive right until you read a little bit further

2580
02:25:23,456 --> 02:25:24,480
Western 360

2581
02:25:26,016 --> 02:25:28,320
Pictures of mr. carriers report that we just been reading

2582
02:25:32,928 --> 02:25:34,720
Paragraph beginning my next Rec

My next recollect

2585
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:43,680
My next recollection

2586
02:25:44,192 --> 02:25:47,264
Is it when I return to the school I went back to roommate I believe

2587
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:48,032
Lieutenant

2588
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:56,224
Follow me and I returned what I thought was a closet but we arrived bathroom I believe there was one more gunshot

2589
02:25:58,016 --> 02:25:59,296
Splattered on the walls

2590
02:26:00,064 --> 02:26:03,904
Children actually been shot in the bathroom not in there

2591
02:26:04,416 --> 02:26:05,696
I also recognize

2592
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:07,488
Add to check

2593
02:26:08,512 --> 02:26:09,536
Possible survivors

2594
02:26:17,472 --> 02:26:18,496
What type of furniture

2595
02:26:18,752 --> 02:26:20,032
TFC kickers

2596
02:26:20,800 --> 02:26:22,592
Riding me with some software

2597
02:26:23,104 --> 02:26:25,152
Or someone from the room t f c

2598
02:26:26,176 --> 02:26:27,456
Car logo

2599
02:26:27,968 --> 02:26:30,784
420 had entered the room and was diagnosed

2600
02:26:33,344 --> 02:26:36,928
I asked if anyone had access to phone

2601
02:26:42,560 --> 02:26:43,328
Talk to you

2602
02:26:46,144 --> 02:26:48,448
Anyone have access to phone with a camera

2603
02:26:48,960 --> 02:26:49,984
I was about to

2604
02:26:51,776 --> 02:26:52,544
Crime scene

2605
02:26:53,312 --> 02:26:55,360
Call the TSC Guerra

2606
02:26:55,872 --> 02:26:56,896
Took my phone

2607
02:26:57,664 --> 02:26:58,432
There was grass

2608
02:26:58,944 --> 02:27:00,480
IPhone

2609
02:27:03,296 --> 02:27:04,576
There was some confusion

2610
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:11,488
And I did not I later learned that TSC Guerra took some photographs I started moving bodies like

2611
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:13,024
Images of

2612
02:27:13,536 --> 02:27:15,584
Thank you children the bathroom or not clear

2613
02:27:16,352 --> 02:27:19,424

I know that because

2616
02:27:23,776 --> 02:27:26,336
Began to systematically Schecter lifesigns

2617
02:27:27,104 --> 02:27:28,896
Remember calling

2618
02:27:29,152 --> 02:27:30,176
Calling into

2619
02:27:33,248 --> 02:27:34,528
Call Eula Paul

2620
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:37,344
Survivor would answer

2621
02:27:39,648 --> 02:27:41,184
Watching an open-sea movement

2622
02:27:41,952 --> 02:27:44,000
All the children out of the pot with my one

2623
02:27:44,256 --> 02:27:46,560
I did some place their bodies on the floor

2624
02:27:46,816 --> 02:27:48,352
Jobs in classroom

2625
02:27:48,864 --> 02:27:52,448
Nearest a bathroom place to children in the rolling towards entry door

2626
02:27:52,704 --> 02:27:53,728
Kenosha City memory

2627

Michelle Ramos

2628
02:28:00,640 --> 02:28:01,152
DC

2629
02:28:01,664 --> 02:28:03,456
Certain Carrillo comment on the presence of

2630
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:06,272
Blood spatter in that fortunate

2631
02:28:07,552 --> 02:28:08,064
Dumb

2632
02:28:08,832 --> 02:28:09,344
Yeah

2633
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:11,904
You have you have

2634
02:28:12,160 --> 02:28:12,928
Alex

2635
02:28:13,184 --> 02:28:16,512
Grasping at straws as he reads

2636
02:28:17,024 --> 02:28:20,608
The beginning portion of this trying to find

2637
02:28:20,864 --> 02:28:25,472
Things that he can present is anomalies not realizing that

2638
02:28:25,728 --> 02:28:27,776
A little bit later I like

2639
02:28:28,032 --> 02:28:30,848
The things that he doesn't comprehend

2640
02:28:31,104 --> 02:28:33,152
Are perfectly explained

2641
02:28:33,408 --> 02:28:34,176
A man

2642
02:28:34,688 --> 02:28:35,712
And horrifying

2643
02:28:36,224 --> 02:28:42,368
I mean he just will he'd rather make a cherry-picked anomaly out of it because

2644
02:28:43,392 --> 02:28:45,952
That's how he works well if it if he had read it

2645
02:28:46,464 --> 02:28:47,232
He would have stopped

2646
02:28:47,744 --> 02:28:53,888
When he saw when he got what he needed exactly what is

2647
02:28:54,144 --> 02:28:57,216
Beset that FBI says no one knows killed

2648
02:28:57,472 --> 02:28:58,496
I got what I wanted

2649
02:28:58,752 --> 02:28:59,520
Get out

2650
02:28:59,776 --> 02:29:04,128
OMG it's dark it's B really f****** dark

2651
02:29:04,384 --> 02:29:08,480
Even in this setting his brain can work that way

2652
02:29:08,736 --> 02:29:11,552
And that is just such a primary objective it is

2653
02:29:11,808 --> 02:29:14,624
I meant I just I mean I know it's

2654
02:29:15,136 --> 02:29:18,464
Awful and it's really hard to hear and hard to listen to

2655
02:29:18,976 --> 02:29:23,584
But there is a part of it is that this is the this is

2656
02:29:24,352 --> 02:29:26,400
In reality the event

2657
02:29:27,936 --> 02:29:29,472
That Alex lies about

2658
02:29:31,008 --> 02:29:31,520
This

2659
02:29:32,032 --> 02:29:32,800
This is

2660
02:29:33,824 --> 02:29:39,968
The image of it is Unthinkable like it that get the EMT saying it's on it's on imagine

2661
02:29:40,224 --> 02:29:40,992
Ana Belen NM

2662
02:29:43,296 --> 02:29:44,320
Instead of

2663
02:29:44,576 --> 02:29:50,720
Instead of dealing with reality Alex decided to lie and and exploit the whole time

2664
02:29:50,976 --> 02:29:57,120
He was reading that I couldn't stop thinking about Jesse Lewis and Scarlett's testimony whenever she was

2665
02:29:57,376 --> 02:29:58,912
Relating the story of him

2666
02:29:59,680 --> 02:30:01,984
Saving f****** lives you know

2667
02:30:03,264 --> 02:30:05,312
Keeping people away from this story

2668
02:30:05,568 --> 02:30:09,152
You know keeping them away from that yeah and it's just like

2669
02:30:09,408 --> 02:30:10,176
To really

2670
02:30:10,688 --> 02:30:12,224
Hear him read it

2671
02:30:13,248 --> 02:30:14,528
So blase

2672
02:30:14,784 --> 02:30:18,368
So looking for something that exculpatory that

2673
02:30:21,440 --> 02:30:21,952
Yep you know

2674
02:30:22,208 --> 02:30:28,352
Yep and it's just like it it really f**** me up

2675
02:30:28,608 --> 02:30:30,144
What is Aries like

2676
02:30:30,656 --> 02:30:35,264
Setting records of cowardice a reasonable person looks at that

2677
02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:37,312
Listen to that just goes to a billion dollars

2678
02:30:37,568 --> 02:30:40,896
You know like this guy this guy needs to be stopped

2679
02:30:41,408 --> 02:30:43,712
Yeah cuz he's not going to learn

2680
02:30:44,224 --> 02:30:49,600
It's not going to be he's not going to learn no I mean that's true and I mean I watched

2681
02:30:49,856 --> 02:30:52,160
The sanctions hearing

2682
02:30:52,416 --> 02:30:55,488
That they had nothing should leave punitive damages hearing

2683
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:57,536
That's Norm

2684
02:30:57,792 --> 02:31:01,376
And Maddie did earlier this week

2685
02:31:01,888 --> 02:31:04,448
Normal almost making your argument

2686
02:31:04,704 --> 02:31:06,496
Like a billion dollars isn't going to stop him

2687
02:31:06,752 --> 02:31:08,800
Get a trillion dollars isn't going to stop

2688
02:31:09,056 --> 02:31:15,200
He needs to be stopped what amount of money like but he was making that argument for like the fine should be lower

2689
02:31:15,456 --> 02:31:21,600
No amount of money is going to stop at this person from acting the way he does his brain

2690
02:31:21,856 --> 02:31:28,000
This is what he does he can't stop himself he cannot he's reading this

2691
02:31:28,512 --> 02:31:34,656
And he does not give a f*** you disconnected from the humanity and the reality of it that's just

2692
02:31:35,168 --> 02:31:37,984
Need the committee's disconnected from Humanity in reality

2693
02:31:38,496 --> 02:31:39,008
.

2694
02:31:39,264 --> 02:31:39,776
You know

2695
02:31:40,288 --> 02:31:42,080
Hard not to hit see it that way

2696
02:31:42,592 --> 02:31:48,480
So we have a little bit of content to your left a little bit of

2697
02:31:48,736 --> 02:31:53,088
Stuff to get through but this is the end of the the grotesque portion

2698
02:31:53,344 --> 02:31:56,928
Yeah and the deposition day wraps up

2699
02:31:57,184 --> 02:31:59,744
With a little bit of an argument about whether or not they should

2700
02:32:00,256 --> 02:32:01,024
Keep going

2701
02:32:01,280 --> 02:32:07,424
To Maddy's questions end and then the Alex's lawyer and the guy who I believe is a lawyer for

2702
02:32:08,704 --> 02:32:14,848
Genesis Communications opportunity to ask Alex

2703
02:32:15,104 --> 02:32:17,152
Day until like they need to regroup

2704
02:32:17,408 --> 02:32:22,016
Or decide to keep going and Maddie doesn't want to break

2705
02:32:22,528 --> 02:32:27,136
I am come back another day unless there's a guarantee that Alex will appear for that

2706
02:32:27,392 --> 02:32:33,536
Absolute so this becomes a little bit of an issue and Norm has a standing appointment somewhere at 6 that day

2707
02:32:33,792 --> 02:32:34,560
I am so

2708
02:32:34,816 --> 02:32:36,608
Students with that but before that

2709
02:32:37,376 --> 02:32:43,520
Maddie asks Alex shows pictures of the family members

2710
02:32:43,776 --> 02:32:44,288
Plaintiff

2711
02:32:44,544 --> 02:32:46,336
And asked Alex if he knows who they are

2712
02:32:46,592 --> 02:32:48,384
And then asked if he feels

2713
02:32:48,640 --> 02:32:53,504
Any responsibility for the pain that they've experienced because of his actions

2714
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:59,904
And Alex gets progressively more and more belligerent and hostile

2715
02:33:00,160 --> 02:33:01,440
He would have to admit you know

2716
02:33:01,952 --> 02:33:03,744
Responsibility for something

2717
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:09,376
And so this is a begins with a Alex just denying any responsibility for anything

2718
02:33:09,888 --> 02:33:10,400
You accept

2719
02:33:11,168 --> 02:33:12,448
Any responsibility

2720
02:33:12,960 --> 02:33:13,472
Jones

2721
02:33:14,240 --> 02:33:14,752
Or

2722
02:33:17,824 --> 02:33:19,104
Suffering you caused

2723
02:33:22,688 --> 02:33:23,200
Experiencing

2724
02:33:30,624 --> 02:33:34,976
No I doubt it's it's apples and oranges I didn't I didn't kill her until any children

2725
02:33:35,488 --> 02:33:36,000
And I

2726
02:33:38,048 --> 02:33:39,072
Iraq Iraq

2727
02:33:39,328 --> 02:33:41,632
Apologize to time and I am

2728
02:33:41,888 --> 02:33:43,168

2729
02:33:53,152 --> 02:33:53,664
Coronavirus

2730
02:33:55,968 --> 02:33:57,504

2731
02:33:59,552 --> 02:34:00,064
Photographs

2732
02:34:00,320 --> 02:34:00,832
No

2733
02:34:04,160 --> 02:34:07,232
You accept any responsibility for the suffering you caused

2734
02:34:09,536 --> 02:34:10,816

Concerning Sandy Hook

2738
02:34:16,448 --> 02:34:16,960
In the aftermath

2739
02:34:18,240 --> 02:34:18,752
Objection

2740

I thought it was like the wmd in Iraq thing

2743
02:34:30,272 --> 02:34:30,784
So what

2744
02:34:31,040 --> 02:34:31,552
Respect to the line

2745
02:34:32,064 --> 02:34:32,576

2751
02:34:46,144 --> 02:34:46,656
You accepting your

2752
02:34:48,192 --> 02:34:50,240
Suffering that you are

2753
02:34:52,032 --> 02:34:53,056

02:35:24,288 --> 02:35:25,056
Threatening harassment

2769
02:35:27,616 --> 02:35:30,432
Schoolboy

2770
02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:32,736
I just can't lick

2771
02:35:32,992 --> 02:35:38,368
I don't know it's hard to it's hard to listen to this all and just think like

2772
02:35:39,648 --> 02:35:42,464
How does Alex not think this has gone terribly

2773
02:35:42,720 --> 02:35:45,280
This is gone as badly as possible

2774
02:35:50,144 --> 02:35:52,192
I hate that it is it is

2775
02:35:52,448 --> 02:35:53,728
Looking at

2776
02:35:55,008 --> 02:35:56,288
How is it possible

2777
02:35:56,800 --> 02:35:57,312
You know

2778
02:35:57,824 --> 02:35:58,336
4

2779
02:35:58,848 --> 02:35:59,360
This

2780
02:35:59,616 --> 02:36:00,384
Motherfuker

2781
02:36:01,152 --> 02:36:02,688
To steamroll your life

2782
02:36:03,200 --> 02:36:03,968
You know just

2783
02:36:04,224 --> 02:36:05,248
Out of

2784
02:36:05,504 --> 02:36:06,528
He can choose

2785
02:36:06,784 --> 02:36:08,576
To steamroll your f****** life

2786
02:36:08,832 --> 02:36:09,856
If it makes him money

2787
02:36:10,368 --> 02:36:15,488
And then he'll say it was an accident and it shouldn't be a problem well I mean

2788
02:36:15,744 --> 02:36:21,120
That is great until he has to pay a billion dollars we need to get him

2789
02:36:21,632 --> 02:36:24,704
I feel I feel like

2790
02:36:24,960 --> 02:36:25,984
Optically

2791
02:36:26,496 --> 02:36:31,360
Philosophically even from Alex's own perspective none of this plays well

2792
02:36:31,616 --> 02:36:35,200
It really is a is a terrible look of a petulant baby

2793
02:36:35,456 --> 02:36:38,528
Who refuses to Greeley

2794
02:36:39,040 --> 02:36:40,064
Own up and be

2795
02:36:40,576 --> 02:36:44,160
At all an adult about how about his own actions

2796
02:36:44,672 --> 02:36:49,024
So are you gets a little hostile here towards the idea of taking responsibility

2797
02:36:50,048 --> 02:36:50,816
You recognize any of

2798
02:36:52,608 --> 02:36:53,632
Photograph

2799
02:36:55,424 --> 02:36:55,936
No

2800
02:36:58,240 --> 02:37:00,288
Accept any personal responsibility

2801
02:37:01,056 --> 02:37:02,336
The suffering you caused

2802
02:37:03,104 --> 02:37:05,664
Matthew Carly and Julian Soto

2803
02:37:06,176 --> 02:37:06,688
As a result

2804
02:37:06,944 --> 02:37:08,736
Statements you made concerning the San Diego

2805
02:37:09,504 --> 02:37:10,784
Never said her name

2806
02:37:11,296 --> 02:37:14,112
Enjoying your family I never 7X

2807
02:37:14,624 --> 02:37:15,648
Casino

2808
02:37:17,184 --> 02:37:20,512
I refuse the false guilt you're going to put on the basis for the First Amendment

2809
02:37:21,792 --> 02:37:23,072
Wow

2810
02:37:25,120 --> 02:37:28,960
He he the one thing that he doesn't understand

2811
02:37:29,472 --> 02:37:35,616
And I understand I can make sense because if you've never experienced the consequences or something

2812
02:37:36,384 --> 02:37:37,920
And you always get what you want

2813
02:37:38,432 --> 02:37:39,968
Why would you assume

2814
02:37:40,224 --> 02:37:40,736
That

2815
02:37:41,248 --> 02:37:45,344
Your deflections and your attempts to get out of stuff

2816
02:37:46,112 --> 02:37:46,880
Make you look

2817
02:37:47,136 --> 02:37:47,648
Wayward

2818
02:37:48,416 --> 02:37:53,536
Right then if you just said yes or no and you know it is you can you can tell

2819
02:37:53,792 --> 02:37:59,936
Like he's he's always gotten away with it yeah he can just wiggle out he can get you a motional and then

2820
02:38:00,192 --> 02:38:05,312
Then he gets rewarded for it in what world would he think that it's a bad mood

2821
02:38:05,824 --> 02:38:11,968
It always worked he can't recognize that in this circle

2822
02:38:12,224 --> 02:38:12,992
Stamps

2823
02:38:13,248 --> 02:38:16,064
Even from a crash

2824
02:38:16,320 --> 02:38:21,184
Cynical Alex is on personal motivations perspective even

2825
02:38:21,440 --> 02:38:24,256
For him sticking to his guns or whatever

2826
02:38:24,512 --> 02:38:27,072
Acknowledging the people's pain

2827
02:38:27,584 --> 02:38:30,656
And saying I am I am sorry for my part in that

2828
02:38:31,168 --> 02:38:34,496
It doesn't hurt him at all. Then it only helps

2829
02:38:34,752 --> 02:38:35,264
8

2830
02:38:35,776 --> 02:38:36,544
What I mean

2831
02:38:36,800 --> 02:38:39,104
Very literally if it in this

2832
02:38:39,616 --> 02:38:40,640
Deposition

2833
02:38:41,152 --> 02:38:47,040
Heated actually expressed remorse and responsibilities they could sublet maybe it would have been five

2834
02:38:47,296 --> 02:38:47,808
100 million-dollar

2835
02:38:48,576 --> 02:38:51,904
I mean who knows but I may well see here's the thing

2836
02:38:52,160 --> 02:38:53,952
For him to do that

2837
02:38:54,208 --> 02:39:00,352
He would need to have a completely different mindset and having a completely different mindset might have made it five hundred million dollars

2838
02:39:00,864 --> 02:39:05,728
This solak probably wouldn't make that big of a difference would it be indicative of a

2839
02:39:05,984 --> 02:39:07,264
Whole different paradox

2840
02:39:07,776 --> 02:39:10,592
Fort Myers Club here and it's

2841
02:39:10,848 --> 02:39:14,688
He showed a picture of Robbie Parker and he does recognize him

2842
02:39:14,944 --> 02:39:16,480
So that's a little bit of a twist

2843
02:39:17,248 --> 02:39:18,272
Recognize anybody

2844
02:39:18,784 --> 02:39:20,064
What exhibit

2845
02:39:21,856 --> 02:39:22,880
Recognize anybody

2846
02:39:23,392 --> 02:39:23,904
Make it in this photograph

2847
02:39:24,416 --> 02:39:25,952
Yes.i'd Robbie Parker and his daughter

2848
02:39:28,512 --> 02:39:29,024
Do you accept

2849
02:39:29,792 --> 02:39:30,304
Any

2850
02:39:31,584 --> 02:39:32,352
First Response

2851
02:39:32,608 --> 02:39:33,632
Story for the suffering

2852
02:39:34,400 --> 02:39:36,192
Upaws Robbie Parker as a result

2853
02:39:36,704 --> 02:39:37,472
Statements you made

2854
02:39:37,984 --> 02:39:38,752
The aftermath

2855
02:39:39,008 --> 02:39:39,776
Sandy Hook shooting

2856
02:39:42,336 --> 02:39:46,688
I did not personally made him any harm but I am sad for his loss in his painting

2857
02:39:46,944 --> 02:39:47,968
And I'm sorry if

2858
02:39:48,480 --> 02:39:52,832
You're a badass questions in this country would get them hurt him but they cannot kill his daughter

2859
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:54,112
And

2860
02:39:54,624 --> 02:39:56,416
That's why I cannot accept it

2861
02:39:56,928 --> 02:40:00,768
Possibility that you guys are created while you're out there giggling and laughing celebrating

2862
02:40:01,024 --> 02:40:02,816
In the hallway about all the attention you're getting

2863
02:40:03,072 --> 02:40:04,864
Are you coming here and talk also often

2864
02:40:07,424 --> 02:40:09,984
We manipulate people that have hearts and souls out there

2865
02:40:10,496 --> 02:40:12,288
Cold-blooded political apparatus

2866
02:40:13,568 --> 02:40:14,336
Buy into the

2867
02:40:14,592 --> 02:40:15,104
Fraud

2868
02:40:16,896 --> 02:40:17,408
Do you

2869
02:40:25,344 --> 02:40:27,648
Agree

2870
02:40:27,904 --> 02:40:29,184
That your condo

2871
02:40:29,952 --> 02:40:30,720
The aftermath

2872
02:40:34,816 --> 02:40:37,888
No I didn't even break the story or pointed out at first I didn't cover it

2873
02:40:38,400 --> 02:40:44,544
So it's just a just a refusal of of anything even in line with things that he said

2874
02:40:44,800 --> 02:40:48,384
He said earlier is this very episode that we are recording

2875
02:40:48,640 --> 02:40:52,224
I'm sorry for any pain that was caused to Robbie Parker

2876
02:40:52,480 --> 02:40:54,784
He's a good man do you know like this

2877
02:40:55,296 --> 02:40:58,880
This is just Alex recognizing the gravity of the moment

2878
02:40:59,136 --> 02:41:02,464
The Varian at this point of the end of the line of questioning

2879
02:41:02,720 --> 02:41:06,048
And him sort of feeling like he's got to be a defiant

2880
02:41:06,560 --> 02:41:08,864
Colonel Travis

2881
02:41:09,120 --> 02:41:09,888
Bandits

2882
02:41:10,144 --> 02:41:12,192
It's misguided it's disrespectful

2883
02:41:12,704 --> 02:41:13,216
It sucks

2884
02:41:13,728 --> 02:41:14,496
Ms Alex

2885
02:41:14,752 --> 02:41:15,264
Yeah

2886
02:41:15,776 --> 02:41:16,288
I mean

2887
02:41:16,544 --> 02:41:17,312
I just

2888
02:41:19,360 --> 02:41:20,128
How

2889
02:41:20,384 --> 02:41:21,920
How it's possible

2890
02:41:22,432 --> 02:41:23,200
4

2891
02:41:23,712 --> 02:41:27,808
You know so many people to have read in so many different Outlets Uno

2892
02:41:28,064 --> 02:41:32,928
Alex finally apologized for what he did or anything like that you know it's like

2893
02:41:33,952 --> 02:41:39,840
There are the only thing that an apology is is taking responsibility for your actions

2894
02:41:40,096 --> 02:41:41,632
And then working to correct that

2895
02:41:42,144 --> 02:41:45,984
That's the that's the foundation of what apology

2896
02:41:46,240 --> 02:41:52,384
Yeah should be and he fundamentally cannot do that absolutely not not a possible thing

2897
02:41:52,640 --> 02:41:54,176
Note for him to apologize

2898
02:41:54,432 --> 02:41:55,200
No because

2899
02:41:56,736 --> 02:42:02,880
All you need to really know about the penitent or lack thereof with him is when he

2900
02:42:03,136 --> 02:42:03,648
He reads

2901
02:42:04,672 --> 02:42:07,744
EMTs account of being there he's trying to find

2902
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:14,144
Rationalizations for his own actions for his own lies that you told about Sandy Hook what makes

2903
02:42:14,400 --> 02:42:16,960
What about this helps me justify myself

2904
02:42:17,472 --> 02:42:19,008
And that's

2905
02:42:19,776 --> 02:42:24,384
That's that's sucks he sucks it is

2906
02:42:25,664 --> 02:42:31,808
We don't we don't talk about him in the same way that we do serial killers

2907
02:42:32,064 --> 02:42:38,208
Of any murders that he's done since childhood in the context of

2908
02:42:38,464 --> 02:42:40,256
Like murdering somebody but it is

2909
02:42:40,768 --> 02:42:41,792
If you are

2910
02:42:42,560 --> 02:42:45,376
Read a story about a serial killer

2911
02:42:45,888 --> 02:42:47,424
They're not going to be like

2912
02:42:47,680 --> 02:42:53,824
And then he was like oh serial killing is wrong I got it now I'm really sorry about that

2913
02:42:54,080 --> 02:42:57,408
Everybody kind of gets the idea that if you're already on

2914
02:42:57,664 --> 02:42:59,456
If your on body number five

2915
02:42:59,968 --> 02:43:01,760
Reimburse is probably not for you

2916
02:43:02,016 --> 02:43:07,136
And I genuinely feel like that's where we are with Alex you know it's like

2917
02:43:07,648 --> 02:43:09,952
Where where he didn't kill anybody

2918
02:43:10,208 --> 02:43:12,256
And obviously the

2919
02:43:12,768 --> 02:43:13,280
But

2920
02:43:13,536 --> 02:43:14,048
But it is

2921
02:43:14,560 --> 02:43:15,840
He's

2922
02:43:16,096 --> 02:43:22,240
He's a serial killer what you mean there is there is not

2923
02:43:22,496 --> 02:43:28,640
Cecilia point where he's going to suddenly realize that oh no the error of my ways

2924
02:43:28,896 --> 02:43:35,040
He is probably In Too Deep for any kind of Moment of clarity like that

2925
02:43:35,296 --> 02:43:38,624
Of course that is what he needs to do to try to make a Redemption Arc

2926
02:43:38,880 --> 02:43:42,720
Only way he could be stay relevant right pull a Glenn Beck

2927
02:43:42,976 --> 02:43:49,120
Put on a sweater talk to Samantha Bee put it down for a couple of years and then get right back at it right

2928
02:43:49,376 --> 02:43:53,472
Maybe if there is a other motivation he could appear

2929
02:43:55,264 --> 02:43:57,568
In some way to have had a I had a moment

2930
02:43:57,824 --> 02:44:03,968
Even even in this same deposition episode he's lying about like

2931
02:44:04,224 --> 02:44:06,784
Breakthroughs he's hiding therapy at stuff so like

2932
02:44:07,296 --> 02:44:08,064
Dinos

2933
02:44:08,320 --> 02:44:12,672
He knows that he can he can baby use that as some kind of a

2934
02:44:13,440 --> 02:44:18,816
I'm serious card or whatever but supposed to have a when you have a breakthrough in therapy

2935
02:44:19,072 --> 02:44:23,168
Everybody's like 10 this guy's change and said it appears that he was like

2936
02:44:23,424 --> 02:44:23,936
You're right

2937
02:44:24,192 --> 02:44:27,776
I am right about everything and I should never take responsibility for my actions

2938
02:44:28,032 --> 02:44:29,824
It's good call therapist

2939
02:44:30,080 --> 02:44:35,456
So we come to the end of day 2 of Alex's depositions and we may do

2940
02:44:35,712 --> 02:44:37,248
Like another episode cleaning up

2941
02:44:37,504 --> 02:44:41,344
ID3 and for pretty minor as a whole

2942
02:44:41,856 --> 02:44:45,184
And after how this date

2943
02:44:45,440 --> 02:44:48,000
Fireworks Amor Lake

2944
02:44:48,256 --> 02:44:49,024
Yeah

2945
02:44:49,792 --> 02:44:51,840
It's too heavy app

2946
02:44:52,096 --> 02:44:57,728
And so yeah will do that and I know probably Friday will check back in to see how the

2947
02:44:58,240 --> 02:45:04,384
Stream went maybe I will see I don't know who knows I don't know at all
