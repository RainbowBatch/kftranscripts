00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,736
Knowledge party.com

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:25,344
I have great respect for knowledge B

3
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,392
Sick of them posing

4
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
Need need money

5
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,552
Knowledge fight

6
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,320
Acknowledge

7
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:05,280
The altar of Celine and talk a little bit about

8
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:10,144
Alex Jones

9
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:14,752
My brakes today Jordan is

10
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,056
So I've been lover of books

11
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,224
My life I was a Avid Reader when I was younger

12
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,624
Booze to Wonder Years

13
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,232
Choose to read when your eyes are blurry

14
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:39,840
Some of those after college Years might have been a little bit hazy around that front chair

15
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:43,424
But I always had a

16
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,192
Pretty

17
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,472
Decent collection of book

18
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:50,080
Growing up I always I like to have the bookshelf with

19
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,104
Even if

20
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:51,872
Just to look

21
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,944
Read the books but it's fun to look at

22
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,760
And I realize that I've not done that

23
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,808
I've been dead

24
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,600
The reason is because

25
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:02,880
How like

26
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:07,232
8 years ago or so nine years ago I had a house fire and my house burned down

27
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,512
And I lost

28
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,304
A giant collection of books

29
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,072
But I had

30
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:11,840
And I just

31
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,376
Kind of felt like after that point like what

32
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:16,192
What's the point of having these physical Shore

33
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,264
They can all be gone

34
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,800
Yeah and I guess

35
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:26,176
It's taken that long for me to get back on the horse because I've decided that I'm starting a new library

36
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:32,576
But it'll be a specifically anti-communist literature and Alex Jones adjacent Library

37
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,368
And I was a child

38
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:37,440
I did childish things act like but when I became a man

39
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:42,560
Right back on the horse of collecting books

40
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:46,144
And so actually today just in the mail I've got my I got my

41
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,216
First couple things that I'd ordered

42
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:52,288
Copies of the American opinion

43
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:55,104
Society magazines from the 60s

44
00:02:55,616 --> 00:03:01,760
It's antiques baby let's open it up to a random page nope too many underwear why don't you look at

45
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:06,880
Page 27

46
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:13,280
Thank you sir little Gary Allan.

47
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,816
It uses the word

48
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,608
Do you expect

49
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,264
So yeah I'm excited to put this together and also has a little bit self-serving but I wanted to put out the the message

50
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,032
Did you folks

51
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:24,800
Better

52
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:29,664
If you have any John Birch Society materials that are kicking around your house and you feel like

53
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,016
Hey I don't need this maybe Dan would like it I guarantee you I would

54
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:40,928
So if you want to contact us that would be very nice I would enjoy any contributions to the

55
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:47,328
The library of those regular old people and I know you and I have both been there you know your wandering around here

56
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:53,728
Your house in like what am I doing with all this antique communist literature from the 1940s maybe your parents have it though

57
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,776
Others others all kinds of possibilities

58
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,800
Android

59
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,848
I think it would go to a good that good home

60
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,128
I take care of it

61
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:06,528
Totally I mean it's funny that I made the joke because honestly I think our audience probably does hi mean

62
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:11,392
Audience is more likely to have this in any other worlds

63
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:17,791
Episodes

64
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:23,167
Vhs's Public Access

65
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:26,751
I think this is a little bit more likely to have somebody who's sitting on something

66
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,031
Slightly less specific

67
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,591
Think I think there's more opportunity

68
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:36,735
Is that

69
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,295
There's a certain fella named Hayao Miyazaki

70
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,831
All right now

71
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,599
He makes some

72
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,135
Pretty good movies

73
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,183
I don't know if you've ever heard of Studio Ghibli

74
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
I don't know

75
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:52,351
About that but I've heard his name before Princess Mononoke Spirited Away

76
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:58,495
Porco Rosso

77
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:03,103
Spirited Away in Princess Mononoke everywhere

78
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,151
What

79
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,431
He tweeted out

80
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,455
Or something

81
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,479
Aries picture

82
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,015
From him

83
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,063
A little statue

84
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,087
Of Grogan

85
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,879
Oh boy do you know what that mean

86
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,671
Here's what I'm thinking

87
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,255
Was this one of these Elon Musk a fake Twitter account

88
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,815
Him ogogo

89
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,583
Hellboy

90
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,119
Official Studio Ghibli

91
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:25,887
Weymouth

92
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,543
So he is going to make a Star Wars movie I thought maybe he was going to be in the man

93
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:38,943
Mandalorian next season I don't know if it's a Star Wars movie or whatever it's going to be

94
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,527
Being in

95
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:48,159
Convention a little bit would do that he's not that kind of guy but anyways

96
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:54,047
The people responsible for maybe five of my top 10 films

97
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,583
I'm making one together

98
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:00,703
Incredible I hope you're not let down

99
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,263
I will let you enjoy

100
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,335
This brightness and excitement without my sentence

101
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,151
I was only let down by Studio Ghibli one time

102
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,687
All right and that

103
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,455
Because

104
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,247
It's not just Miyazaki

105
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:17,343
You know there's another director there who's also an incredible director

106
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,743
And he's really really good but he makes less magical stuff and more grounded and realism stuff

107
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,023
And we just stopped

108
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,559
Studio Ghibli was the same

109
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,863
When I was 19 my friends and I all got

110
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
Together

111
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:34,495
Get some pizza and we wanted to watch Grave of the fireflies Studio Ghibli movies

112
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:39,359
That movie is about two children following the firebombing of Tokyo

113
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,639
Adidas

114
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:46,015
The saddest f****** anyone had ever watch and I got shot

115
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,319
How about this

116
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,855
What Studio Ghibli

117
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,415
Man we got to do that

118
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:57,535
Episode to go over and is coming out a little bit late

119
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,327
We were guarding this on Friday morning

120
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,143
And one of the reasons for that everybody thought it

121
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,911
It's the

122
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:07,775
Additional half a billion dollars Alex has to pay and punitive damages self

123
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,871
Stop

124
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,639
It's not that

125
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,175
Although

126
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,711
Fun off the lights

127
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,479
One point

128
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:21,343
5 billion almost at this point I mean if I'm if I'm the judge

129
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:27,999
You know I am writing that number out I'm writing the Fire or the four and then the other phone

130
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:32,351
For and then I'm thinking of that time that Alex put a picture of me with flames in my eyes

131
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,375
And then I'm writing

132
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,679
6010

133
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,239
Yeah it's it's quite an amount

134
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:44,639
I am interested to see where this goes but that is not why we needed to delay things because today we're covering Alex's

135
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:48,223
Star-studded midterm Alfred know it was not star-studded

136
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,295
All the stars were there

137
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,623
I'm waiting for him to get Chris Pratt I feel like we're not far away.

138
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:01,023
Today is the day

139
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,887
How did this get made

140
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,679
No today it's a bunch

141
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,471
Bunch of dorks complaining about them

142
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,847
Will enjoy that and watch that go down

143
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,151
But man it yeah it's a

144
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,431
Who

00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,503
It was long but we're only at soccer

146
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:27,391
About the beginning of the covering and then the time that Alex is there cuz Alex checks out goes home

That's what Adam he is not better tomorrow Alex is not better he sucks

183
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:01,759
He's not great yeah you know I really figured this was the time for him to step up if he was going to

184
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,527
The mint

185
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,295
Midterm

186
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:07,135
Marathon

187
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,951
Alex 4 months has been saying is going to be a false flag

188
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:16,351
Before the midterm

189
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:20,959
Midterm coverage and I mean we're now on the other side of it so we know that it was not

190
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,239
Very eventful even

191
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,031
No as a midterm

192
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:30,431
There's obviously Democrats over performed or the GOP underperformed however you want

193
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:33,759
Want to look at it maybe both maybe combination of both

194
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,295
Which leads to

195
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:38,111
A smaller GOP Victory than would have been

196
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,927
Expected in a midterm election such as this where

197
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:41,951
The Democrats

198
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,743
Goodwin the previous general election

199
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:50,399
And that's not very exciting no I mean it did feel like the American electorate

200
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,679
Sounding

201
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,983
Keep doing the exact same thing

202
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,007
Yeah it's

203
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,543
It was a

204
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,639
Knock things not great maybe we're not super

205
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:04,991
Satisfied with the way the Democratic party is operating but also not

206
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,295
Pissed off enough

207
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:13,183
The gop's going to gain ground yeah I think what it really shows his everybody's mad at both parties

208
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,719
Nobody wants

209
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:20,351
Anyone doing any more presents the population generally as a whole is more mad at Trump

210
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:25,983
That world is a positive sign

211
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,775
When you get there at least you got

212
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:32,383
It's a positive sign that you're not needed see like an overwhelming

213
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,407
Cascade of like

214
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,687
All of these

215
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,247
Like Fringe as candidate

216
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:42,111
Rising into positions of Marjorie Taylor Greene did win

217
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:48,767
I know that we talked a little bit about the possibility that she could have a competitive race check look like there wasn't

218
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,607
Possibilities both in the primary and in the general but you know

219
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,399
I thought I didn't come to pass

220
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,215
Democrat underperformed it was a giant

221
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,263
Pro Republic

222
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,031
Can District

223
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,079
It's not the biggest surprise in the world

224
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,615
Certainly unfortunate

225
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
But

226
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,223
I do like that our future Speaker of the House can only really Screech

227
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:08,991
More than

228
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,111
I don't think she's going to be this week

229
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,159
What are the Dynamics

230
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,463
That goes sort of unexplored on

231
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:23,839
On Infowars is that the lesser the margin of

232
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,631
Like

233
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,655
I ate like

234
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,679
Power

235
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:31,263
Univivi fewer people they have above 50%

236
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,079
The greater the power of people like Margie

237
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,615
Become

238
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:39,711
And that's because there's ignored entirely and Infowars analysis

239
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,039
Maybe they do maybe they don't certainly it's not

240
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:47,391
Rodger Stone has been very clear about

241
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,951
He said in the past like you don't want a

242
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,743
Giant Republican

243
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,559
You want a small win

244
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,631
And specifically the people that we know are crazy

245
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,167
We wanted them to win

246
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:03,775
Cuz then they'll hold greater amounts power but that message seems to have not gotten through

247
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:09,919
Do like Alex and Owen the best example of this maybe history is the Democrats

248
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,967
We're very very excited

249
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,247
The two have won the Senate

250
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,807
And then immediately they discovered that

251
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,367
They did not do anything even sort of close to that be

252
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,415
Because Joe manchin has more power than

253
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,207
Anyone in America

254
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,511
Dynamic is

255
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,279
Real

256
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,655
That's the fact that Alex has had to like

257
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:35,775
Do this show after screaming for months about like a false flag that never came

258
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,567
Is unfortunate

259
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,871
And then the second thing is this boring

260
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,895
Boring

261
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,431
It was a boring night

262
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:46,527
But what you'd expect at least be interesting on Infowars they wouldn't you would expect them to

263
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:52,927
To try

264
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:59,327
Acme in Harrison

265
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,351
In the info desk

266
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:03,167
Or whatever second Studio where they

267
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:07,519
Alex will throw it to Owen but I got talk about this County

268
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,591
If they have a map it should only be of the Confederate

269
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:15,455
Say it like that's what they're map should be like hey guess what Jefferson Davis is now though

270
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,503
Haha or a map of like

271
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,135
Hyrule

272
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:29,791
Over here in Tonto Village what they could have it it's like a five-person you know you have the five line

273
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:35,935
Mine's right and you have the little velcro faces that you attached to that and then we've got like

274
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,471
Soros weave

275
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,007
We've got

276
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:42,591
All those people in it like a horse race to see who's winning the most you know

277
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,639
I looks like Soros might have come out on top

278
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,199
I don't know who did but it is it's not us

279
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,735
Because here we go

280
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,807
Contacts dropped from Today Show

281
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:52,831
Ali you just

282
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,599
Mermaid swimming

283
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,719
The smart guy

284
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,279
I would say that olly Alexander is

285
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,583
Maybe the star

286
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,143
Cool

287
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,471
January 6th

288
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:16,383
He says it like this the first time in 15 years that he hasn't been involved in like campaign

289
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,431
Probably cuz of January 6th

290
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,455
But

291
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,735
I think that that

292
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,503
Is

293
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,039
Part of a desperation

294
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,063
That he has

295
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,855
I am so he's there the whole time

296
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:31,231
Oh no he's just lazy anchoring this this relay race

297
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:37,887
And Whispering I've got nowhere else to go underneath every

298
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:44,287
Not interested Charlie Kirk doesn't want me to lose

299
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:47,615
Not so the other right-wing f**** who are having the streams

300
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,687
This is about as good as it gets for Alexander at this point

301
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,271
So we start off and Alex is not there

302
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,063
Owen and Harrison

303
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,367
Are hosting the beginning of this cover it

304
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,279
We're back

305
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,047
Here

306
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
Infowars live

307
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,631
22 midterm

308
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,911
Election Harrison

309
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:14,239
Smith joins me in studio now at Harrison

310
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,775
I just had a little bit of

311
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,543
The belly laugh

312
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,335
Snooze

313
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:24,223
I should have waited for erda 212 no it is time now is the time. You haven't heard this get ready for a good laugh

314
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,015
Exact

315
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:30,367
Tweet

316
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:36,511
Are not broadcasting on his all-important election-night because unfortunately power is down in Los Angeles

317
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,047
How will we

318
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:38,815
Fill our cups

319
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,095
With their liberal tears

320
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:45,471
I don't know I it's it's a shame really I think

321
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:49,055
Everyone's being denied Irving Park

322
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:54,431
They're so excited for the liberal tears that are going to get to drink and now they've been deprived them

323
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,455
Because Young Turks

324
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,759
Not on air I do love

325
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:03,135
That American politics is absolutely completely devoid of any and all governments

326
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,159
And it's just like

327
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:04,927
Man

328
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,743
This election is going to be great cuz it'll make people feel bad

329
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,839
I want her to death so this is weird

330
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:16,447
Everything about Alex's world-building and Ameritas he's been selling for months

331
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:22,847
A power outage in the second largest city on in the US on Election night would probably be cause we're like this is a fall

332
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:29,247
Volkswagen accusation I'm willing to bet if it happened in an area that wasn't heavily blue at these Ding Dongs knew that

333
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,783
They had no chance of winning

334
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:36,415
This would be reported as proof of election fraud instead of some light-hearted news they're touching on to mock The Young Turks

335
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:42,559
They're reporting on a tweet The Young Turks posted that said quote slight delay with the start of Young Turks tonight

336
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:46,399
We'll create out here wants to show his live were experiencing a power outage but

337
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:50,495
The team is on it so we can deliver you the progressive perspective on midterms 2020

338
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,263
2

339
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,823
This was at 5:19 p.m. central

340
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,127
They plan to go live at

341
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:59,455
5 and they were up in broadcasting by around 6

342
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:03,551
Stuff happens as the crew of Infowars can clearly attack

343
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:08,671
And also by the way this is what we just listened to from Harrison is after set

344
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:15,327
So oh my God poor probably already live broad power outage in LA

345
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:19,423
Play that night is probably really local to their Studio maybe even just their build

346
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:24,799
It might have been some other Tech issue that they were calling a power outages shorthand to who knows

347
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:28,127
Anyway they did do their show there weren't a ton of liberal tears

348
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,175
40in and Harrison to mock but

349
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:36,575
Matt gaetz did show up to a painful interview where he tried to minimize his sexual assault allegations by saying that more

350
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:40,159
People that accused of biting than him which is a good.

351
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:40,927
No

352
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,695
How

353
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,975
That's a human response

354
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,255
Right from a human being

355
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:50,143
Murdered less people than that guy but I'm not really a murderer

356
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:50,911
Cool

357
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:57,567
So you see here this Glee that Owen and Harrison are putting out because they're convinced they're about to get ahead of their favorite drug

358
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,871
Which is seeing people they don't like in pain

359
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:06,527
Hey comes out really vividly every election and I do have to make it clear this isn't just some kind of joy and seeing that you have

360
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,575
Defeated your opponent

361
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,599
Political sadism

362
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,623
That's disgusting

363
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,927
So Owen

364
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,207
Is a guy

365
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:15,999
.

366
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,279
That's true

367
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,839
But if you want to describe him he's a guy who likes

368
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,607
To be thorough

369
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,655
With his investigation

370
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:26,239
He's not the kind of person who will take other people's words for things

371
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:29,055
He goes out and does his own exit polling

372
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:32,383
I don't know I feel like we have him sitting under oath that he's a puppet

373
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:38,783
No no puppet here when is an exit poll

374
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,807
Did you vote

375
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,831
Today

376
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,111
What was your experience

377
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:47,487
45 minutes waiting in line at went pretty smoothly it. No more conservative

378
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,535
Not

379
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:59,007
Probably went after you got off this morning

380
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,823
That's because I went

381
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,615
First thing in the morning

382
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,175
And I got in within 20 minutes

383
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,759
Experience

384
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,551
2

385
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,879
Free time I figured I'll me drive around and look at all the rest up

386
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,903
The polling location

387
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:19,232
I may or may not have made it to yours I think you might be just south

388
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,536
Technically

389
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,072
The areas I went to

390
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,864
Were you would vote in my disc

391
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,144
I think you might be in a

392
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,424
District

393
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,984
I was amazed at the low voter turnout

394
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,520
I was amazed

395
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,336
With the law

396
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,616
Voter turnout

397
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,432
It seemed like lines barely out the door

398
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,992
And the only places where I saw long lines

399
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,016
Where when I got

400
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,112
Traditionally more Conservative Republican areas

401
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:51,744
It did look like lines 100 200 300 people out the door but the Democrat

402
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:56,608
The Democrats are voting Republicans are all out in full force

403
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,888
Natalia

404
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:01,216
I drove around.

405
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,520
So convinced

406
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:07,616
Bet he's right and Harrison can look at somebody and tell how they're going to vote

407
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,920
If they look Democrat

408
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:13,760
What's good for the future is whenever fascist

409
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,808
Identify People based on looks

410
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:22,976
Classify them based on what we know that Alex can see demons in people see there we can look at the

411
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:27,328
Future future historians will say that they were not demons

412
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,888
Yes

413
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:33,728
Calls before Alex shows up from Oklahoma

414
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,848
The wind goes rushing to the plant that's what we do

415
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,384
Also it's a place where election

416
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,920
And fraud is happy

417
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,456
I want to take a quick call

418
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,504
Bill in Oklahoma

419
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,296
Build your own Infowars

420
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,856
Midterm election night coverage go ahead

421
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,696
Ariston

422
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:55,744
If you are

423
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,512
Receiving this

424
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,304
Transmission

425
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,328
Assistant

426
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,656
I'm in Oklahoma

427
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,216
1:45

428
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,496
Videos today

429
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,032
My experience

430
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,384
10:30 this morning

431
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,176
And the Machine

432
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,456
Already messing up

433
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,736
And I got it

434
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,504
Video

435
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,272
Woman

436
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,064
Machine

437
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,368
I've been messing up

438
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,392
Through early

439
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,928
Boarding and everything

440
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,208
And

441
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,536
The woman

442
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,304
Talk about what

443
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,584
What year

444
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:32,864
Balaton

445
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,632
Dropbox

446
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,520
That's kind of odd female song went back

447
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,824
Bet the machine tour

448
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,592
Still messy

449
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,896
Another video

450
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,712
Call worker

451
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,504
Editing

452
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,040
The woman

453
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,600
And she's like yeah

454
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,416
Nullify Ballot or change domain

455
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,440
Baba blah

456
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,744
Oklahoma

457
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:03,584
Are you putting it out

458
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,936
Social media

459
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,216
Fox News

460
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,496
Call

461
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,056
Don't have a lot of

462
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:13,824
FTP

463
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,616
Want to look up the video

464
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,896
Buy Rumble

465
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:17,664
What county is

466
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,432
W

467
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,456
Dirt

468
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,760
Rks

469
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,528
1

470
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:28,928
Took awhile to find this guy's account cuz he doesn't articulate his letters very well right but eventually I got it and I watch the tube

471
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:33,792
Videos you posted anything other than it was a humid

472
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,072
In Oklahoma

473
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,888
Which is part of what the poll worker told him was the cause of

474
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,680
The tabulation machines being down

475
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,752
I'm not even sure if I trust her expertise on it

476
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,056
Being the reason but who knows

477
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:51,456
Just one video that 20 and then the second video is where a poor worker is explaining to him that if a ballot

478
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,480
Through the reader and there's a

479
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,248
An error

480
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:58,368
The voter cam nullify that ballot in fill out a new one but they have to sign off on that process

481
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,136
The voter has

482
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,160
Decide that

483
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:03,744
The area that's most often picked up appears to be over voting

484
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,328
Where the machine doesn't read which candidate the voter pic in a certain rate

485
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,144
The poll worker has the ability to override this

486
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,424
With the voters

487
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,192
Consent

488
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:14,752
And the Machine wouldn't count all the other vote

489
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,312
Cast but in that race no vote will be tabula

490
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,336
And again

491
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,640
This is something that the voter has to sign off

492
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:27,296
This is a video of very kind and patient lady explaining to this caller how they deal with the tech at polling place

493
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:31,392
Discredit he doesn't act like an Infowars caller is pulling play some he's very polite

494
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:37,024
But he's also secretly recording these people for the purpose of accusing them of voter fraud on a national radio show

495
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,840
So you still kind of a piece of s***

496
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:44,448
Yeah so there's that also Oklahoma is an almost comically Republican state

497
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:48,288
And all of the elections he could possibly think these folks are trying to steal worth

498
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,824
Very safe.

499
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:53,408
There wasn't a voter fraud conspiracy but if there was one

500
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,176
It would not

501
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,712
Involve Oklahoma

502
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,248
I can guarantee that

503
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,808
How many ballots did after a f****** fraud

504
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,880
Make tube how suspicious it would be if

505
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:11,072
Some big race in Oklahoma everybody from f****** Northern Central Illinois

506
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,352
To Oklahoma

507
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,632
At once

508
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,168
Yeah yeah

509
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:15,936
It's

510
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:18,240
The humidity

511
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,032
According to this poll worker

512
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,568
Which might actually be another can

513
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,176
I mean do I have to pay

514
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:26,944
Pull up

515
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,480
The humidity numbers

516
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,248
On my app

517
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,808
AccuWeather deal here

518
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:36,416
I was prepared to cover all the numbers with the voting results

519
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:39,232
Coming in I didn't know I had to pull up

520
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,536
Humidity numbers here

521
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,328
This morning

522
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,312
This morning in my town

523
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,848
Where I live that

524
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,640
Bright

525
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,432
Okay

526
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,712
Mentioned earlier that

527
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,736
Cloud seeding

528
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,344
Cloudy

529
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,880
Call Aguirre till

530
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,904
Last night

531
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:14,304
I don't know if they were cloud-seeding last night they have been doing some of that lately but it was

532
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,352
I was hoping to see the eclipse

533
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,120
Pretty much

534
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,168
Didn't see anything after a

535
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,448
After about midnight

536
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,008
Facetious but this caller is not

537
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,800
If I understand correctly

538
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:27,616
This caller believes that there are weather weapons

539
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:31,968
Sunset were deployed specifically in his area of Oklahoma

540
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,504
To raise the dew point

541
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,576
Thereby causing voting machine error

542
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,344
So

543
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:42,976
That the GOP could win everything

544
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,328
But this is the level of discourse

545
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:53,728
We're seeing here on the known about how

546
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:59,872
How damaging it is to the voting system in all of this stuff to claim that there's so much for voter fraud

547
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:02,688
We know all of this but one thing we don't take into account

548
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,712
It's just how much

549
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,760
Time they have wasted of people

550
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,040
Who have good faith

551
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,856
Like he's like I'm going to there

552
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:10,880
Politely

553
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,928
I don't think he has good faith

554
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,560
He's he has good faith in terms of investigating the thing that they've told him

555
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,632
The problem

556
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,656
Good faith

557
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:26,496
In communicating

558
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,264
Is because

559
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,032
Who's he

560
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,592
The dewpoint and then came up with a

561
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,128
Conspiracy explanation

562
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:35,968
For why the dew point was I that really is crazy

563
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,248
Define

564
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:40,320
No matter what piece of information and you end up

565
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,088
Cyclic

566
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:45,696
The person at the pool her explanation of the like the humidity causes them

567
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,232
Machines to act up a little bit

568
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,792
It makes the paper softer or whatever right

569
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:54,144
If he was investigating that you would have found the dewpoint been like that it's cute

570
00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:00,544
Then his next step would have been seeing if the machines actually are affected by humidity or if there is something there

571
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,592
There

572
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:06,688
Baseless nonsense about Chinese weather weapons making it humid

573
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,784
How would you not go immediately to that that was my fur

574
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,552
First.

575
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,136
You might have more in common with old bills and

576
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,672
Viewpoint today in Illinois

577
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,256
Sure whether weapons

578
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,608
How's that related to the election

579
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:28,704
So like I said this is an All-Star star-studded affair

580
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,496
Oh my God

581
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:35,104
Pulling out the big guns are we going to see the new judge the dude is not in play

582
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,688
We met Laura Loomer on the line with us

583
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,320
And

584
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,600
Probably around 7

585
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,136
Central hour

586
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:52,256
With other great gas Steve Bannon more will start to get the numbers in I'll be going to the big board

587
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,024
As well

588
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,792
Again folks

589
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,840
What's the numbers coming in for Warnock

590
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:58,144
Lock in the Atlanta Tri-County area

591
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:02,752
I think it's what we expected to happen there in Georgia we're going to be monitoring that close

592
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:03,776
But

593
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,312
I think it's going to be

594
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:08,896
Florida I don't think the Democrats around

595
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,712
Unfortunately they like to try to

596
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:13,248
Cheap Laura Loomer out

597
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,272
Being involved

598
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,576
In congress with all the cheating they do there

599
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,600
But I think they're going to

600
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,368
Sit this one out

601
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,160
I think they're going to let De Santa

602
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,440
Just win big on Xavier

603
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,208
Who's going to win big

604
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,000
Laura Loomer joins us now though

605
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,792
Laura what's the vibe in Florida

606
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:34,240
Who got Laura Loomer on the ground

607
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,776
When you want

608
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,080
Incisive

609
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,104
Insight

610
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:40,896
Reporting

611
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,664
From the ground

612
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,712
Pull out all the stops

613
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,248
You get yourself

614
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,552
One of the Marquee reporter

615
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,088
Somebody who has

616
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,368
Never

617
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,136
Spent money

618
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:54,464
Trying to cover the Las Vegas shooting

619
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,488
As a can

620
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,768
Conspiracy

621
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,584
What someone who has never

622
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,144
Handcuff yourself to the door of Twitter

623
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,192
Cuz she got kicked off Twitter

624
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:10,336
And forgot to handcuff yourself to the other door

625
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:12,384
As your on-the-scene reporter

626
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,432
Laura f****** Loomer Jesus

627
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,200
You know you do

628
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,224
I just got to get the loom

629
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,296
And she weaves it together the way you need it

630
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,320
Alright

631
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,880
I I I mean I get it

632
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:25,696
There aren't other options

633
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,304
There were a lot of right-wing Charlie Kirk

634
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,584
Bannon

635
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,376
Crowder

636
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,520
So they were there was a there were a lot of people who are probably already booked

637
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,288
Places

638
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:45,664
Rodger stone is supposed to be on here and I don't think he even shows up he was over with the Lyndell

639
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:50,272
Ron Frank's beat is getting more money on

640
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,368
See me the any money

641
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,136
He will take

642
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:58,976
Any money video with Laura Loomer Ally Alexander

643
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:01,280
Steve Bannon I'll legitly

644
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,584
I will see you at plays out

645
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,656
I'm at Alex not even there for the first hour cowboy

646
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,936
But he does show up

647
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:12,288
I got a little bit of low energy when he shows up

648
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:19,712
Call the same in every key Battle Ground area of the country Italy seventh day

649
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:25,344
Shutdowns and stuff Dallas

650
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:29,440
Infowars

651
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:36,864
That's what you got you doesn't demonstrate any of those things either the machines breaking down or

652
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,632
Stuffed ballot

653
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:42,496
He doesn't he just says that that's happening there aren't examples of

654
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,032
Prove any of this

655
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:47,360
It's just taken as gospel you just say it and it is Drew

656
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,152
Wild

657
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,712
For him though is that all of his Goods

658
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,480
Stuff happens

659
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,504
Before the midterm

660
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,784
It's not the actual Alexa

661
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,064
Forehead mean

662
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,856
It's not the who wins or loses

663
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,648
Is that interesting on Infowars

664
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,440
It's what they're going to do to stop it

665
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:04,000
It's the Schrodinger's midterm

666
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:10,400
It happens it's kind of a letdown the ballot boxes like we knew they were going to your argument

667
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:16,800
Already pre-loaded and like your coverage is kind of predetermined same arguments from 2020

668
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,104
Arguments from 2018

669
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,920
26 that we've been here you think they seal Alexa

670
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:22,688
Because you're a loser

671
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,712
I get it

672
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:28,576
Sewing a little bit of a little Grassroots

673
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,856
Guess what

674
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,880
So did Alex

675
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,440
Confirming each other's results

676
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,232
All right what we know is that

677
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:39,072
And I don't just go out to Paul's the numbers Nebraska

678
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,096
CC

679
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,656
I went home and

680
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:46,240
Took my wife and daughter out to dinner. Mom that a restaurant

681
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,264
By Lesnar

682
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,544
Agreed

683
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:49,824
Nothing but love

684
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:50,848
Was Mom

685
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:51,616
Like I was Elvis

686
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:52,896
Stop bragging

687
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,176
Samsung powerful guy

688
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,456
Is the Black Sea

689
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,224
The rebel

690
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,760
Nothing but love in Liberal

691
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:58,784
Austin Texas

692
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,344
Take me from

693
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:02,880
My house

694
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,648
About

695
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,208
Appointment

696
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:06,976
The office

697
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:08,768
50 minutes

698
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,304
Traffic

699
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,328
Oh and I forgot

700
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,096
Before that

701
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,400
This afternoon I went to vote

702
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,192
Student line

703
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,472
440

704
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,240
5 minutes

705
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,032
As well I've never seen line five.

706
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,848
And almost everybody I talk to

707
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,872
Was voting

708
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,152
Republican and

709
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,432
If you were loading libertarian

710
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,480
Very few are voting Democrat

711
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,272
That's a leftist

712
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,296
Austin TX

713
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,112
I mean even ABC and news and others

714
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,648
Tried to go

715
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,184
The place is like Miami there

716
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,720
60 + percent Democrat

717
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,280
Couldn't find anybody in exit polls

718
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,912
Political Bloodbath

719
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,216
This is a

720
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,752
Political realignment

721
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:53,056
At 7

722
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:58,688
Certainly Alex is Riding High on these expectations of a political Bloodbath

723
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,480
Oh that's not going to be good

724
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:06,880
I don't want to get anyone's hopes up it doesn't leave till like a freak out or anything it's just

725
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:07,648
Motivate

726
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,184
Coasting downward

727
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,256
And like Alexander is if nothing else

728
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:15,584
A self-styled political analyst

729
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,120
She knows everything about the

730
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,168
These district courts and all of this

731
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:22,752
Answer when he is on the show he's talking numbers

732
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:29,152
He's talkin aquinos candidates named simile of actual election coverage

733
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:32,480
Bores the s*** out of out course it does

734
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:35,552
Election coverage

735
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:36,832
So it's

736
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,624
Like to see this just like

737
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:43,744
This is a an attempt to be like a actual news outlet and Alex is

738
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:47,328
He might as well be asleep

739
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,352
Does does

740
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:54,752
30000 mail-in ballots were just officially counted in the exit polling suggests that almost

741
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:57,824
60% of them what Democrats how exciting with that

742
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,848
Well it's demon

743
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,408
Yeah that's where I was

744
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,432
That's where I want to be

745
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,712
Be honestly

746
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:06,016
Is it the analysis desk he's over by the Big Mac

747
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:09,088
And

748
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,368
So here is

749
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:15,744
Owens first attempt at being a big boy election Journal

750
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,768
He sucks at this

751
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,792
Let's go.

752
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,328
Pennsylvania

753
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:25,728
Determinism

754
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,616
Philadelphia County

755
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:33,664
We know what goes on in Philadelphia

756
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,200
90

757
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:37,760
90

758
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:38,528
2%

759
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,344
You never see

760
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,368
A number line

761
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:51,328
I want to elaborate

762
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,680
I'm seeing massive red waves

763
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,704
Just in the numbers were

764
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,496
Saying

765
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,056
Republican

766
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,336
Block the boat you know that's

767
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,616
Strategy in the mail in

768
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,384
What

769
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,176
What are you looking for

770
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:09,760
Just like with bolsonaro in

771
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:14,624
Brazil to correctly use they are clearly stepping it

772
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,648
And I'm going against

773
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,184
What's the poll number show up

774
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,232
What are you saying are you saying Republicans

775
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,280
Not take the house and send it tonight

776
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,632
Steal the house

777
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:26,656
Because

778
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,936
You have all these different

779
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,728
District

780
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,520
Why

781
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,056
What you were just a

782
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,080
Is date

783
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:35,872
In Philadelphia

784
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,992
So this is the kind of thing you hear when you have an idiot like onfe voting analysis test

785
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:47,648
He's a person has absolutely no interest in or knowledge about historical voting patterns so he couldn't even credibly say wow

786
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:52,000
Whether or not fetterman getting over 90% of the vote in Philadelphia county is in line

787
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,024
With past election

788
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:56,096
In reality Philadelphia County contains two

789
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,632
Congressional district

790
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,936
Pennsylvania second and third District

791
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:07,104
The second district is a Democrat + 25 district and went 72.9% to Clinton and 24

792
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,384
4.9% to Trump

793
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,664
In 2016

794
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,968
And the spread was even wider

795
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,248
For obama-romney

796
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,272
2012

797
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,136
However the Third District is Democrat + 41 District

798
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:23,488
A+ and neither Romney nor Trump even got over 10% of the vote there

799
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,608
Pennsylvania's 3rd District has won the most democratic voting district in the country in cooked

800
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:32,704
Partisan index their latest analysis they were only behind Maryland

801
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,752
Which is just outside DC

802
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:38,080
In California's 12th which includes Oakland and Berkeley

803
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:41,408
Pennsylvania third is a more strongly Democrat area

804
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,432
San Francisco

805
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,736
Chicago and pretty much all of LA and New York

806
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:47,808
Owen doesn't know these things that he doesn't know that

807
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:51,136
It seems early returns like the ones he's talking about Jimmy totally

808
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:51,904
Expect it

809
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,952
Because he's stupid and uninformed

810
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,744
You take this very normal phenomenon

811
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,024
And translates it into a

812
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:57,792
Conspiracy

813
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:02,656
Also fetterman didn't end up with that high of a share of the vote in Philadelphia County

814
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:05,728
Have the time that I Was preparing this is when was only at

815
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,520
What about 82.1%

816
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,848
Which actually represented over performance there by dr. Oz

817
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:17,760
Notice how I'm commenting on how others got more votes than one might have expected but somehow I'm not implying that that's the result of an

818
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,040
Various conspiracy

819
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,320
Crazy

820
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,368
I wish that we

821
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,392
Had this

822
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,416
On MS

823
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:25,696
Just

824
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:28,000
Just somebody who's completely uninformed

825
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,280
What everybody's

826
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,560
Everybody else is

827
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:33,888
Very aware what's going on and this person just shows up

828
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:34,912
And they're like

829
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,704
A republican is winning in Oklahoma

830
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:41,056
These Liars what's this

831
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:47,712
They split Dakota into North and South

832
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:56,672
Attitude just to get more representative something is up

833
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,464
South Dakota

834
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:02,816
Going to North Dakota or is it like it is it like the northern Irish wall

835
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:09,472
Is that what we're dealing with here so it has no idea what he's talking about as it relates to Philadelphia County

836
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:14,080
That it becomes a focal point of all of his coverage throughout the entire night

837
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,152
To facilitate that he just has to make s*** up

838
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,944
Can you talk at Philadelphia County

839
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,736
Obviously Philadelphia

840
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,528
And normally you looking

841
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,296
Weather radar

842
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,856
You're looking at about a 6

843
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,392
To 70%

844
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,160
Maybe

845
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,952
Clipping

846
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:30,720
60 probably

847
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,512
26

848
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,536
16 presidential

849
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,816
2020 presidential

850
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,632
About a 90% clip

851
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,424
In Philadelphia County

852
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,496
Pittsburgh

853
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:47,104
Owens is making s*** up like he's lying to the audience because he wants to pretend

854
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,688
He's just like the adults on the news channel actually read up on these things

855
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,272
All windows facts and Trends but they're just made up

856
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:57,088
Philadelphia County went for Biden 81 points

857
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:57,856
4%

858
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,648
The trumps 17.9

859
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:06,304
The senate race results are exactly in line with what you would expect there from past historical patterns but Owens invested in

860
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,096
Constructing a voter fraud narrative

861
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:10,656
That he's willing is willing to make sure it up

862
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:13,216
To strengthen his clients that's how desperate he is to

863
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,264
Create his false reality

864
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,800
To Overlay real real

865
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:19,104
Right there aren't even details to fudge

866
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,408
Come up this whole cloth

867
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:27,808
Yeah 60% is the most

868
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:31,136
Based on all the stuff that I have read which is not nothing

869
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,928
Stuff I think about

870
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:37,536
My mind is Alex

871
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:41,120
So that means in the intervening time. I must have Reese

872
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:41,888
Search that

873
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:42,656
Clearly

874
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:52,640
Why would I just make something up that seems absurd

875
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,431
Show

876
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,711
Ally shows up

877
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,015
Call Holly Alexander the house album

878
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:00,063
Until the wee hours

879
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:02,111
Is a great political analyst Uno

880
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:05,695
Pandora Jewelry stop running today

881
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,487
Communist

882
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,535
Giveashare

883
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,071
Yuan

884
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,095
The anomaly

885
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,119
Numbers you're saying

886
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:13,887
What year

887
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:14,911
Analysis

888
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,703
Right now it's too early to tell but

889
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,239
Holly Alexander thanks for being there

890
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:19,775
Thanks for having me out

891
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,591
Starrcast I'm really excited

892
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,359
Hiiraan

893
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:26,175
Infowars and I think they were going to be able to call Raisa

894
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:26,943
Before the rest of

895
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:33,599
All-star cast to be able to call races

896
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:39,999
Before everyone else is I don't know exactly if there before anyone else would they have a couple of things that are accurate

897
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:43,839
We believe that the Warnock

898
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,119
Herschel Walker race

899
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,655
Who's going to come down to a run

900
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,703
And I don't know if that was

901
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,983
Before other outlets

902
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,775
Speculated on that boat

903
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:54,847
He may have been before other people

904
00:42:55,103 --> 00:43:01,247
It's really funny how this election livestream includes two of the three people who made that b******* documentary where they went to Mini

905
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:04,575
Minnesota to accuse ilhan Omar being married to her brother

906
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:07,135
Laura Loomer and Allie Alexandra reunites

907
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:13,791
I'm sure Jacob Wohl would have been there if he wasn't laying low after pleading guilty to a voter intimidation election fraud scheme

908
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,327
Lately just recently

909
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,351
Sitting this one out

910
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,375
Is probably his best

911
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,703
Also fun fact

912
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:27,103
That documentary where they went to Minnesota and Tuesday. Omar being married to her brother that documentary is produced buddy website cult

913
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,639
3tees

914
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,431
Which Ali was heavily involved

915
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:39,135
Incidentally was a producer of the bulshit documentary Alex's War which is definitely just a fair down the middle slice of

916
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:41,695
Life character study about an interesting guy

917
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,743
What Greenwald said

918
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,279
What a bunch of dork

919
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,583
Anyway Owen

920
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:48,863
Rambling

922
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:52,447
And then something a little chaotic happen

923
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:53,983
And I want to know

924
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,775
Not just from Alex in Hollywood

925
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:56,543
What they think about the

926
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,311
This new breed of a

927
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,431
What do you see going on with Pennsylvania now

928
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:06,015
Mehmet Oz has a large statue

929
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,599

About 15 minutes, cash right now

931
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:15,487
With Steve Bannon his live coverage of the election

932
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:18,303
Take his feet until he introduces me to his

933
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,351
Now

934
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,143
A five-point lead and it shows you

935
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:22,911
How great

936
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:23,679
Canada

00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,447
Seiko watch

942
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:37,247
Oh yeah cut oh and also we can just not be ready to have you on Alex

943
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:40,831
Where your producers manso Steve bannon's not going to be on the show

944
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:47,231
But they're going to have Alex interviewed on bannon's show and they're just going to play that is if Ben Amazon

945
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:47,999
Yeah

946
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,023
Very different

947
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:52,607
They're not really in a rush to have Alex off

948
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,911
65% of the vote in

949
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:57,727
Member of the January 6th

00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,495
Is down

951
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,503
No rush to get to Alex

952
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:10,783
Killing time

953
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,903
Do they know that Alex is what they have to know Alex

954
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:22,303
Is waiting and broadcasting on his show actually there trying to go to him but Alex's speed is

955
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,071
Bucked up

956
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:27,423
Oh the irony irony

957
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,335
Play John Cena's Denver

958
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:36,127
Control can you guys send audio or something

959
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:42,015
No it's msnbc's problem

960
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:48,415
This is not good

961
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:54,047
How am I going to get my people in 1.5 billion dollars of debt tears

962
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:56,863
You know what am I going to do with their with their audios bad

963
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,887
I can't hear

964
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:59,423
Subway

965
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:06,591
So they try to get this worked out and the producer of band and show is audible on Alex

966
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,359
The Stream

967
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:13,759
And they're trying to get the video feed worked out yet Alex is feeding back the Bannon show feeds

968
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:18,111
And

969
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,647
Has Alex on

970
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,439
Alex Jones

971
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:24,511
Tell us what you're saying is you look at it look at here

972
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,279
Cross this

973
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,047
Battle map

974
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,839
A tickling in your beloved state of

975
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:30,143
Texas down there in the Rio Grande Valley

976
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:32,447
Bluff Texas

977
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:34,751
Absolutely I want to talk about Texas

978
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:38,335
Looks like it's going for Democrats what is tonight goes on

979
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:40,895
And we always have I gone rattly since the time

980
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:43,455
Dwight D Eisenhower back in the 19

981
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,223
Pimply butt

982
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:45,503
You said Steve

983
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:48,063
Is absolutely On Target we have the whole corporate

984
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:48,831
Media

985
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,623
Big tackle Democratic Party

986
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,647
The rhinos

987
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,183
The neocon

988
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,975
Bullying the American people

989
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:56,255
The last two years

990
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,535
Find the drivers

991
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,839
This is a referendum

992
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,119
Against the power structure

993
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,399
The ragtag

994
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:05,471
American people in red blood of a race color and Creed

995
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:06,751
Come together

996
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:08,543
Until we want America back

997
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,567
Republic

998
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,895
We don't want the leftist critical race theory of the transgenderism

999
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:14,687
The open borders in the wars

1000
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:19,039
Despite all the fraud

1001
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,087
Call

1002
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:24,415
Google manipulation all the Facebook manipulation and all

1003
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,695
Manipulation

1004
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:31,071
The pendulum is swinging back in a mighty mighty way and no matter how much fraud they throw at us

1005
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,863
They can't stop a red tsunami

1006
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:35,935
So I think we're going to see a major major victory

1007
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:36,703
Tonight

1008
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:41,055
Alex trying to make the most of his limited time the ban is going to give him until you can hear him

1009
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:46,431
Jamming everything I ever thought it was a red salami

1010
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,367
Little chorizo in there

1011
00:47:54,623 --> 00:48:00,767
Just a couple minutes and it's just like catchphrases

1012
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,047
Is man it's ridiculous

1013
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:03,327
And that's what this

1014
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:04,863
Directions about

1015
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,911
Rising to the challenge

1016
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:09,727
Just like we beat Great Britain

1017
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,519
250 years ago

1018
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:13,055
Cost of the beginning

1025
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:35,839
Take a short commercial break Ed Henry Steven K Bannon

1026
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,119
Tired

1027
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:39,423
Yep so it's just a couple minutes there

1028
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,215
Simulcast

1029
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,519
It's just Alex appearing on Panic show

1030
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:47,615
Alex

1031
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:54,271
Stream power imbalances very clear

1032
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:55,807
Stitches Alex

1033
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:59,647
Throwing up NeverEnding run-on sentences about the Public's awake and

1034
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,183
Globalstar the Run

1035
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,719
How is meeting with platitudes

1036
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:09,375
It's tough to listen to send it so clearly Alex trying to make the most of the very little time but he's being offered on a more relevant

1037
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,399
Show them his own

1038
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:13,983
Like he's hanging out with olly Alexander Laura Loomer and Owen Shroyer

1039
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,007
Like this is not

1040
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,543
It's clear

1041
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,567
Yeah I mean

1042
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:22,175
It is funny that we're dealing with tears so obviously you know like

1043
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:22,943
Alex

1044
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:25,247
This is clearly subordinate to ban in

1045
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:28,063
Ali Alexander clearly subordinate to Alex

1046
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:31,647
Harrison Smith is under the ground somewhere he went to bed

1047
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:39,071
We're supposed to be Manning the big board

1048
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:40,351
But I think that

1049
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:44,447
Because Harrison had done his show in the morning he been up since like

1050
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:48,799
For something like that but they like you can go to bed

1051
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,079
You can only do so much

1052
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:57,247
You're right

1053
00:49:57,503 --> 00:50:02,111
He doesn't show on Infowars against upwards of two thousand viewers

1054
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:04,159
Irrelevant yeah he is not exist

1055
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,695
But yeah

1056
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:09,279
And you know there's there's an interesting thing to admit like

1057
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:12,607
Tim pool has a stream what's going on

1058
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:14,399
Alex not welcome on that

1059
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:17,215
That's not even a that's not even a consideration

1060
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:19,263
Maybe you would be but he's not

1061
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,543
Is that somebody the pool

1062
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,567
Azan

1063
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,663
Steven Crowder he probably could be on that he's been on crowder show but he's not

1064
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,431
Nope

1065
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,711
It's not on there

1066
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:29,759
Banning has him on for a couple minutes

1067
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,807
Charlie Kirk

1068
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:34,367
Not a person talk about nothing

1069
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:38,207
Alex's he's where he is

1070
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:39,231
Rogan

1071
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:42,303
Not coming

1072
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:45,887
Bougie

1073
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:49,471
That's more analysis got to go back to the big board

1074
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:51,263
Big boredom analysis

1075
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,615
That is a blue Mirage

1076
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,319
The only chance

1077
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:09,183
Is going to have here

1078
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,743
Overwhelming numbers

1079
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:14,559
Talking about

1080
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:16,351
In major cities

1081
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,911
And you can see

1082
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,031
In Philadelphia

1083
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:25,567
I mean that that is

1084
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,503
Presidential election

1085
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,551
Let's just see exactly what we're dealing with here

1086
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:38,879
I do believe we're going to be okay

1087
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:45,023
To the 2020 election results

1088
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,303
To see the numbers in Philadelphia

1089
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,071
Tri-County

1090
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,351
And then as well

1091
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:50,399
2016

1092
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,935
On my side screen over here

1093
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:54,495
Right now

1094
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:58,079
So let me just going to come in

1095
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:00,639
Molly Alexander will come back to you in the Harrison Smith

1096
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:05,503
Ali for a really harsh wake-up call if he finds those numbers

1097
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:09,855
I'm not sure what Owen means when he says that fetterman is dominating in the Northeast

1098
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:14,463
In the Northwest specifically Erie County but most of the North

1099
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:18,047
Counties in the state of Pennsylvania are pretty red District

1100
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:24,703
Wayne County Susquehanna County in Pike County all-arounder over 60% of Dr.Oz

1101
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:28,031
But Federman had a good showing along the southeast of the state

1102
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:30,847
Including Philadelphia and then up the eastern border

1103
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:33,151
To Allentown in a little bit further north

1104
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,199
He did over perform

1105
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,223
In a number of

1106
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:38,271
Red counties but they all still one

1107
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,295
Pretty strongly

1108
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,319
Ethiopia

1109
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:42,623
Right I mean I understand

1110
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:44,159
Cuz of the world we existed

1111
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,719
Why it seems absurd

1112
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:50,815
For any candidate to get more than 90% of the vote right

1113
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:52,095
Crazy

1114
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:53,631
Within the context of

1115
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:54,399
Now

1116
00:52:54,911 --> 00:53:00,031
But if you were to tell me that a TV Doctor Who Lies to people for money

1117
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,055
Is

1118
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,591
Racing against a

1119
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,639
Guy who works for a living

1120
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:06,175
Ewing literally anything

1121
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:09,759
Guy who works for a living get 90%

1122
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:10,783
Over that

1123
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:15,903
Instead of saying World Herschel Walker doesn't go to a runoff

1124
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,183
He does

1125
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:20,255
How old the reasons

1126
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:24,863
Possible that there were like more Democrat votes

1127
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:31,263
Open Wayne and Pike County is early on Northeast of the state doesn't seem like that would have been like blowout number

1128
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,799
A Lego Anna saying

1129
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:35,359
I don't really know what's going on here I think you've got the North

1130
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:36,383
The northwest

1131
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,407
Next up

1132
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:38,687
Maybe that makes

1133
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:40,991
Except is there brand

1134
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,527
Is

1135
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,831
Dangerous territory trying to look up

1136
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:50,463
2020 and 2016 numbers against all of the rules that we have given them don't look

1137
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,743
For the truth come on

1138
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:58,143
If the producers had any sway they'll be like don't do it don't do it don't do it. Look at the numbers don't look at the numbers

1139
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:01,215
But unfortunately does find them

1140
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:05,567
She has what we're looking for

1141
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:06,591
In most of the areas

1142
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:08,127
Actually in Pennsylvania

1143
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:10,687
Including the counties outside of Philadelphia

1144
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:12,991
But you're not talking about

1145
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,271
Ridiculous

1146
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:15,039
In the past

1147
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:17,855
Adelphia County

1148
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:22,975
Is the 2020 election results

1149
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,303
Philadelphia

1150
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:33,983
I can't

1151
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,519
Now give me Philadelphia County

1152
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:36,799
I don't know why I

1153
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,079
I can't get the Philadelphia

1154
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:47,807
Bad audio

1155
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:48,575
The number

1156
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:53,951
Percent okay 91% right now

1157
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:56,511
Just ignore the rest of the County's

1158
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,583
1%

1159
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,631
2020

1160
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:02,911
County

1161
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:04,703
81

1162
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:09,823
If you believe those

1163
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:15,199
Popular

1164
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:20,319
It's pretty amazing what just happened they're like this is you really have to understand that

1165
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:26,719
Slam dunk Point yoga for looking into it at all he pulled up a past election

1166
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:27,999
Salt from Philadelphia County

1167
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:32,095
Totally expecting them to be 60% or so Democrat win

1168
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:38,495
Unfortunately Biden won the county with over 80% which makes the numbers that sediment is putting up not really look that weird

1169
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:43,359
I want as essentially debunked his own argument so instead of just accepting reality and that he was

1170
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:45,407
Totally wrong about everything he's been saying

1171
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:49,247
Owen says that it was an 81% Biden win in 2020 be

1172
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:51,551
Cuz there was three hundred thousand fake palette

1173
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:55,647
It really was actually like a 60% win if there is

1174
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:59,999
If there is any more perfect encapsulation perfect

1175
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:01,023
It's just what it is

1176
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:03,327
You're not going to argue out

1177
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:05,887
Yeah why even use that

1178
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:11,519
What's the point of bringing up accounts from past elections if you're just going to make up your own numbers anyway it doesn't matter

1179
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:17,919
I understand and accept that other media Outlets have a lot of fair criticism heading their way for their election coverage but this isn't a

1180
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:18,687
League

1181
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:19,967
If someone

1182
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:23,295
Provide analysis on the election made

1183
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:29,695
The fumble like Owen just did and then they had to make s*** up to try and save the ship they would not have that job much longer

1184
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:36,351
No divorce though no one even cares enough to try know it Infowars if you say there's a conspiracy and then Pro

1185
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,375
Prove yourself wrong

1186
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:39,167
Do you know what your answer to that is

1187
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:42,495
I didn't know it was an even bigger conspiracy

1188
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:47,103
Multi-year confusing it fired if you don't keep

1189
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:56,319
Election coverage version of posting your way through

1190
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:59,135
Is so funny to me about all of this is it

1191
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:05,023
Doesn't get better for like voter fraud isn't real argument then

1192
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,327
The status quo just staying

1193
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:10,655
Exactly the same after an election you know like

1194
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:11,679
Who is

1195
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:14,751
Stealing elections to stay the same

1196
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:16,031
Could not win

1197
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:22,431
You know like what kind of equilibrium of everyone's feeling so many like I connect

1198
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:23,199
Actually answered

1199
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:26,527
So to you it seems like a homeostasis

1200
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,087
Static it is

1201
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,879
And maybe that is the case

1202
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:34,719
Reason that they steal elections to keep things static is B

1203
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:35,487
Because

1204
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,535
Alex and his crew are trying to

1205
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,839
To take over the country and restore Liberty

1206
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:42,655
That would be a drastic thing that

1207
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:46,495
Is actually preferable to to the globalist

1208
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:48,287
Preferred

1209
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:50,335
To steal elections in order to just keep things

1210
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,383
Kind of going along humdrum

1211
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:54,943
As opposed to liberty rising

1212
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:56,991
Interesting

1213
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,527
Idea for them

1214
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,807
Yep it's a bad one

1215
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,343
It's not a winning strategy

1216
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,903
No no it's kind of it's it's

1217
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:06,975
Something they would probably not want to articulate

1218
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:08,511
Yeah because it's no sound

1219
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:13,631
Really because it is beneath like a lot of their Theory know sometimes when people are like

1220
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:14,655
The way we have

1221
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:15,423
To win

1222
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:16,191
Is Toulouse

1223
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:16,959
And you're like

1224
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:18,239
Maybe that's

1225
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,263
I guess the plan

1226
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,543
This time you're like

1227
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:21,823
That's a really dumb

1228
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:22,847
Sure

1229
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:29,247
So so it looks a little bit more into the numbers coming out of Philly or Pennsylvania 3rd District

1230
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:31,295
Right around there in Philadelphia County

1231
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:32,831
I need to Claire's this

1232
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:33,599
Impossible

1233
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:36,159
I'm they were stopping right now gop's out

1234
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:39,231
40 seats Democrats have

1235
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:40,255
39

1236
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,791
16 of 35 seats

1237
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:44,351
Have been called so far so still some to go but

1238
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,983
It looks like they were completely off

1239
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:52,031
And what would you

1240
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:54,335
Excited about something

1241
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,359
Get this

1242
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:57,919
Hero

1243
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:08,159
In a in a district

1244
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:16,351
White people

1245
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:17,375
Explain what you just

1246
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:18,143
I'm talking about

1247
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:21,983
County

1248
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,263
This is where the Democrat

1249
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:27,103
In the morning

1250
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:29,663
On the 2020 election night we all went

1251
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:30,687
Why

1252
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:34,015
Normally win by 6

1253
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:34,783
In those

1254
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:36,319
Directions

1255
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:37,855
The Democrats.

1256
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:39,135
600000

1257
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,183
And I believe

1258
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:46,559
1584

1259
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:49,887
Spider-Man

1260
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:50,911
And

1261
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,703
Shapiro

1262
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:53,727
Intense

1263
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:55,263
Sylvania

1264
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:58,591
Even though

1265
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:00,127
A 90%

1266
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:02,175
County

1267
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:03,967
Is Ludacris

1268
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,759
It's absurd

1269
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:07,039
It's an impossible

1270
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:08,575
Listen up

1271
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:09,855
It's impossible

1272
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:12,415
I don't understand

1273
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:14,207
If his own

1274
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:18,303
Is a normally Wendy's by 60 to 70%

1275
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:20,095
Wipeout itself

1276
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:24,703
Well because the Maga Republicans are to power

1277
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:29,055
They're going to overcome that sixty-two 70% clip

1278
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:34,687
Everyone likes to say until they have to they have to stuff the ballot in order to keep that

1279
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:37,759
70% but if that were the case

1280
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:40,063
Then they would have won by 60 to 70%

1281
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:41,599
Maybe they overdid it

1282
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:44,671
Beersy

1283
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:46,463
Whoops guys we accidentally

1284
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:50,303
Book stuff too many valves all stuff balance

1285
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,863
Look up the mules were drunk

1286
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:55,423
Play a little crazy

1287
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,447
A big problem have

1288
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:59,007
The North Korean boat

1289
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,287
Finally got there

1290
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:04,383
Maybe that's why Rodger wasn't on investigating a boat

1291
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:06,687
So Alex's mother Gaston

1292
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:09,503
I'm telling you a big gun

1293
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:12,575
Hernandez in while you doing analysis

1294
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:17,183
Your house in the next 5-10 minutes I'm going to rub you I want you to be able to lay out

1295
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,975
What you're saying what you think's going on

1296
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:20,767
Open Arizona

1297
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:24,607
Arizona

1298
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:27,167
Something we need to pay attention to

1299
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:28,191
We still.

1300
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:29,471
For all that

1301
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,239
Patient begins

1302
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,007
A mountain

1303
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,543
All day

1304
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:33,567
Arizona

1305
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:34,847
Isn't embarrassed

1306
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:41,503
We got Drew Hernandez the baby reporter

1307
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:43,807
5 to 10 minutes

1308
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:50,207
So at the time of my preparing this episode

1309
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:51,231
Cinderseal votes

1310
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:55,839
But there's only 71% about scouted so there could be some motion there

1311
01:01:56,351 --> 01:02:02,495
Three of the house seats are safely one by the GOP into by democrats with four that were still up to be called

1312
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:07,103
Kari Lake a real dumb dumb is currently losing to Democrat Katie Hobbs

1313
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:11,199
Who's in the governor's race which also is only a little over 70% of the ballots in

1314
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:17,855
I think the baby reporter Drew Hernandez here is correct they should keep their eyes on Arizona and then claim all of them

1315
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:19,903
Results are fake when they don't like what they see

1316
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,695
Games being played here

1317
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:24,767
Man it is all you got to do

1318
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:29,631
All you got to do is be on TV for a while and then somebody's like yeah you could be in Congress

1319
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:31,679
That's so it

1320
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:33,215
That's all you need

1321
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:42,687
You got to get on TV don't know I just don't know man I just don't know

1322
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:43,967
So Alex is going to predict

1323
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:46,783
Robots

1324
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:47,807
Volkswagen

1325
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:49,343
Surprise

1326
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:51,135
Others red wine. Let's go back

1327
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:51,903
False flag

1328
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:54,207
They wouldn't have VIP are they wouldn't have the insurance

1329
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:55,743
MSN

1330
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:58,815
BC Crowell they wouldn't have seen anyone that make that

1331
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:00,607
Tanger Republicans are violin

1332
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,655
They're going to shoot and kill them both Step Up

1333
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,679
When they lose

1334
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:05,983
They wouldn't have sold that whole narrative

1335
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:07,007
They weren't planning

1336
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:08,799
The pre-programming in

1337
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:10,847
I'll talk to Mike Adams about that the moment

1338
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:12,895
Hernandez your take on that

1339
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:16,735
It's either they will go forward

1340
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:17,759
Something like that

1341
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:19,039
Or they just leave it as a

1342
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:20,831
Play a10e

1343
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:25,695
They want ohyeah okay so maybe false flags are coming or maybe they're not but they could

1344
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:31,327
It's the classic 50/50 chance would happen or it could not

1345
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:32,863
Genius stop

1346
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:33,631
Totally

1347
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:34,911
Also like Adam

1348
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:40,543
I'm coming up oh no what a f****** all-star cast

1349
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:45,919
Can escape any one of these days everybody is there it's like Smash Brothers

1350
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:50,527
It is the crossover event of the century

1351
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:51,295
And Alex

1352
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:52,063
Forgot wallet

1353
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:54,623
I'm telling you right now you have no idea

1354
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:55,647
Up next

1355
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:56,415
Ash catcher

1356
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,439
Well yeah

1357
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:00,767
He's finally going to predict them

1358
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:06,399
My next guest that big ham

1359
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:09,471
I didn't play a lot of Smash Brothers I don't know any other names

1360
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:13,055
Captain Falcon is joining us from Florida

1361
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:13,823
That's a good one

1362
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,383
You got it all right

1363
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,663
The Ice Climbers

1364
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:20,223
Climber's that was later on

1365
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:23,039
Box

1366
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:24,575
Starbucks

1367
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:26,111
Kirby just walks

1368
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:29,439
Kirby's another one

1369
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,719
I don't know I don't think so

1370
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:31,487
Kirby

1371
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:32,767
Kirbyville

1372
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:34,303
Circle yes

1373
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:37,631
Oh yeah that's right

1374
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:44,287
Oh wow I forgot about it one of the first off I remember the formica super early out of the the 64

1375
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:46,079
Cuz you could never get rid of him cuz he could

1376
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:47,871
Float no that was Jigglypuff

1377
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:48,895
They're both in it

1378
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:51,711
Now got a roll there I don't know anything anymore

1379
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:56,063
I don't know anything anymore

1380
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,647
I I want to we're going back to

1381
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:04,511
The coverage here but I just remembered something that I meant to say the top of the show and

1382
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:08,351
Big bears mentioning that is our last episode about Alex's deposition

1383
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:11,935
Made fun of a little bit they doodling and

1384
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:14,751
It's been brought to my attention the folks who have ADD

1385
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:15,775
Search stay

1386
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:17,567
Sometimes it doesn't help them Focus

1387
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:20,127
Doodle and I did not mean to beep

1388
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:23,455
Pejorative or make fun of folks who are who are in that

1389
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:29,855
I mean to me but that's the case with Alex

1390
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:31,903
That in a deposition and I like when I'm talking

1391
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:33,695
To my with my wife

1392
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:40,095
She's already she's drawing all the time and it helps our focus and she has ADHD

1393
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:42,655
You did not mean to malign anybody

1394
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:46,239
The case for that I just also don't think that's the case for Alex

1395
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:51,615
And other childish behaviors that key and bodies also sort of factor into the way I was

1396
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:55,455
Describing that anybody took that

1397
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:58,015
And way that I did not intend that we were not denigrating

1398
01:05:58,783 --> 01:06:02,111
So now you're back to someone I do want to denigrate and I've known for

1399
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,391
You want to tell people

1400
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:04,927
She's about to go bad with love

1401
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:06,207
And they're going to get crazy

1402
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,231
Sure

1403
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:09,279
You just got to keep your your steady

1404
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:12,607
What the establishment and the American left

1405
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:15,167
Is about to go through in this psychotic break

1406
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:16,959
Is going to be in

1407
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:27,455
Message would just be

1408
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:30,015
When the American Life Starts have psychic

1409
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:33,087
Across this country

1410
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:34,111
And you stabbed

1411
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,183
It can be very

1412
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:40,255
And we maintain our steady

1413
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:44,863
That balance

1414
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,911
Because we are winning we are taking

1415
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:48,191
The country in the planet back

1416
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:51,519
Right now

1417
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:52,287
Huge

1418
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:55,103
Herschel Walker is now

1419
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:57,151
Great news

1420
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:58,943
Eoin

1421
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:00,223
You know

1422
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:01,503
I personally

1423
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:05,087
Don't think that's running with the ball is

1424
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:06,111
Government material

1425
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:12,511
And in fact I would say this 20K in the in the 60s or whatever it was I don't remember

1426
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:14,559
Isaac Newton was in Portland

1427
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:17,119
Elected Isaac Newton to Parliament you know why

1428
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:19,423
He's a famous genius

1429
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:23,263
He was not a good legislator their skills

1430
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:28,895
People who like play sports even professionally don't have

1431
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:29,919
Potential leadership

1432
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:31,967
Possibilities capabilities

1433
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:34,783
It is it is entirely possible it doesn't

1434
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:35,807
Is maybe not

1435
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:38,367
Miracle part of the resume

1436
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:40,927
But also Herschel Walker sucks

1437
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,975
So any number of reasons

1438
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:47,583
Yeah whether or not he was a football player

1439
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:49,375
Anyway Mike Adams

1440
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:50,143
Our guy

1441
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:50,911
Is on

1442
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,703
And he has a very ironic

1443
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:53,471
Thing to say

1444
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:54,751
If

1445
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:58,079
Party were made up of rational reasonable

1446
01:07:58,591 --> 01:07:59,359
Humanity driven

1447
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,151
And they were too

1448
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:04,223
Suffering tonight

1449
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,039
Engage in introspection

1450
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:12,159
What's wrong with her message

1451
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:18,559
That will not happen

1452
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:19,327
Because there's

1453
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,095
Sociopath

1454
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:21,631
They love

1455
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:23,167
To control you they love

1456
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:24,703
To rule over

1457
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:26,751
We are tyrants

1458
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:28,287
They are child mutilators

1459
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:29,055
Bears

1460
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:33,151
You dumb f*** storm the capital don't know what else to say

1461
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:34,175
Beyond

1462
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:39,039
Talk for the last 2 years about the election being stolen

1463
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:40,063
Andrew storm

1464
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:40,831
The capital

1465
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:46,975
And not just that but if you want to if you're sore losers these Democrat

1466
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:49,535
Then what you were talking about was what happened

1467
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:51,839
In 2008 after Obama won by such

1468
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:58,239
Huge margin of Victory everyone on the Republic at all GOP operas or like we need to have a

1469
01:08:58,495 --> 01:09:00,287
Analysis of the selection of

1470
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:05,151
Totally the whole thing and instead of being like we need to appeal to more people

1471
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:06,943
They were like we should get more races

1472
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:09,759
Best got Betty party shade is going to be really helpful

1473
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:11,807
The sociopathic response

1474
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:12,831
Right right

1475
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:14,879
Yeah I just love

1476
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:16,415
The idea that

1477
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:18,207
When you lose an election

1478
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:22,559
It is time to assess like we did in 2020 I mean just insane

1479
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:23,583
Call Mike

1480
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:26,655
So anyway there's another Mike that has been Vindicated

1481
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:28,959
It is not Michael Jordan

1482
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:30,495
Is that Michael B

1483
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:31,519
Be Jordan

1484
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:32,543
Is Mike Lindell

1485
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:35,103
But you know if anybody tonight

1486
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:36,127
It's Mike Mendel

1487
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,151
Because

1488
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:42,271
Voting machine coin

1489
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:43,551
Because we've seen

1490
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:46,111
Mail-in ballots and all that

1491
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:49,439
Double back on the machines and sucker punches

1492
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:54,047
Michael David indicated B

1493
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:56,607
Because the machines get even if they're not

1494
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:59,167
Maliciously programmed in any way whatsoever

1495
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:00,447
Just the fact that they can be

1496
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:03,263
There can be problems

1497
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:04,031
Problems

1498
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:07,103
So Michael and Bell is Vindicated because sometimes mushy

1499
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:07,871
Beams don't work

1500
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:14,527
I didn't listen to round with pillow

1501
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:18,879
But maybe he's been Vindicated I don't know maybe it was a good pillows I've never I've never

1502
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:23,999
Yeah I don't see how it could possibly be worthwhile Aztec not my pillow

1503
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:25,279
I don't know if

1504
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:28,351
A pillow could be comfortable enough

1505
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:30,399
For me to look past

1506
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:31,679
All of the other thing

1507
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:33,727
Thanks I don't know if that's a possible

1508
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:37,567
Yeah well I mean your sleep half your life

1509
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:38,591
That's true

1510
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:42,943
Maybe it's that important so Alex

1511
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:44,735
Has the Beast Gaston

1512
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:46,527
Hey does a crew of loser

1513
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:48,063
But he looks at it

1514
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:49,087
Corset

1515
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:51,391
Alex

1516
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:53,439
Alright I'm going to give

1517
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:55,487
Are the smartest people I know these are all

1518
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:59,327
Already had Mike Adams

1519
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:01,631
Already add bananas on already had

1520
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:03,167
Rodger Stone coming up

1521
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:05,983
Comeback

1522
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:10,591
Come back with Robert Barnes

1523
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:11,615
Constitutional lawyer

1524
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:12,639
I got a lawyer

1525
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:14,175
Historian good friend of mine

1526
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:16,735
All the smartest people Alex knows are idiots

1527
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:18,271
I I mean

1528
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:19,551
Wow

1529
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:20,319
Damn

1530
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:22,879
Barnes comes on

1531
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:26,207
And he's a little Alex's dramatic

1532
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:27,231
Coming back from break

1533
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:29,279
I got to say Barnes

1534
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:32,095
Pretty boring but reasonable take

1535
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:33,119
Okay on the elect

1536
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:40,543
The song it's great that's is boring

1537
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:44,639
I expected

1538
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:51,295
Exactly where I want to be in this fight

1539
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:55,135
And I'm so proud of

1540
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:57,183
Who are they

1541
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,327
Bikers are proud of you

1542
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:04,863
But you're informed involved

1543
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:11,775
What historic day

1544
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,567
A urinalysis

1545
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:14,847
The way it is

1546
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:17,151
The outages the bizarre behavior

1547
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:18,943
What's happening you got the floor

1548
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:22,527
I think our Republicans still have an excellent

1549
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:23,807
Chance to take

1550
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:24,575
The house tonight

1551
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:26,623
Also take the Senate tonight

1552
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:28,159
Also take that at least

1553
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:29,183
Some governorship

1554
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:31,743
Across the country that were in Democratic hands

1555
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:32,511
Before tonight

1556
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:35,071
Pretty boring but measured

1557
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:40,191
Pretty just a Barnes coming in with

1558
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:42,751
Hey here's the answer to your question

1559
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:47,615
And I was given that whole speech over what would amount to like the supervillain

1560
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:48,639
Music

1561
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:51,455
Your ancestors are priority

1562
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:53,759
That's car speed from The Lion King

1563
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:59,391
The song We're choosing who will punish them for what they did to the hyenas

1564
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:01,695
Whoopi Goldberg

1565
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:05,279
And also if it's like

1566
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:07,327
Keep saying all this stuff about like

1567
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:12,447
These outrages and said what

1568
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:17,567
Philadelphia County

1569
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:18,847
Great

1570
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:20,127
Barnes ism

1571
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:20,895
Complaints

1572
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:22,431
I still like the chances

1573
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:24,223
Is Adam laxalt in Nevada

1574
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:24,991
I still like the chi

1575
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:27,039
Lakemaster

1576
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:28,063
Actors in Arizona

1577
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:30,367
I still think when the night is done and tomorrow

1578
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:35,231
Counting ballots I guess until Saturday or Sunday apparently loved

1579
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:35,999
M2

1580
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:37,535
Harry Reid's Nevada.

1581
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:39,327
Picture of a boating

1582
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,607
Harry Reid died last

1583
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:42,655
You're pretty sure he was dead

1584
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:45,471
I don't know what you have to do with it

1585
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:49,823
Yes I've been in Congress since like 2017

1586
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:56,735
I don't know why because of Harry Reed's involvement in like some of that

1587
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:58,015
He was a target of

1588
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:59,807
Fire during the Bundy

1589
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:02,623
Stop and so maybe it's just like

1590
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:09,023
Lip service to talk about Nevada.

1591
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:12,351
Battery lasted for like 30-40 years or something so yeah

1592
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:13,375
He's tough.

1593
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:14,911
Forgot he is dead

1594
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:15,935
Yeah that's true

1595
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:20,031
Probably has nothing to do with the counting the ballots this service cycle

1596
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:21,823
Probably probably

1597
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:22,847
Do we get another gas

1598
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:24,127
Haha

1599
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:25,151
Is pretty excited

1600
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:29,247
Amazing let me just say something I noticed they just did The Joe Rogan

1601
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:32,575
Shining blood coming out the elevators

1602
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:36,671
Stanley Kubrick

1603
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:38,463
And you're sorry what

1604
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:41,791
The movies in

1605
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:44,095
Work with her dad and she's an amazing rain

1606
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:45,119
Another for about

1607
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:45,887
14 years

1608
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:47,167
13 years or so

1609
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:49,983
She's making a long-term documentary

1610
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:51,775
2016

1611
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:55,103
20

1612
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:56,127
Whiter

1613
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:57,663
See that down the road

1614
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:59,199
A long-term documentary

1615
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:00,223
Richard linklater

1616
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:01,503
Calling the kids of their life

1617
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:02,527
But she's here

1618
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:04,575
I'm roping her in

1619
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:07,647
Is done

1620
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:10,975
Where to put the chair in interview Vivian Kubrick

1621
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:11,999
What is the soundtrack

1622
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:13,279
For Full Metal Jacket

1623
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:14,559
And so much more

1624
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:20,959
If she's making a long-term documentary that it all involves like being at Infowars Studio

1625
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:22,495
I mean

1626
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:26,335
It's going to have to be completely detached from reality

1627
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:27,615
Like the

1628
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:31,967
The stuff that you would have to have captured over the course of that time the

1629
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:35,295
Complete change in perspectives the arguments falling

1630
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:36,575
Copart the b*******

1631
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:40,927
Did people really believe in that they pretend they didn't believe in like six months later

1632
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:42,975
Like it's going to be

1633
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:44,255
Like I really am

1634
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,535
It's going to be an editing Channel

1635
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:49,631
To make sense out of all of their life

1636
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:56,031
Yeah 2001

1637
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:59,359
What's she's actually going to do is prove that the moon landing was

1638
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:06,271
She really resents that

1639
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:08,575
Soundtrack to

1640
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:15,231
She doesn't like it when people accuse her father of being involved in taking the moonlight.

1641
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:17,023
People's voter fraud bucker

1642
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:22,911
I don't know well I think that she does believe that but you might not make those direct accusation

1643
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:23,935
On this episode

1644
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:25,471
Becoming

1645
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:26,751
The first

1646
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:27,519
More bar

1647
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:29,567
Critically along the way

1648
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:30,591
Bet the

1649
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:31,615
Tip of the spear

1650
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:33,151
Entire process

1651
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:34,431
The only thing that made

1652
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:35,199
Any

1653
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:36,991
Republican victories tonight possum

1654
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:39,295
Only thing that made any resistant

1655
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:41,087
To the warmest machine

1656
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:42,623
The only thing that made

1657
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:44,415
Any opposition

1658
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:45,183
Another lockdown

1659
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:45,951
The mask

1660
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,487
School shutdowns

1661
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:51,071
In the fourth vaccines and the dangerous gift Leavenworth hotels

1662
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:53,375
Any resistance to it

1663
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:55,167
Was people continuing

1664
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:56,447
Support info

1665
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:58,495
The massive loss

1666
01:16:59,263 --> 01:16:59,775
Being weights again

1667
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:06,943
The only thing that is facilitated or enabled first of all any Republican victories in the midterms

1668
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:09,503
Any opposition to any democratic

1669
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:11,551
Label thing

1670
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:13,087
You giving money to Alec

1671
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:14,111
Yeah I think

1672
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:18,975
Boring saw Alex's mood was like I bet if I give this guy a handjob he'll feel a little bit better

1673
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:21,791
I think I enjoyed it a bit but

1674
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:26,911
Not enough to keep him around much longer cuz I was going to bail your pretty soon

1675
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:29,727
But before that there's a

1676
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:31,519
Little bit of news

1677
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:32,799
Alex's court case

1678
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:35,615
He doesn't talk about himself much

1679
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:39,967
Does not cover himself with no

1680
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:44,063
He comes up in a new cycle he's the tip of the spirits about the Sphere not the

1681
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:45,343
Right

1682
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:50,207
That much

1683
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:52,511
A judge said in court yesterday

1684
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:53,535
Jazz.

1685
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:55,327
Alex Jones

1686
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,607
It'll be on the top of Google

1687
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:58,143
Judd says it's

1688
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:58,911
2 points

1689
01:17:59,167 --> 01:17:59,935
75

1690
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:01,215
Trillian enough

1691
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:03,519
Jupiter Jones

1692
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:07,103
Bad things he's doing what's your all made-up insane

1693
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:08,383
I watch that hearing

1694
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:10,175
Knows because of norm

1695
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:16,575
Play good no amount of money

1696
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:18,879
Was trying to sort of

1697
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:21,439
Facilitated by his own lawyer

1698
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:25,279
He's he was basically daring them to

1699
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,559
Give me to trillion

1700
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:32,447
Not quite what he was doing the saying it shouldn't be really high because no amount of money would

1701
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:36,543
The enough shut up Alex so why even make it really high

1702
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:38,591
Albie Alex's barely

1703
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:40,895
Whatever she's a little bit of a dare

1704
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:43,199
If you say no amount of money will stop him

1705
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:45,247
We'll see if yeah we'll find out what way

1706
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:46,527
So

1707
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:48,319
Alex is not

1708
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:51,391

Joke a lot yet it is tired

1775
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:42,656
He needs to shelve it

1776

01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:48,864
And Amanda Miller

1835
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:49,888
Another special

1836
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:52,704
Contact me where to come out about 30 minutes

1837
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:55,520
She's a great filmmaker on right and her dad

1838
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:57,056
Roatan help Meg

1839
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:57,824
Apocalypse

1840
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,360
Now Dirty Harry

1841
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:02,432
John Miller

1842
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:03,712
Wow wow

1843
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:04,992
These daughters

1844
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:06,272
These icons here

1845
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:09,856
But I got to say who eclipses

1846
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:10,880
John Ellis

1847
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:12,160
Well Stanley Kubrick

1848
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:15,232
We've got his daughter here who I drafted to come on

1849
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:16,512
He's got her camera

1850
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:17,280
You want to have it

1851
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:18,304
Still alive and get the

1852
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:20,608
Jarhead said everything else

1853
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,912
And of course he is Vivian Kubrick

1854
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:24,704
Who was the Protege of the greatest

1855
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:26,496
Hands down

1856
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:27,520
Stanley Kubrick

1857
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:29,312
Great to have you here knowing you for

1858
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:30,848
15 years or so

1859
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:32,128
You're amazing

1860
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:36,736
So a picture of Vivian Kubrick with her headlamp and giron

1861
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:38,016
Went viral

1862
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:41,088
Twitter Ben Collins

1863
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:44,672
Treated at Andrews like things are going well over on Infowars

1864
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:51,072
It is kind of a surreal image person with a head camera on but I think

1865
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:53,632
It was unfair that context was absent

1866
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:54,656
I'm from it that like

1867
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:55,680
You know it make

1868
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:56,960
Since it's not

1869
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:58,240
Insane as it seems

1870
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:00,032
Define shitpost

1871
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:00,800
Stonebank calling

1872
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:04,896
But I think it might have given the impression that things were like more out of

1873
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:07,712
Control on Infowars than they really work

1874
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:09,760
But that's in Fort Worth

1875
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,808
You know how many makes

1876
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:18,208
It's their fault that it's very easy to believe there was that time when I was at a llama

1877
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:19,744
Find studio and

1878
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:21,792
Things were a little out of control

1879
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:26,912
Hatchet about it wasn't a pleasant a play I'm sorry once you get the hamburger

1880
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:28,704
Now I'm lost now

1881
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:29,728
Civilian

1882
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:31,008
Big fan

1883
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:31,776
Infowars

1884
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:33,312
Thank you Alex

1885
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:34,336
I have to say

1886
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:36,128
Infowars

1887
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:37,408
Set of a bit like a

1888
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:41,760
It's seriously I've been so

1889
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:43,808
What is down right now

1890
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:47,904
Probably for 18 years now

1891
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:49,184
And I would say that

1892
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:50,720
Pedigree

1893
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:54,048
You truly have been

1894
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,072
So

1895
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:56,096
Truthful

1896
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:57,376
Correct

1897
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:59,168
I'm on the bowl

1898
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:01,472
And Far Beyond

1899
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:02,752
Is ever reported on what

1900
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:04,288
Actually got on this planet

1901
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,568
Well I tried to be

1902
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:08,128
Overall

1903
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:08,896
I really appreciate

1904
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:09,664
You

1905
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:13,760
Just want to say that everyone here at Infowars

1906
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:16,832
I mean I can tell you from being around here a little bit

1907
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,184
Bring me dedicated to what they doing that

1908
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:21,952
Amistad

1909
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:24,256
As extreme is Alex in many ways

1910
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:25,536
An education

1911
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:26,304
Hangout

1912
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:32,960
But I do want to really underlined

1913
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:34,496
But you have to have Lyft

1914
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:35,264
Listen to Alex

1915
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,032
Liscio's

1916
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:38,336
He said over the years

1917
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:40,896
To really understand how much

1918
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,944
He does so much

1919
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:43,712
Small in space

1920
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:44,992
So deeply about

1921
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:46,784
Warren Way

1922
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:48,832
Nicolas Cage

1923
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:49,600
Beaches

1924
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:51,136
The mainstream media

1925
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:52,160
About him if he

1926
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:55,744
There's no question about that

1927
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:59,072
I'd say he's an imperfect

1928
01:26:59,328 --> 01:26:59,840
Messenger

1929
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:02,400
What he has done

1930
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:03,680
Is I would say this

1931
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:04,960
I'm sure

1932
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:07,264
Spearheaded

1933
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:09,056
Patrice movement on this

1934
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:09,824
TriNet

1935
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:10,592
Wow

1936
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:11,616
That's

1937
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:12,384
I mean look

1938
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:18,784
I do agree with her premise slightly the picture of Alex as a cartoon character who yells his

1939
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:19,552
Is not accurate

1940
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:20,832
But

1941
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:22,112
I would say he's much

1942
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:28,000
Worse and Dumber and more malicious than the character and she's saying that he's so insightful

1943
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:29,280
Speaks to deep truths

1944
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:30,560
Then I think that's horseshit

1945
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:32,864
And I say that with the pedigree of somebody who's

1946
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:37,984
Almost at 750 f****** long podcast episodes analyzing him

1947
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:40,288
And almost six years of my life

1948
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:41,824
Yeah it's been watching

1949
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:42,848
Dumb s***

1950
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,384
Yeah interesting Lee enough

1951
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:46,688
You're far more like Stanley Kubrick than she is

1952
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:47,712
Maybe I mean

1953
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:54,368
Pluck I accuse sort of curmudgeonly right use a little bit of crank notorious perfectionist

1954
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:55,136
And workaholic

1955
01:27:55,648 --> 01:28:01,792
I'm a workaholic I'm not sure I'm a perfectionist if I was I would not allow Alex to be involved in any of my work that's a very good point

1956
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:05,120
Maybe it's an imperfect is a perv

1957
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:07,680
Perfection I would say

1958
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:10,240
Just from my perspective on having

1959
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:12,288
This is anecdotal

1960
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:13,568
I will say

1961
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:14,336
But

1962
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:17,408
Maybe society would be better off if we didn't give a f*** with the

1963
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:18,944
The kids of talented people

1964
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:22,016
Or did

1965
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:26,112
Sort of Bona fides in her own creative

1966
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,416
No I'm fine

1967
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:33,536
Whatever I don't know enough really about her entire resume

1968
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:34,816
The resume that is

1969
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:37,632
Thrown around is all stuff that kind of involves her dad

1970
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:40,960
You know is a composer and has

1971
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:43,520
Made the score for some of these movies and

1972
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:44,544
She has

1973
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,848
And nepotism is always worked out in the past

1974
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:49,920
Look I mean

1975
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:52,992
I think the nepotism is a little bit

1976
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:54,272
But at the same time

1977
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:57,344
Just because you're the child of someone really artistic

1978
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,160
Stickley brilliant doesn't mean

1979
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:00,928
That you

1980
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:05,536
Going to be artistically talented in your own right Nicolas Cage

1981
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:07,072
Sure

1982
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:08,608
I understand

1983
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:13,216
But I would say that there's probably a lot more of the ones that didn't work out like

1984
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:14,752
Yeah probably

1985
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:16,032
Probably

1986
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:18,080
It's it's fine to say that she

1987
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:21,408
She does have artistic Merit of her own accord

1988
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:24,992
I'm fairly comfortable saying that

1989
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:28,320
Now is she on a level even

1990
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:30,112
Quotes to Stanley Kubrick

1991
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:31,648
I would say no

1992
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:36,000
Yeah I've been imagining that she has

1993
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:38,048
Any kind of Gravitas

1994
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:40,096
Approaches that is a little bit

1995
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:42,400
But silly I think she did use also

1996
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:43,168
Broccoli

1997
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:44,960
Xerath did she compose

1998
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,008
Zarathustra

1999
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:50,336
It wasn't $2,000 Full Metal Jacket

2000
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:51,616
So

2001
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:53,408
She thinks that where I were coming

2002
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:55,200
Coming to the something big here

2003
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:56,480
And and what do you make

2004
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:00,576
Say that we are at

2005
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,368
Biblical

2006
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:04,160
Climax

2007
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:05,440
Human history

2008
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:08,000
And that when people should have

2009
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:08,768
You think that

2010
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:09,536
You know

2011
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:10,816
Viewpoint

2012
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:14,656
Say you're mine on everyone had I'll be pointed somehow

2013
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:15,680
Extreme it's because

2014
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:16,960
That's how much

2015
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:17,984
Don't realize you

2016
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:19,264
He's been mind-controlled

2017
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:21,568
It breaks my heart

2018
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:22,848
I want to manage

2019
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:25,664
And right now we seem to have

2020
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:27,200
True enemies

2021
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:28,480
Real enemies

2022
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:29,504
Humanity

2023
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:30,528
Running

2024
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:31,808
And whether it's

2025
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,856
Extraterrestrials or whether it's

2026
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:36,160
Just goddamn horrible psychopath

2027
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,024
How do you get to

2028
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:44,864
To say that it's probably a compressor also man

2029
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:46,400
Think about it not going to Alex

2030
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:51,520
Scolded someone to 2003 % damn God damn whole thing

2031
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:53,568
The lord's name

2032
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:56,384
In vain he's not going to like that Furious

2033
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:58,176
So

2034
01:30:58,432 --> 01:31:02,016
One of the things that I've enjoyed is over the years Alex has mentioned

2035
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:04,320
Knowing Stanley Kubrick's daughter and

2036
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:06,368
Come inside Bass

2037
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,160
About some of the

2038
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:09,184
The cheese told him

2039
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:10,464
Child about Kubrick

2040
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:11,232
Xlife

2041
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:13,280
This is so f****** funny

2042
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:15,328
Talk about

2043
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:17,888
Factory Connection

2044
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:21,216
Loving

2045
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:22,752
What about a book the library

2046
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:25,056
Library somewhere

2047
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:27,104
And it was talking about the CIA

2048
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:27,872
Came to him

2049
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:31,968
How do you know about

2050
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:34,272
The code to the B-52's

2051
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:35,040
How do you know about

2052
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:35,808
Outside

2053
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:38,624
What you told me 15 years ago or so

2054
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,928
So why's your dad

2055
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:41,952
But he was

2056
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:44,000
He was a remote viewer

2057
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:48,096
What time do we have the

2058
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:49,888
Schedule

2059
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:59,360
With you

2060
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:03,712
Alex just took his own story from it

2061
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:06,272
She's talking about dr. Strangelove

2062
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:08,064
And the design of

2063
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,368
The control room or whatever

2064
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:11,648
And

2065
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:13,184
The CIA did

2066
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:16,768
Call or the government calls and asked like how did you come up with that

2067
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:18,304
And he didn't

2068
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,328
It was a

2069
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:20,096
Someone else

2070
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:24,192
The crew made the design of this has created

2071
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:24,960
This entirely

2072
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:29,824
Father story out of the theater remote we were initially psychically knew what the

2073
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:36,224
Fukkk offf being like it's extraterrestrial in nature the government if

2074
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:40,064
People trying to murder us and then being like hey let's calm it down about the

2075
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:46,464
This story okay that'll do directly with a story about her dad probably would like to correct the record

2076
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:48,768
He's not a remote viewer

2077
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:51,840
So she is also into David Icke

2078
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:53,376
Along with Alex

2079
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:54,400
No really

2080
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:57,472
You're going to resent him or the rest of this quote

2081
01:32:57,728 --> 01:32:58,496
Vivian

2082
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:00,032
What

2083
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:02,080
What do you make of the world today

2084
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:03,104
And just

2085
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:03,872
What's happening

2086
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:07,712
What's happening is that

2087
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:08,736
The spirit beings

2088
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:11,296
A being solely test

2089
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:13,600
And whether it's in order to learn

2090
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:14,368
Lessons

2091
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:16,672
As the Eternal being said I believe we are

2092
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:18,976
The biggest test

2093
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,024
That we've ever gone through

2094
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:21,792
Because

2095
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:23,328
Does every recent

2096
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:24,352
Expect that week

2097
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:25,632
Get trapped Aaron

2098
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,752
I think we should all have ideas about

2099
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:33,824
What could be happening but the main thing is we actually have

2100
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:35,360
Push back the Braves

2101
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:36,128
Bacillus

2102
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:38,176
Because the people attacking us

2103
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:39,712
Have courage be

2104
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:40,736
Because I have money

2105
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:42,528
And they have I'm sure

2106
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:45,600
What was it like

2107
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:47,392
Military guys

2108
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:49,440
You know they've got people

2109
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:55,840
Protect them Alex don't like us because he has a lot of money and a lot of mercenaries

2110
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:58,400
Describing Alex

2111
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:06,592
Courageous as a lot of money so much money and X Blackwater people who are on his payroll to protect

2112
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:14,016
Just like I would love to show Vivian a picture of Alex outside the courthouse and Austin with I-10

2113
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:15,296
Security guard

2114
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:16,064
Yeah

2115
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:17,856
Thinking so brave now

2116
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:21,696
Amanda Milius is on and she's she's just there for like

2117
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:22,464
2 minutes

2118
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:23,744
She's on the phone

2119
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,280
And she's with

2120
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:28,864
A guy named Daniel who maybe her husband or something I don't know

2121
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:31,936
But anyways he's involved to stop a steel pretty heavily

2122
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:34,496
And it's cool because like

2123
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:36,800
Her associations with the producers of Alec

2124
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:37,568
What does war

2125
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:39,104
Riot documentary just shows like

2126
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,640
How aboveboard

2127
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:42,688
And unbiased

2128
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:44,480
Character study

2129
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:46,784
Alex that documentary was

2130
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:48,576
Possible for a group of

2131
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:49,344
Tight-knit

2132
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,112
People like that

2133
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:52,672
To make something that wouldn't

2134
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:53,952
Portray Alex in the

2135
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:54,976
Correctly

2136
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:57,792
Correct money corruption would not have

2137
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:02,400
Anyway we're going to get past that a little bit

2138
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:04,192
And just go to Alex

2139
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:05,216
Samsung stupid

2140
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:11,872
Rodger Stone coming up you're going to be covered with olly Alexander

2141
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:13,408
Kitchen off

2142
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:14,688
Tomorrow

2143
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:18,272
Have Harrison Smith myself 11 a.m. you at 3 p.m.

2144
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,576
They said this would take days

2145
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:21,600
Weather

2146
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:22,368
Make a tack

2147
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:25,696
Balance

2148
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:26,720
A real snake

2149
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:28,512
Why is the voting

2150
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:30,816
In all the key District

2151
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:33,632
So what you see here is Alex articulating that they can

2152
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:35,936
Conspiracy he primed his audience for didn't

2153
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:37,984
Match the situation that was playing out

2154
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:42,080
He was expecting for there to be a giant red tsunami as he said

2155
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:43,616
No times on this stream

2156
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:50,016
And that late in the evening or early morning the margins would narrow and he would then claim that it's the result of a ton of fake ballots being

2157
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:50,784
Pumped into the box

2158
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:57,696
Closely with the conspiracies laid out by Alex and folks like Mike Lindell about the 2020 election analysis

2159
01:35:57,952 --> 01:36:02,304
Preparing his listeners to watch this stream under the pretense that this was what they were going to see again

2160
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,608
Yeah it was the 2020 election to

2161
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:06,400
Where are the 2020

2162
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:07,168
However

2163
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:08,960
Bpop was underperforming

2164
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:12,288
Even early in the night so this whole game just doesn't play

2165
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:18,944
If Republicans are losing Arizona and so many of these races are really close to this early then the predetermined storyline

2166
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:20,224
Isn't really going to fly

2167
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:25,856
This is Alex thinking on his feet and coming up with a new framework for the audience to use to claim that the election

2168
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:29,696
Beast Machines breaking down in key districts

2169
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:30,464
That's to blame

2170
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:36,864
Keep in mind that I was not proven in any way that machines are broken down in key districts nor is he even Illustrated it pours

2171
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:42,752
The closest thing was that one caller from before Alex was even there that was those too much humidity in Oak

2172
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:46,592
Oklahoma and no matter where he was in Oklahoma that was not a key disc

2173
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:52,480
This is a good illustration of why fact-checking doesn't really matter in terms of opposing someone like Alex

2174
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:55,296
He just made me factors whatever reality is most

2175
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:57,856
Convenient for him and allows him to tell the stories he wants

2176
01:36:58,112 --> 01:37:00,928
Hospital will be most profitable to tell his audience

2177
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,488
A respectful realities existence is a

2178
01:37:03,744 --> 01:37:05,024
Requirement for having your back

2179
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:07,072
And I would still give a s*** about that

2180
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:09,888
It's the same thing that same Dynamic it was a player

2181
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:13,728
When trying to check the pasta results in Philadelphia County

2182
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:17,312
It doesn't matter you're just going to come up with a new story

2183
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:18,336
That under

2184
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:21,664
Undergirds the point that you want to make

2185
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:22,944
Because the the

2186
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:25,760
Central idea that they're expressing is I'm right

2187
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:29,344
And then if you come up with information that shows they're wrong

2188
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:33,696
You just need to re-enter that information in a way that shows that I

2189
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:34,720
Even more right than

2190
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:37,280
Involves

2191
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:40,352
Making something up entirely at the best way to do it

2192
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:42,912
Argue with me I made it up

2193
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:46,752
So Alex is going home and you sounds a little rough

2194
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:51,872
And I'm out of my sports jacket

2195
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:59,808
Said the terrorists Republicans are going to blow stuff up

2196
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:02,112
Only election

2197
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:03,648
False flag

2198
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:07,488
They cannot

2199
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:09,536
Lucia power

2200
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:15,168
Sponsors

2201
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:18,240
Battleground areas all shutdown

2202
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:19,776
They have done again.

2203
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:26,688
Dictatorship

2204
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:28,992
So this isn't that much later than

2205
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:30,528
Other stuff

2206
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:32,064
You went from zero to drunk

2207
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:38,720
Like real fast pronunciation

2208
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:39,488
Wow

2209
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:40,768
That happened quick

2210
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:47,168
Got a lot of paper cups rolling around unless Solo cups hanging out underneath that death

2211
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:53,568
I don't know what the deal is maybe he was thinking like I'm going to be in this for the Long Haul them things weren't working out Tuesday

2212
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:55,104
How to get drunk go home

2213
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:57,408
But whatever the case he sounds rough

2214
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:04,064
Really fully know if Rodger Stone does show up after Alex left because I'm not going to watch 8 hours of

2215
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:06,368
Taken

2216
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:07,136
Call

2217
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:10,720
Listen for a little bit longer to see what was going on and here's

2218
01:39:10,976 --> 01:39:11,744
Just our last clipper

2219
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:12,512
The valley

2220
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:13,792
Being real dumb

2221
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:15,840
You know let me go into Claire this

2222
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:17,376
Let me go and declare this

2223
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:19,168
We live in a Banana Republic

2224
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:20,448
I say that was

2225
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:22,752
I say that with conviction

2226
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:25,568
And I say that we can establish that is a matter of

2227
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:26,336
We live

2228
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:27,360
Banana Republic

2229
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:29,664
Infowars

2230
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:31,968
Was cranes years ago at the beginning of my career

2231
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:33,248
And now I've liked

2232
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:35,808
These are my ride or die Brothers

2233
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:36,832
Call Bro

2234
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:37,856
I'm glad I'm on this

2235
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:38,880
Yeah

2236
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:44,512
I understand the image of that Miley is trying to evoke with the term Banana Republic but I don't think he actually knows what that means

2237
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:45,792
He just thinks

2238
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:49,632
Place that subject to colonialism like to say that the Democrats

2239
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:52,704
The colonize the us but that's not what a Banana Republic is

2240
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:58,336
Very specifically at Banana Republic is characterized by being a country whose economy is solely dependent on

2241
01:39:58,592 --> 01:40:00,384
Exporting its own natural resources

2242
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:07,040
Typically this involves a single resource That's the basis of the economy like of the bananas were in Central America

2243
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:10,880
Guatemala when they were under the sway of giant America

2244
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:11,648
Fruit company

2245
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:14,464
You can make the argument that the way that those large

2246
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:20,096
Corporations held so much political power based on their control over a single resource with those countries economy relied on

2247
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:24,448
It's similar to how many of the giant companies in the US have outside political influence

2248
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:25,984
Their involvement things like

2249
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:31,360
The energy markets but I don't think that's a conversation Ali or anyone it informs really wants to have because

2250
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:34,176
At the end of the day they're on the side of those big Corporation

2251
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:35,456
Who sang makes no sense

2252
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:37,760
Look I was just trying to have a big

2253
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:39,552
Dramatic moment but

2254
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:41,856
Comes off as a little bit crayon negro

2255
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:44,928
Hang out with your ride or die LOL

2256
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:46,208
Why are WeedMaps

2257
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:47,744
Fascist can't use

2258
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:50,048
Slang terms like that

2259
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:51,072
Annoying

2260
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:52,352
/

2261
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:53,632
Uno

2262
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:55,680
And I'm not even a fascist

2263
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:58,752
I I just think it's a little dumb

2264
01:40:59,008 --> 01:41:00,544
Honest

2265
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:01,312
Leslie

2266
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:02,848
IWatch

2267
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:03,872
A lot of

2268
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:08,224
Infowars election night coverage of the debate night coverage

2269
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:10,272
What time does La more fireworks

2270
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:11,040
This was

2271
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:13,600
Yeah it was

2272
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:14,880
COA

2273
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:20,768
Yeah it's it was I think that was a weird night then especially just because the polling like

2274
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:22,048
The day before

2275
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:23,584
Once you got to like

2276
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:25,376
Here's everybody's pulling information

2277
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:27,936
It was all like the margin of error is

2278
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:28,704
Four Points

2279
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:30,240
That could go either way

2280
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:32,288
It is it was literally like okay

2281
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:38,944
Tomorrow night the Dems might be up by 4 or the Republicans could have won everything everything started happening and we were like

2282
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:40,736
This is going to be exactly

2283
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:41,504
The same tomorrow

2284
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:42,528
Forever

2285
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:43,808
Yeah app

2286
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:46,112
I think if Alex wasn't

2287
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:49,440
On if you didn't need money and need to do a Telethon

2288
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:52,512
And if you wasn't on bannon's thing like

2289
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:54,048
I don't even understand the premise

2290
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:54,816
Doing this

2291
01:41:55,072 --> 01:42:01,216
Like there was no one exciting on it and Alexander Laurel Uber Drew Hernandez

2292
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:01,984
Jim cool

2293
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:03,520
You had Mike Adams

2294
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:04,800
Robert Barnes

2295
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:07,616
Maybe Rodger showed up after Alex left

2296
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:10,432
Look it's nothing it was what I felt like

2297
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:11,968
It was going through the motions

2298
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:16,320
Like they felt obligated to do a livestream

2299
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:17,856
I agree with

2300
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:19,136
Except

2301
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:20,416
40in with the Big Mac

2302
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:21,440
Okay that's fine

2303
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:25,536
I'm really trying that really was

2304
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:31,936
Trying really hard to give the appearance of try

2305
01:42:32,192 --> 01:42:34,240
I I meant I meant if it was his idea

2306
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:35,776
If but it can't pause

2307
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,848
Owen wasn't the one that was like let me go to app

2308
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:42,176
Well maybe maybe

2309
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:48,576
It's it's creating the appearance of being like a big boy show

2310
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:49,600
Infowars

2311
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:50,624
Cute and

2312
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:52,160
And he's

2313
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:56,000
So anyway we come to the end of this

2314
01:42:56,256 --> 01:42:57,280
Stand up

2315
01:42:57,536 --> 01:43:00,864
I don't know midterms did with a dad and Alex did what he did and who

2316
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:01,632
It's great

2317
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:04,704
Besito bar

2318
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:16,992
Until then I mean

2319
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:18,016
Clark

2320
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:19,808
Do do do-do-do-do

2321
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:21,088
If you read the WikiLeaks

2322
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:25,184
The sex robot

2323
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:27,744
Holding

2324
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:30,816
Alex

2325
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:31,584
Kristen color
