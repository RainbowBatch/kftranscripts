Knowledge party.com

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for knowledge babe I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
MoneyGram

4
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,344
Dot-com

6
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,584
Alex Jones

7
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,656
Indeed we are.

8
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:19,360
Well I'd like to thank everybody who responded to the call for submissions

9
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:26,272
Do the anti-communism library more than you would have expected a few and I appreciate it start building

10
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:30,624
Hats and we'll see where that takes us

11
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,440
It's very exciting new project

12
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,720
It's not back to the 60

13
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,536
Me as well but we'll see

14
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,864
I want to try and create a a nice

15
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,400
Compendium of

16
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:47,008
Yamcha's almost

17
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,800
Literally want to always have

18
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,824
The documents at this point

19
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,872
Yeah you want them

20
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,688
Yeah man and there's something

21
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,016
So interesting about holding these like

22
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,672
Pieces of weirdo history like these American opinions and one of them is addressed

23
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,720
Some of them have address labels on them

24
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:10,304
One of them went to a guy in Monaco

25
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:17,984
Okay alright Diane Monica was reading a John Birch stuff and somehow that's ended up in my hands

26
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,032
Nuts yeah there is

27
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,336
There is a part of me that is like

28
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:28,736
I I walked in and I saw those and it was a little bit like catching you with dirty magazines like it felt a little bit

29
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,784
You shouldn't have those out

30
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,088
Plato

31
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,112
Is everywhere

32
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:38,720
And that also wanted to take this opportunity to say to folks

33
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,768
Your buttons are still coming out

34
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,048
They're still being sent

35
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,096
I hope to have it done by the end of the year

36
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:47,424
To give some just a little bit of an idea

37
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,192
I'm going

38
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,216
Through the

39
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,312
Baby email inbox from

40
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,360
First received two most recent

41
00:02:55,616 --> 00:03:01,760
Andre 3000

42
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,064
I have no idea how many already

43
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,904
Yeah there is there is nothing about us only being two people

44
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,952
Yeah

45
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,232
And having

46
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:16,352
Really no situational awareness

47
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:22,752
Absolutely no concept of like I got an email from somebody who's like it we can help

48
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,800
You track your Lister Bezos I got to

49
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:30,688
With what magic why

50
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,480
What are you

51
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,272
What

52
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,344
It did we talk okay

53
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,880
See what

54
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,672
My bright spot is

55
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,696
I don't know if

56
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,976
You've heard of these two

57
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,256
Young up-and-coming

58
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,816
Gentleman Dave Anthony and Gareth Reynolds

59
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:47,840
I've spoken

60
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:51,424
You have Dave still not spoken to me I think that's on purpose

61
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,240
Is this point I think they would be willing to talk to you

62
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,824
Willing

63
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,408
I know they have a new show called The pastime

64
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,224
And it could not be more

65
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,248
It's like

66
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,064
Iat's my alley in a way that I

67
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,440
I can't even comprehend lights newspaper base

68
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,000
Completely different from the dollop see Dave read something

69
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,280
Ceguera to react to it

70
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:22,143
No but he picks a newspaper from a random

71
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,679
Place in the past or whatever

72
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,447
And just reads

73
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,495
To you and the reason that this hit

74
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,775
Me so hard is because

75
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,823
We listen to it I remember

76
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,639
That when I was growing up in my hometown

77
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,687
There is this historical society

78
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,735
Had all these microfiche

79
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,295
Newspapers and I f****** read

80
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,111
Constantly I love reading those

81
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,903
To the point where one cent

82
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,743
This is always stuck out not sentence like a little fragment is always stuck in my head which

83
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,511
She's just a

84
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,791
Another ham with Missy

85
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,071
Like I said it's like

86
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:55,423
I can't believe this

87
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,471
Get newspapers used to be a little different

88
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,031
The writing of it was a little different

89
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,079
It's snowing in LA

90
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:08,735
I did the days of hams going Michigan you miss it

91
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,527
Right right that's the message

92
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:16,671
It is it is so much

93
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,743
I was so angry too when I listen to it cuz I was like

94
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:26,655
That was my childhood and bait turned into a show goddamn going to have a show

95
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:32,543
No but it's great it's really really good I've not had a chance to check it out yet but I've heard from multiple people that is

96
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:38,943
It's a quite good

97
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,575
So Jordan today we have an episode to go over going to be talking about

98
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:50,207
Friday's show that November 11th 2022 okay this is

99
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,743
Post midterms

100
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:55,839
Post Alex having a another half billion dollars tax Yahoo

101
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,863
Is she at

102
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:01,215
Post having his assets somewhat Frozen until there's a hearing in

103
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,007
Early December I believe

104
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,335
Either way

105
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:12,735
But actually I ate you would not know it by just listening to this episode

106
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,063
I ended up spending

107
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,647
Way too much f****** time on something that is

108
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,439
Completely pointless

109
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,231
And we'll discuss it when we get to it

110
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:26,303
Do you mean one of our highlights

111
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:32,703
So let's say hello

112
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,543
Arguments Ace associate Morgan Stringer

113
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:42,687
Very much next Jordans laugh is everything and I know because I'm a Jordan

114
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,479
I do think it's about you and how about we walk

115
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,343
Gorilla with us watch Bass

116
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,367
Vector robot

117
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,695
I don't know why I couldn't

118
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:58,815
I could not read that in these heroes in a Half-Shell rhythm

119
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
I think I just

120
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:05,727
The man the myth and now the Policy Journal policy walk

121
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:11,871
Next Kiki's Brightspot delivery service

122
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,199

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,295
I appreciate it Alyssa pants

124
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,647
Picture of Jordan

125
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:29,279
So I thank you so much to Jackson Mississippi doesn't have running water and no one seems to care please send help

126
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,351
We are not the sort of people to

127
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,911
Don't send emergency messages

128
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,215
Timely message

129
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,775
Oh no

130
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:45,151
Don't get mad and tell your brother someone

131
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,175
Sodomites

132
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,951
I don't want

133
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,743
Jesus Christ

134
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,047
Thank you so much

135
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,839
Souderton

136
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,399
Not all the return

137
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
Time to come in

138
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:11,775
And so they're still little bit of optimism

139
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,055
Here

140
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:18,687
And this time they might still win the Senate that's what we're talkin about

141
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,319
/

142
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,719
Friday

143
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,255
So they lost both

144
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,279
Yeah

145
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,863
Hope Springs Eternal on Friday

146
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:40,703
And they have not had to turn this into a voter fraud

147
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,727
Conspiracy

148
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:45,055
Yeah it is kind of funny how they like

149
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,079
If they

150
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,895
Ben went if the Democrats have been waiting by more

151
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,943
The Republicans almost would have been in no more

152
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,991
Comfortable position to claim that it was fraud

153
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,831
As opposed to having like a lead for so long that they're like

154
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,623
Well we can't call it Friday yet

155
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,159
You know that

156
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:05,535
Don't say fraud until you see the whites of their eyes

157
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:09,375
So Alex is a news story that has nothing to do with the political

158
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,167
Sweetheart

159
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,447
Really really shity

160
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,751
What are the big news Ruby getting

161
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,127
Baby used mRNA

162
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,919
Technology in hundreds of studies

163
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,199
With Vaughn

164
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,015
Not just here but around 1 a.m. quino

165
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
Everyday

166
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,159
Portion

167
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,511
Of the individuals that have a tested on them die

168
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,791
Horribly painful.

169
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,631
Livers

170
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
Coagulate

171
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,263
And it's happened again

172
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,079
New York man dies while they

173
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,895
Editing technology Chris

174
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,967
What do you think they just did

175
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,015
Where the MRNA shots

176
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,063
Do hundreds and hundreds and

177
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,367
I'm over a million people.

178
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:08,767
So Alex is not in any way establish that mRNA technology used in tests in the past has killed a ton of people

179
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,815
I would fact check this but he's not being

180
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,095
Specific about what test

181
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:16,191
He's talking about so he's not even really making a claim worth being taken seriously

182
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,775
If you have some examples I'd be happy to engage with them at that point

183
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,311
But this is just talkingshit

184
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,359
What else is it isn't true

185
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,895
And that's why he has no specific

186
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,711
Well based upon what he saying the

187
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,015
Action of the symptoms that he's described

188
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:36,415
Brain rot has happened liver time before that I can recall and that was

189
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,951
At a certain point

190
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,487
The Arc of

191
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,511
The Covenant was open

192
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,303
Sure

193
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
Exactly

194
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:49,471
And if you don't avert your eyes from the MRNA guess what happened

195
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,775
MRN Ark

196
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:58,943
There we go New York man Alex doesn't have any of the information on this that's worth reporting like there's nothing

197
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,783
But he knows that brings us to the level of it being perfect

198
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,831
To be on his show

199
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,647
This is about twenty-seven year-old Terry Horton

200
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,975
Who suffered from a very rare form of muscular dystrophy

201
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:15,071
His brother Richard was the head of a nonprofit called cure rare disease

202
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:15,839
Would you let a push

203
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,143
Exploring gene-editing therapy possibilities

204
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,191
Four conditions like the one his brother hat

205
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,007
Terry was going to get a tailor-made treatment

206
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,055
And it's signed up for it but he passed

207
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:30,687
According to statmuse quote it's unclear when or even if he received the experimental

208
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,783
In reality this is a rare condition that is

209
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,319
Pretty commonly fatal

210
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:40,415
It's been estimated that between the ages of 20 and 25 86

211
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,231
6 out of 1,000 patients with this condition would die

212
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:47,839
And past the age of 40 that number goes up to 336 out of 1000

213
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
Every year

214
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:55,519
The median survival age of someone born in the year that Terry was with his condition is 28.1 years

215
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:59,103
Which is close to 27 which was the age of that Year's

216
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:04,735
We don't know if he even got the treatment and even if he did we have no idea if it was connected to his passing

217
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,295
YouTube we do find out that it was

218
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:12,415
Connected to the treatment it wasn't an mRNA treatment and it has nothing to do with covid

219
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:17,023
I was just a monster trying to capitalize on this young man's death and exploit him

220
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,559
So he can be used as a prop

221
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,095
The push anti-vax bulshit

222
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:24,191
It's disgraceful and if I were this guy's brother I would probably think about suing a

223
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,215
Yeah I mean this

224
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:29,311
Leave this one alone I feel like this is a situation

225
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,847
If I understand correctly

226
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,151
Where there's a non-profit

227
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,431
Like

228
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,223
Geared towards people who have

229
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,503
Diseases that are

230
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,527
Everywhere

231
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:45,439
Impossible for a pharmacy company or anything to think what we need to develop a therapy

232
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,743
I wouldn't be within their profit motive

233
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:54,143
So you're not going to wind up getting all of the trials and everything you need to develop any therapy within any kind of reasonable

234
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,703
Length of time through the FDA or all of those

235
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,287
Possible channels if you go through all these tests and all that stuff

236
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,335
Something along those lines where it is

237
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,127
Hey we got this rare disease

238
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,151
We've got

239
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,479
People who are in a situation where it's like hey

240
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,759
Oh my God

241
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,295
This hasn't been tested enough

242
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:17,695
Who f****** cares man I don't know another would have looked into it enough to know so I don't want to sign off on your

243
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,071
Said sum

244
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,863
Vitro

245
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,167
I'm not saying they're like

246
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:33,567
Hey we found something in the woods I don't think it I don't think it is like that but

247
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,895
I do I do think there is something to the

248
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:41,503
The snow just the reality that some of these larger pharmaceutical companies wouldn't

249
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,527
Explorer

250
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,343
It wouldn't be in their interest to explore some of these things so that's

251
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,903
Some of the work that's left to smaller nonprofit

252
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,207
That's more my description

253
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:50,975
It is that they would

254
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,767
Have any reason cuz they were about

255
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,863
Getting old this this is sad

256
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,143
No matter what no matter what

257
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,191
Alex using it

258
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,215
For his own purposes

259
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,751
Sucks

260
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,287
Just leave everybody like that

261
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,567
So now back to Paula

262
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,871
So that's coming up as well

263
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,663
Call Diane boil bunch of globalism

264
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,223
Come out and help World Government we got that for you

265
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,135
Right in

266
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,951
Do all of the election news and boy

267
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,767
Suspected fraud Tuesday night

268
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,815
Now the evidence is overwhelming

269
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,399
Got the trumpet Santa Civil War kicked off by Trump

270
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,703
Got mixed feelings about that

271
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,775
But you do Civil Wars are supposed to work

272
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,079
Mixed feelings about home

273
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:44,479
I mean do you know when you're fighting brother against brother the point not ideological let's stop slavery part obviously

274
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,551
How much does a mixed feelings about V Civil War

275
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,575
Mixed feelings about this

276
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:53,439
To Alex's no concrete evidence

277
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,463
Anyway

278
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:58,303
Election fraud check but he is now definitively proven dead

279
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,351
Also every single episode

280
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:03,679
Not every episode episode 3 can go back through like

281
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:08,799
A decade ago 15 years ago and he has a piccolo blister announcing world government

282
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,847
Say finally come out and said it like

283
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,639
Wow

284
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,175
The blase nature of the way he

285
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:19,295
He describes it too as though it's another blind news-item coming up as I'd like it if there's a

286
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,831
Actually World Government announced

287
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,111
I'm going to hear about it

288
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:26,463
As more of a big deal 7-ounce world government and in other news

289
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,767
Squirrel water skiing exactly

290
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:32,095
Another ham stolen

291
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,887
Stolen by the EU

292
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:34,911
Exactly

293
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,935
So Alex

294
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,215
Does not like this

295
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:41,055
Idea the trumpet DeSantis are fighting I get it I understand

296
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,359
Also we're going to be looking at

297
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,639
What Trump said last

298
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,919
Night on the street social

299
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,967
Coming out and attacking

300
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,991
Governor DeSantis

301
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,527
Not a good idea

302
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,087
Corporate Media One

303
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159
New York Times

304
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:56,927
Fox News

305
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,207
All of the established

306
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:58,975
Media

307
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,023
Other than a few exceptions like Erik Karlsson

308
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,559
Have come out

309
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,375
And have praised the Santas in attack

310
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,143
Trump

311
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,935
Trump the reason we didn't

312
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,751
When bigger in the midterms and all this made up garbage

313
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,543
To get us fighting with each other and

314
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,823
Trump with his ego

315
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,847
Big is the moon

316
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,151
Aztec in the bank know I love Trump

317
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
And come out attack

318
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,199
Pakistan has

319
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
Never

320
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,271
Attacked from

321
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,855
So now it's not about a stolen election

322
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,135
Captain Steel

323
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:30,719
Now some about buying me a tea and a geriatric patient up Federman

324
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,743
Mega Million

325
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
Destroyed

326
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,303
Giant

327
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,863
Zombie Goblin leader

328
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,911
It's not him that if

329
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,935
About Trump

330
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,727
Trump

331
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,007
Is the reason Republicans

332
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,543
Didn't win bigger

333
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,823
Total distraction

334
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,103
From reality

335
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,639
Waited

336
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,407
Straight in

337
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,711
Diane is attacking to Santa

338
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,479
I wish

339
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,551
Zombie Goblin leader

340
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,111
Struggling to land that's it

341
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:58,879
Hoobly

342
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,975
Do you can hear Alex Express in something in this clip that makes a lot of sense

343
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:07,071
He doesn't like the idea of trump into Santa's fighting because that's a

344
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,607
Repeating narrative from his own

345
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,375
And it's one that

346
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,655
He can't really profit from

347
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:14,239
Alex wants all the right-wing audience to be swept up in this stop this

348
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:19,615
Fuel type stuff for he could do another dumb Caravan tour and yell at rallies about how much proof he has of Alexa

349
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
Brought

350
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,151
That's great

351
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:27,551
Wait for Alex because he can make a lot of money off that never has to prove a damn thing

352
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,599
Conversely

353
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,647
Trump DeSantis is a dead end

354
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,671
That fight is

355
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:39,071
Is no good for Alex because neither choice is really that great for his bottom line and if the audience is forced to pick a side because there

356
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,887
Fighting Alex is expected to have a position

357
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:48,799
Alex is already done his whole I give Trump two weeks to come out against the vaccine or else I'll attack him and Trump didn't give a single

358
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,567
Bulshit

359
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,615
How much is already embarrassed himself with his concert

360
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:55,199
I swear I'm leaving this time for real

361
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:58,783
If he does actually decide that he doesn't want to be on Trump side anymore

362
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:04,415
It won't have any impact on the only result will be pissing off the members of his audience that still like Trump

363
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:09,279
Staying as things are and being on Trump's team again is also embarrassing

364
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,327
Because Alex made all these ultimatums

365
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,143
Trump didn't care which shows that Alex is a spineless coward

366
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,679
On the flip side

367
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,983
Going over to DeSantis has its own problem

368
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:22,591
Many of the listeners particularly long-term listeners have a little bit of Hero 4

369
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:29,503
They were sold a bill of goods about how Trump was going to change everything and he was the god appointed leader they needed to trust no matter what

370
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,527
What and what did it amount to

371
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,111
Basically nothing but chaos and an ego-driven a******

372
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,135
Picking fights

373
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:40,767
Haven't gone through all that it's understandable as many of the listeners aren't super Keen to adopt a new god-king

374
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:43,327
Once Bitten Twice Shy and all that

375
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,887
There's problems here with this fight

376
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,447
This is not the State of Affairs Alex wants to see

377
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:55,103
In a perfect world jump into Santa's work together or at very least they would be like kind of respecting opponents

378
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,127
So I wouldn't have to pick

379
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,151
Decide this early

380
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,479
This is clearly bad for his wallet

381
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:01,759
At this point

382
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,295
Yeah I mean

383
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,575
I feel like the

384
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,879
The the main issue for him

385
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,647
Is

386
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:09,951
He's kind of

387
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,975
Pot committed with

388
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,743
Trump

389
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:15,327
Less because of the Electoral body kind of

390
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,351
Situation

391
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,399
And more so just because of the

392
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,423
Personality

393
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,703
Connection to the two of them

394
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,495
He's not going to relate to

395
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:25,567
The Santa send a scientist is never going to give Alex

396
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:29,919
Probably not you never really would think

397
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,479
I've been surprised

398
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,527
True that's true

399
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,807
Santa's cookies

400
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:40,415
True but I mean it's the point that everybody is making about their fight

401
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,719
Is that people are tired of trump

402
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:46,047
And would rather have DeSantis someone who is less like Trump

403
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,071
It makes even

404
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,375
Way lessons for Ed DeSantis to be like

405
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,167
And now Alex is my buddy

406
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:55,775
What that loud bombastic a****** right around

407
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:59,103
Sort of lesson the appeal of the I'm not Trump thing

408
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,711
So I feel like I'm

409
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:06,783
Is right you're right that Alex is Sodapop committed with

410
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,575
Trump but I also don't think

411
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,855
He'd understand

412
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,927
And he should dumb

413
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:17,535
No just like our last episode Ali Alexandra saying that it forwards there is ride or dies

414
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,607
Right right I am the Galaxy

415
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,471
Stay to his word and be ride-or-die with here's what I say

416
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,495
Here's what I say

417
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,263
That they have

418
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,031
To-do list

419
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,567
The smart play for Alec

420
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,335
Exo-k

421
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,383
Say

422
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,943
I don't care which of them comes out on

423
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:38,015
Because whoever comes out on top is going to be the better

424
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,551
Candidates because they're going to

425
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:42,879
To fight each other so much harder than any Democrat

426
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:47,743
Could fight that all of their bullshiter be out and by the time that we're ready to play against the Democrats

427
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,511
Will be on

428
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,279
Unstoppable

429
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:52,863
I think iron sharpens iron that kind of like this

430
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:59,263
It doesn't work when it's Trump and decide to get so ugly

431
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,031
But they don't

432
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:00,799
No cuz you

433
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,567
You can't

434
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,591
Hold back

435
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,871
Wow it's getting ugly

436
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,639
Bright light

437
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:11,039
Let's see who comes out on top

438
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:16,928
That would be the fun thing that's what they that's what they what would drive money to Alex

439
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,720
Is non-stop fighting

440
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,536
Sure but you have to have

441
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,304
Your side

442
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:28,448
You can't have non-stop fighting and it being like what let's look at these two fight

443
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,216
Like

444
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,264
Trump and Hillary in 20

445
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,288
16 wooden

446
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,312
Has been

447
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,872
Valuable to Alex if he wasn't

448
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:42,272
I like into Trump and hated Hillary the interest of the audience

449
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,296
I'm so like if

450
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:47,904
It's two guys who you're but you're supposed to like both of them and they f****** hate each other

451
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,184
That's kind of difficult

452
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,464
But here's the thing

453
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,000
That people are discount

454
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,304
And that is that the way you get

455
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,072
Famous

456
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,352
Is you have

457
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,888
Rap battles man

458
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:03,776
I'm talking now hold on just a good idea

459
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:07,104
Rivaling you got to have fights going on and then ever

460
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,688
Everybody is like we got to pay attention to this that's the way you do it

461
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,736
DeSantis shows up and he's like

462
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,272
Do it absolutely

463
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,552
Alex is like

464
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,344
Yeah

465
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,136
Alex

466
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,696
Doesn't like Trump statement

467
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,464
Social

468
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,488
He also thinks it's

469
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,280
True

470
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,328
Great

471
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,912
Wish you would have come out against them

472
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,960
But overall

473
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,544
Bubbles take Trump more than anybody's Anti New World Order

474
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,592
He's obviously better the Democrats

475
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,152
We need to not be fighting with him

476
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,736
We need

477
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,272
Not be

478
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,552
Battling

479
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:48,832
With each other

480
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:49,856
Really is

481
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,624
That's simple

482
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:54,976
Statement by President Donald J Trump what is the president of States of America

483
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,304
Weboost

484
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,096
Santa should not him

485
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,120
For president Ann

486
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,912
He made the Santa

487
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,472
Santa says all these neocon

488
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,752
Fluttering around DVDs

489
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,032
Many ways which is true

490
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,848
I don't like Jeb Bush hanging around I don't like me

491
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,872
Ronnie hang around

492
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,176
You know what trumps hung out with all those guys

493
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,992
Statim in the back so

494
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,784
The jury's out on that

495
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:22,112
With the Santas and I'm not going to get in this house Bagent

496
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,160
Trump's better or DeSantis

497
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,440
Better Trump's words

498
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,280
And people need to stay focus

499
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,304
Contemplation

500
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,584
The open borders

501
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,608
Exploding crime

502
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,144
The war in Ukraine

503
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,424
Stop the poison shot

504
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,216
Outlet mall

505
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,264
Injections in lockdown

506
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,128
The future I'm a good luck trying to take some kind of a high road

507
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:51,552
Gossip show for the extreme-right like word start flying it's going to be like all out

508
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:55,648
Could talk about y'all be like

509
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,440
What do you think about this

510
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,464
It'll be

511
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,840
Conspicuous if he doesn't get in the mud and make it a beauty pageant absolutely zero people

512
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,120
I think that

513
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,656
0 people want

514
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,424
What's that

515
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,472
We all got to come together

516
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,752
Message from Al

517
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:15,360
Yeah you can have those with some people on the right walk though we should all come together maybe

518
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:18,432
Most of them aren't that but you're not going to Alex

519
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:20,736
To get it now but I also think that your

520
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,272
Maybe mischaracterizing what

521
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,040
He means by

522
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,648
Kumbaya here

523
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:34,048
Is more like we all got to get together with the narrative can't let this be the thing Everybody's Talkin about

524
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,072
Because if it is

525
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,096
I can

526
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,376
I got no roots

527
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,400
Play here

528
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:41,984
What you don't want Alex to be the guy saying don't fight

529
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,752
He's Alex

530
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:47,616
F****** Jones January 6th and was yelling in the bowl horny on everybody

531
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,944
School around hasn't gotten better since then has it

532
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,736
So

533
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,064
I don't know who is dating who

534
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:56,832
I don't know

535
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,624
Dallas making it

536
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,720
About the Democrats trying to steal the election in blunting the victory

537
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,536
Instead of making it

538
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:09,632
About how we need to get rid of the Republican neocon rhino

539
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,192
Corporatist leadership

540
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:14,240
Like Mitch McConnell than others

541
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,288
Instead of that

542
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,312
It's all about

543
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,336
DeSantis

544
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:22,688
And that's why the Republican establishment has weighed in with the liberal media

545
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,736
Try to create a trump

546
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:25,760
Shrimp

547
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,040
An old

548
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,064
45

549
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,344
I've taken the bait

550
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,672
Something take anybody

551
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:36,000
He's just an a****** people constantly

552
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:40,096
He feels like his position in the extreme right-wing Spears threatened by DeSantis because

553
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,144
It is so he's attacking him

554
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,520
It's honestly shocking the Trump waited until after the midterm 100% I guess that's a pretty good

555
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:50,592
But you don't want the Democrat to win the Florida governor race

556
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,408
Particularly because Trump lives in Florida

557
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:58,528
Bob so you wait till immediately after to attack because at this point it's about the 2020

558
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,552
4 general election

559
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:04,928
That is an amazing amount of restraint for someone like Trump to his house

560
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:09,024
I mean what I say goes back to what Alex said earlier of his like Trump attack

561
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,584
With a dentist Easton nobody attacked first

562
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,120
Yeah

563
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:17,728
What did you expect Trump to only attack in retaliation that's

564
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:24,128
It's the way you view him as a pacifist until you come at him he's not at all aggressive

565
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:27,200
Alright

566
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,224
So you some good news

567
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,272
Soccer news

568
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
It's kind of fun

569
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,064
Owen

570
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,856
It's still reporting from the bay

571
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,136
Big boy

572
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:43,840
I like to imagine that he hasn't life is tied with one ankle doing

573
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,376
He's got it

574
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:51,776
Necktie like I'm done these he's Haggard but he still

575
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,080
Needs a checking in on Arizona

576
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,128
Stan right now

577
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,688
I don't like what I'm seeing in Arizona

578
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,712
Despite the

579
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,480
Confidence

580
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,504
That Lake

581
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,528
In Masters

582
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,552
Still have

583
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,832
That these late

584
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,600
Night latch

585
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,624
Ballot dump

586
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,648
The favor that I'm

587
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,928
I'm just not seeing it

588
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,464
They're not getting the returns

589
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,232
Please.

590
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,768
They thought they were going to be getting about sick

591
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,792
60 even even

592
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:14,560
70 /

593
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:17,376
I'm some of these last-minute returns coming from work

594
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,400
Conservative areas

595
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,424
They're just not getting

596
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,448
They're just not

597
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,984
Katie Hobbs lead

598
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,008
Was actually

599
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,032
Send it

600
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:24,800
Last night

601
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,592
With the late night

602
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,872
Last minute ballot drops

603
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,408
And they say 82

604
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,432
Percent RN

605
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,968
So

606
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,760
This is going to be a miracle comeback

607
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,552
I think for Kari Lake

608
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,088
And then even farther behind

609
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,136
How is Blake Masters

610
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,160
To the incoming

611
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,440
Mark Kelly

612
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,976
Isle at that will take

613
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:43,744
America live

614
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,536
For master

615
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:46,560
To pull the

616
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,352
This one off I don't know how he does

617
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,656
The returns are not coming in favorable right now for

618
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,424
Republicans

619
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,448
And it

620
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,472
It's been shown that the

621
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,008
Incumbents did really well

622
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,056
There's a minute of Owen

623
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:59,872
Sort of covering the election results

624
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,920
Making it a conspiracy

625
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:05,248
Which I was surprised by what I'm hearing

626
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:10,880
It's it is what it is it's pretty much just kind of like here is that his numbers are coming in

627
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,440
I know what I'm here

628
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:17,536
You know like I know that I'm hearing Wolf Blitzer at the Boar

629
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,304
I'm

630
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,328
Frustrated

631
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,144
Wolf Blitzer isn't tied to the board to

632
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,168
Shirin 2

633
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:23,936
That it's

634
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,728
Elwyn doing this would happen

635
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,776
Think maybe that Owen

636
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,800
Kind of like

637
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,592
Experienced it

638
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:33,152
On midterm night

639
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:42,880
Let me let me give this another shot let me see if I can just say some information instead of

640
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:46,976
Some dumb b******* about Philadelphia County

641
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:50,816
Because I've got Alex giving me let's all come together

642
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:53,120
I do got Owen trying to be a journalist

643
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,400
This is busy

644
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,680
Is b*******

645
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,728
Does Dill say about the dumb s***

646
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:58,752
Yeah buddy

647
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,520
He's trying to be at

648
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,640
This was a three-headed monster

649
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,176
Sure if you will or a try

650
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,200
Act up

651
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,480
Of the new brand of

652
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,248
Conservative

653
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,296
The Fighter the one that takes on the media

654
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,088
The one that takes on the establishment

655
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,624
The one that's not afraid to back

656
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,392
Trump

657
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:20,768
And what we kind of weed

658
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:24,096
This could be a determining factor of what the

659
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,144
The future of the Republican Party looks like

660
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,448
If we have big wins in Arizona

661
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,240
This new breed of Republican

662
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,008
Didlake

663
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,032
And Masters

664
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,056
Olamide rep

665
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,872
Type of person to Republicans meiwah

666
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:36,896
Forward

667
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,920
Well they're not winning

668
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,688
Yeah

669
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:45,856
She's giving an assessment of your late did this was this new new idea this

670
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:49,184
These are our kind of candidates and they are all

671
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,256
We tried unqualified stupid a******

672
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:56,864
And we thought it was working really well there for a while but now it doesn't seem like it's working

673
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:03,264
Took the wrong message from 2020 maybe message was everything is stolen

674
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:10,176
Workout

675
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:14,528
Things Fall Apart

676
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,064
And in the run off with

677
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:16,832
Just be like

678
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,112
Gravy

679
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,392
For them if they

680
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,672
They can get that in Georgia

681
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,952
Sadly I kind of

682
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,232
In the Wind

683
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,512
This point I'm not

684
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,536
Not sure what the Republican

685
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,816
Plan is for Georgia

686
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,864
If they think going on get another abortion

687
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,144
Is the key

688
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,192
If they think going on Sean Hannity is

689
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:32,960
The key

690
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,240
Then they're going

691
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,008
Toulouse

692
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,544
.

693
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:37,568
That's it

694
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,336
End of sentence

695
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,640
They have no boots on the ground

696
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,920
They have no plan

697
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:44,480
Nothing from McConnell where is McConnell

698
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,248
By the way

699
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,528
Anybody heard from McConnell

700
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,808
These last couple days

701
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,344
No he's hiding in a hole

702
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,880
He's loving what he see

703
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,672
He wants to lose

704
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,440
The Senate

705
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:57,024
He want to lose Us in it so we can blame it on Donald Trump

706
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,584
Is number one

707
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:00,864
Initiative

708
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,400
From now

709
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,424
2024

710
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:04,704
He's to get

711
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,728
Trump

712
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,288
No matter what you the voter thing

713
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,360
This is what it's all about this is the new battle for the GOP

714
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,896
This is a good

715
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:13,664
Conspiracy

716
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,968
Yeah they really is it is not

717
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,272
Too far to be it's not like

718
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,040
You're not you're not

719
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,832
After being overly ambitious

720
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,904
You are obviously there is a ton

721
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,952
Understandable and believable problem

722
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,744
And that is that Mitch McConnell is

723
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,280
Pissed off about Trump

724
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,072
Basically taking over the GOP

725
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:33,888
Indeed so in order to resolve this

726
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,424
You take the midterms

727
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,520
I thought you blame it on Trump right and just like that

728
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:43,616
You're out of the woods into your safe quite that simple

729
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,200
But it but it in terms of a conspiracy that you're going to make

730
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,480
About losing the midterms

731
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:54,368
Pretty good but I mean as far as the conspiracy goes I don't even think that's a conspiracy theory so much as it is like

732
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,672
Okay I think this might be a

733
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,208
Fairly workable plan

734
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,232
That might work

735
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,512
You know I do

736
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:01,792
Macado's plans

737
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,072
Do for work

738
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,960
And I wouldn't put it past him to have a good plan I think that

739
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:13,056
It's staying the the majority leader is probably more important

740
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,080
Probably

741
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,616
But

742
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,896
B like it what year

743
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,432
You're saying is totally Act

744
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,712
Bigger is a

745
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:21,760
Like an A to B to C

746
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:24,576
The plan makes sense

747
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:28,416
You cannot mean it. I don't know if it works or works but it's

748
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:33,536
Things Fall Apart and stage 3 and magically everybody doesn't like

749
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:36,608
That part is going to be a little bit of a problem

750
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:43,008
Execution you can see that he's probably helping juice the media narrative go along and all that stuff but again

751
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,288
It's clearly

752
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,824
Getting yelled at by

753
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,944
The people that like Trump you know it's not like they he's he's tricked them into liking him more

754
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,064
It's just rare that you hear a conspiracy being thrown out by someone it in four words that like

755
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:02,464
Well at least has the grammar of a conspiracy

756
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,488
It is not

757
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,256
It's not

758
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,024
Out of

759
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,792
Resume

760
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:09,632
McConnell blocks out of

761
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,680
McConnell blocks the Supreme Court

762
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:18,592
You know like I said there's if there's a plan behind that it's not the clear like a 2B 2C like a fight

763
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,872
I do this then this will happen

764
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,920
We'll get Trump and then we'll fill that

765
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:22,688
Define late

766
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:25,760
There was always the possibility that Hillary was going to win

767
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:26,784
And they were going to have to

768
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,552
To fill it

769
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:33,696
He's the one who orchestrated that whole idea is a long shot

770
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:36,000
And giving him this is a long shot why not

771
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:36,768
You know

772
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,304
I don't know if it is

773
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,608
Happens this way at all

774
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:43,680
It's reasonable to think that he might have tried.

775
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,704
Hear me out okay

776
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,288
Alright I don't think that this is I don't think this happened I think

777
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,824
It's probably agree with you on that

778
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,592
Yes yes

779
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,360
Now

780
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:55,968
10 years from now if someone writes a book and it's a towel where Mitch McConnell says

781
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,296
I threw those midterms already get Trump out of my hair

782
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:05,952
I don't think I'd be that surprised that's what I'm saying I also don't think it happened I don't think there's any

783
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:06,976
I agree with that

784
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:07,744
20K

785
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,096
So anyway the Trump decide this thing is babe

786
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,400
You are absolutely right and that's why we

787
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,168
Cannot

788
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,192
Take the bait

789
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,496
I got to do this DeSantis versus Trump

790
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,544
Trump versus Sanders garbage in Trump

791
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,568
Really digging the baby

792
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:26,176
And I'm even care about Trump but your answer right we need to focus on the Republican leadership

793
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:29,248
Election fraud and on issues we've got

794
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,576
To get that talking point out our Millions delicious right now and viewers

795
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,600
Can do that f***

796
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,624
Don't take the bait

797
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,672
Tropicana's garbage

798
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,952
Stay on McConnell

799
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,976
Kevin McCarthy

800
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,000
We got to stay

801
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:42,048
Army's Alexis we got to stay on the issue

802
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,584
There is no bait

803
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,888
It's Trump being an a******

804
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,728
I don't know I mean that

805
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,032
The irony of course

806
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:52,800
Verses that

807
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,336
They have no

808
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,616
Governing

809
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,664
Ability policy

810
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,432
Ideas

811
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,224
Anything

812
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:06,624
No such issues are tough I can't believe they're all saying that like they haven't

813
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,696
Very clearly been removing anyone with ideas

814
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,744
As a matter of Prince

815
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,024
We have to stick

816
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,400
To the policy conversations policy

817
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:22,240
Lock her up the last time you heard of attack

818
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,520
Playing that was

819
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,848
Can I can I suggest

820
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,128
Lock her up

821
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:34,528
How about a 10% flat tax across those are issues are you talkin about 999

822
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:37,088
Herman Cain

823
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,368
So

824
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:41,696
You do the post-mortem here on the midterm

825
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:46,560
You're going to find a lot of places to place blame and Alex has an interesting one

826
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:50,656
Overconfidence

827
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:53,984
3D

828
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,288
But we know there was the same

829
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,824
Play Book of fraud

830
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,104
Battleground States

831
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,944
The Unexplained fallet Rob's

832
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,968
In Georgia and

833
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,016
Michigan

834
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,576
Pennsylvania and Nevada

835
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,600
Colorado

836
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,928
Is is real

837
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,720
Everything is the globalist

838
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:18,048
Even your feelings are just a result of the globalist

839
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,608
Tricking you into feeling that way

840
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,632
That's crazy

841
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:22,656
So I guess

842
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:26,496
The GOP overconfidence was part of why they didn't win the midterm

843
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:32,128
And that was caused by the globalist to the media or saying that the GOP was going to Wynwood

844
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,152
Ken's to stay home

845
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:33,920
And not vote

846
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,200
Which is stupid

847
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:38,784
I'm not sure that many of the voters Alex's talkin about

848
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,624
Take their voting cues from the mainstream media but an even bigger problem is that Alex was

849
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,928
Constantly talking about how the midterm was going to be over

850
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,720
Red tsunami in a bloodbath

851
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:52,096
If reporting that the GOP was going to win big is actually a psyop to lower GOP voting

852
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,120
Then Alex's meat

853
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,656
Guiltiest party of that

854
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:59,264
Also Alex is presented literally nothing to support his claims of voter fraud

855
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,288
And irregularity

856
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,104
This is just something you can assert with no evidence and it's

857
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,408
Accepted as proven by the audience at this point

858
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,688
They've been taught.

859
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:12,064
People that everything that they don't win has been stolen from them so no proof is necessary to defend this playing

860
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,368
That they feel as deeply true

861
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,136
Yeah

862
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,440
Yeah it is it is funny I was talking

863
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,208
Talking to

864
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,512
And I

865
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,280
There is

866
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:27,424
They're not election voter fraud like they're stealing election so much as they're like

867
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,984
Well I mean obviously they steal election

868
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,520
Everybody steals elec

869
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,544
Like there's no

870
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,568
Fair Alexa

871
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:37,152
Can you know if Democrats are stealing elections Republicans

872
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:39,712
There's never there's that there's an equilibrium

873
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:43,040
Simultaneous with the real one where do but he's doing

874
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:43,808
Voter fraud

875
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:44,576
They just

876
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,368
Moved it over 10

877
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,672
You know it's like it's like a switch

878
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:53,792
Weird Bizarro world

879
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:57,632
Dark Universe

880
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:03,264
But also everybody stole the same amount of votes that other people stole so it all kind of washes out

881
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:06,592
This isn't this isn't going to get better

882
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,384
AR we got to guess

883
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:12,736
May or may not have shown up on

884
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,272
Midterm Eve

885
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:20,672
I don't know cuz he was hanging out with Mike lindow

886
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:23,232
We still don't know who won the US Senate race

887
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,256
Nevada

888
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,816
We still we're going to a sudden death

889
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,584
Runoff

890
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,352
I think

891
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,888
In Georgia

892
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,424
Right now what I'd like to

893
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,704
Shane all honesty is

894
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:36,032
She's got 150 million dollars in his

895
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,312
Federal

896
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,616
She sending the Herschel Walker

897
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:42,688
Donald Trump has got tens of millions of dollars in his

898
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,712
Federal Pact

899
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:45,248
How much is he sending

900
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,368
Herschel Walker

901
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,904
We're hearing almost nothing

902
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,512
And meanwhile Raphael Warnock

903
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,048
Who's an extremely

904
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:01,632
The guy who ran over his wife

905
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,400
For the car

906
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,168
I'm sorry

907
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,960
Uses of Herschel Walker beam

908
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,240
Unbalanced

909
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,056
50 million

910
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:09,824
Dollars

911
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,176
Yeah that's just something to Rogers repeating from Attack ad put out by the Walker

912
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:14,944
Her campaign

913
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:20,064
They allege that in a fight during their divorce Warnock hit his now ex-wife with a

914
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:25,952
In reality she who claimed that he had run over her foot but there's a little bit of trouble with the story

915
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:29,792
Bruce Lee Warnock was the one who called the police to his ex-wife

916
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:32,864
Home to report that she had accused him of running over her foot

917
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:36,960
The police came and found that you was quote a reluctant to show her foot

918
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,984
To an officer

919
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,520
And the police report said that

920
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:45,152
I do not see any signs of Miss Aloha Foot was run over

921
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:51,040
Not able to locate any swelling redness or bruising or broken bones on the left foot

922
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:56,160
It's entirely possible that he could have run over her foot but not left any of those signs

923
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,720
It's not likely but it is possible it could happen

924
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:05,632
If this is what Rodger has to attack Warnock with compared to the very clear and verifiable dirt that walkers got

925
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,168
Going against him this dozen

926
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:07,936
Feel very

927
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:08,704
Compelling

928
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:14,592
I know that Rodger is an attack only kind of guy and he needs to use whatever ammunitions available to him but this

929
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,616
Feels pretty weak

930
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:19,200
Makes me feel like the Dems are probably going to hold onto Georgia

931
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,736
We'll see we will

932
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:21,760
Who knows

933
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,528
You know

934
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,808
It is it's like

935
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:24,832
What we

936
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,368
We saw that there is tons

937
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,672
Is of narratives but it feels like what we saw I was

938
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,208
Just old people and Young

939
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,232
People tied

940
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:36,352
You know but Rodger is the voice of the attacking old person does not feel very

941
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,632
Strong good

942
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,400
Yeah

943
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:40,704
So look here is where things

944
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,472
Spell Bart

945
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,752
When I was

946
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,032
Burbank

947
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:45,824
Hours

948
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,616
Perhaps what did Rodger

949
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:48,640
Well

950
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,176
It's more something Alex okay

951
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,480
Couple years ago

952
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,552
Oh no

953
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,600
It almost killed

954
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,648
It happened again

955
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,184
Going

956
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,512
A big event

957
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,048
Frank Speech TV

958
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,328
That's out

959
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,096
Crazy

960
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:09,888
This is getting

961
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,912
Rodger just

962
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,192
Keeps getting T-boned

963
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,496
The middle of nowhere

964
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,288
Rodger keeps getting T-Bone

965
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,104
So what about the polonium poisoning

966
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,128
If you are

967
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,664
Continually T-boned

968
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,688
In the middle of nowhere

969
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,224
That is a

970
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,576
And I could be wrong

971
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:29,600
I could be wrong

972
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,368
But

973
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,208
It seems more likely to be T-boned in an area where there are more cars

974
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,000
That's just math

975
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:36,768
In my head

976
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,864
Yeah maybe I don't know I wonder if it's my perception

977
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,912
I don't know this based on the Institute

978
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:49,312
But it's my perception that people are a little bit looser with driving drunk in the middle of nowhere

979
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:51,104
You been the case in my

980
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:57,503
Growing up in the middle of nowhere for my time in Central Missouri

981
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,783
Center of Allstate

982
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:03,903
Now that being said I also know a lot of people who drive drunk in Chicago

983
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:08,767
But they're also comedian so that is a fair at the confounding variable

984
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,535
Anyway

985
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:13,119
The car into accident that Rodger had in Florida

986
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:15,167
That was really weird one of the t-boning

987
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:20,031
This happened back in 2017 in the circumstances of that one we're really bizarre

988
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,103
Rodger was apparently in the car

989
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,407
In there was supposedly a hit-and-run

990
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:32,319
The police are called but for some reason they don't show up until 70 minutes later and when they get their Rogers nowhere

991
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:35,135
He apparently waited

992
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:37,951
30 minutes and got into Burr

993
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:42,047
Leaving the scene of his alleged assassination attempt

994
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:48,703
Take me out kind of thing

995
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:51,519
So he was just in another car accident in Memphis

996
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,543
That's her just outside my

997
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:55,359
Baptist this is what I've seen pictures of the car

998
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:58,175
Cuz they they posted the pictures it looks like a bad crash

999
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:03,039
I don't know if there's any evidence that it was done intentionally but that car was backed up

1000
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,063
Crash

1001
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,343
Itself happened in German

1002
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,111
Intown tennis

1003
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:11,999
And their police department has a Twitter account where they have the habit of giving people updates on things like traffic situation

1004
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,535
Instance

1005
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,839
On October 21st they tweeted quote

1006
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,119
Our officers are working

1007
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:21,215
A motor vehicle crash in the area of Poplar Avenue in Brockton Avenue

1008
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:22,751
Currently we have traffic

1009
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:25,055
Big shot down consider using an alternate route

1010
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,871
4 on September 9th they tweeted quote

1011
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:31,199
Car vehicle crash at Poplar and Germantown Road

1012
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,991
East travel lanes are blocked

1013
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,271
Please use an alternate route

1014
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:35,551
On November

1015
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:39,391
Right around when Rogers accident would have happened they tweeted quote

1016
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:45,791
Officers are on the scene of a crash where utility pole was struck and damaged on Wolf River Boulevard near river

1017
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,911
Westbound Lanes on Wolf River or being diverted causing delays in the area

1018
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:54,751
There's no other tweets about car accidents or traffic issues since

1019
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,031
October 24th

1020
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,335
I don't think this was Rodger

1021
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:03,199
Because I found another route news report about this accident the person driving the car was taken to the hospital

1022
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,223
But

1023
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:08,319
Here's how I ended up wasting so much time stood to know

1024
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,111
I saw a picture of the car

1025
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:14,207
Oh no I'm heading upward Angle now and I saw a bridge

1026
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:20,863
Oh my God you didn't geolocate did you I was trying to locate my God

1027
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:27,263
Everything all around so I can locate anything playing that one

1028
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:30,847
Game there probably was a better way I could have done this but

1029
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:34,431
Anyway I wasted a lot of time skills is just memorizing

1030
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,967
The world

1031
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,247
You should try that okay

1032
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:42,111
So the Germantown Police Department also has a Facebook page

1033
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,391
Is there more active on

1034
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:49,023
They have a Daily Post where they list the crimes that they responded to that day understand that

1035
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,583
Rogers accident occurred on either the 9th

1036
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,351
Or the 10th

1037
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:58,751
November I'm not entirely sure I believe it was the 9th. But there's also a story that would came out on

1038
00:44:59,007 --> 00:44:59,519
On the 11th

1039
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,079
Implies that it was yesterday

1040
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,103
So the 9th or the 10th

1041
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,895
Let's just say that in

1042
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:05,663
Proper

1043
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:06,687
Stone fashion

1044
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,455
The details

1045
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:08,479
Yes

1046
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:11,551
On the 9th police responded to a report of someone being a

1047
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:13,855
In possession of a stolen vehicle and quote

1048
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,391
An unknown suspect

1049
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,439
Started a small fire in a trash can

1050
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:20,255
That's a bad Night's Alright

1051
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,047
Then other for crimes

1052
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:22,815
On the tap

1053
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:26,655
Missing ham what was two people fighting

1054
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:31,775
Too involved reports of forged checks and the last one was botakin

1055
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:36,383
Complaint reporting the theft of a catalytic converter

1056
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,175
Conclusion I can come to after spending

1057
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:44,575
Way too much time on this is that if Rodger really believe that he been the target of like an assassination attempt

1058
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,855
By way of this car accident

1059
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,647
Strange they didn't call the police

1060
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:51,487
That is as the keeps a very suspect

1061
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:57,887
I'm it does not appear that they are called the police about this maybe even if it was just a hit-and-run or

1062
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:59,679
Even if it's just an accident

1063
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:01,215
You called the police

1064
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:04,287
To have the police report for your insurance claim or whatever

1065
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:06,335
I'm based on everything I can find

1066
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,639
About the Germantown Police Department

1067
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:13,247
Transparency and their social media that does not appear that

1068
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,015
Rodger called

1069
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:14,783
Interesting

1070
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,319
Yep the plot

1071
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:19,903
I mean it just comes a little bit murkier than usual

1072
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,695
It's still Rodger

1073
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:26,559
Could have been hit by stop by a polonium poisoning

1074
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,327
Driving a

1075
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:31,167
Sure like that's what it's come to no conclusions other than

1076
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,447
This is sucks

1077
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,727
Car is not

1078
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,263
In perfect shape

1079
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:36,543
That is what we can

1080
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,567
Can conclusively

1081
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,127
I will I will give Rodger credit because

1082
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,175
He doesn't think that this was an assassination

1083
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,455
I'm fine

1084
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,247
There's no reason to believe

1085
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,039
A political motive

1086
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,575
Guy wasn't wearing a black lives

1087
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,111
Matter t-shirt

1088
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:54,463
In find a copy.

1089
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,511
I was longer than that

1090
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,583
Another words

1091
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:03,423
Whatever struck the car didn't do so much damage to their own car

1092
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:05,983
Backup and pull away in the local

1093
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:06,751
Beliefs were

1094
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:07,519
Never able

1095
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,311
Identify who had done that

1096
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,847
So it remains

1097
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:11,871
Unsolved

1098
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:13,919
Weird

1099
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,711
So I applaud

1100
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,247
Rodger for not

1101
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,783
Thinking that this is a political hit

1102
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:24,671
Kind of shity that he kind of still thinks wanted 2017 was yeah but here's another problem with what

1103
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,695
What you just said

1104
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,719
She said

1105
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:28,255
This wasn't political end

1106
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:32,607
He's basing that on the person not wearing a black lives matter shirt

1107
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,911
Well I mean Beyond just being dumb

1108
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,959
Implies that he saw the driver

1109
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:39,263
Call the police

1110
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,031
He's with hole

1111
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:42,335
Information about a hit-and-run driver

1112
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,615
I don't know

1113
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:44,895
I will buy it

1114
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,687
I don't buy it either

1115
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,711
Just don't

1116
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:54,111
Might have hit a pole

1117
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,903
That's what makes sense to me

1118
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:57,951
That's just what I got

1119
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:01,791
It's infuriating it's not like I'm going to trust Rodger as a default

1120
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:02,815
Sure

1121
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,351
Lbry

1122
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:08,191
Some more analysis here and I think that this is

1123
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:08,959
Really sad

1124
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,263
I think you just is trying to struggle with

1125
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:13,055
The fact that there are more people in cities

1126
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:16,383
And they people in cities tend to be more liberal

1127
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,687
What the hell is going on in Atlanta

1128
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,991
What the hell is going on in Phoenix

1129
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:23,295
What the hell is going on in these major cities

1130
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,575
Chicago you name it

1131
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,343
We're Democrats

1132
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:28,159
Percent 80% sometimes in New York

1133
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:30,207
90% of the vote

1134
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,023
Address

1135
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,047
And try to mitigate

1136
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,727
With these margins

1137
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:42,495
Do they Trust

1138
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,263
The results

1139
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,031
Is that just because

1140
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:47,103
Abandoned

1141
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,663
Is it election fraud

1142
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,223
And so they never have a chance

1143
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,015
Enemies State elections

1144
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:56,319
They just get overwhelmed I mean New York is a

1145
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,391
If you take out New York City

1146
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,183
The state of New York is red

1147
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:04,255
Absolutely Owen Shroyer

1148
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:10,399
What a great Point disenfranchised the largest city in the United

1149
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:12,703
Fitness state is red

1150
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:16,031
It is it is absolutely not possible to consider

1151
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,311
That perhaps

1152
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,359
When large groups of

1153
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,639
Different different

1154
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,407
People

1155
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,687
Get together

1156
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:28,831
Recognize how very very very similar they are and live in the same Community together they don't think

1157
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,879
That is all black people's fault

1158
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:36,255
He had you lived in the middle of nowhere in a small town with nothing but white people

1159
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,815
It sure seems easy to say it's all black

1160
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:41,631
I feel like the messaging

1161
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,911
Especially the current

1162
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,191
GOP

1163
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:44,959
Love you

1164
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:47,519
Frenzy ice weirdos like Alex and Owen Wright

1165
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:49,567
They're messaging does not ring

1166
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:52,895
True to folks who live in cities and have broader life

1167
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,175
Experience

1168
00:49:54,687 --> 00:50:00,831
I'm and I do think that I wanted people in the GOP will have a difficult time

1169
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:02,879
I'm winning elections if they can

1170
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:04,159
Make any kind of an

1171
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:06,207
Appeal to people who live in cities

1172
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:10,815
And I think one of the things that they should think about changing the f****** message

1173
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:14,655
Instead it's all voter fraud why won't they investigate this

1174
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,423
You spent the last

1175
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:16,959
Computers

1176
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:20,799
Screaming about there's a people having investigations that go nowhere

1177
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:23,359
Come on man

1178
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,127
Yeah I mean

1179
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,175
Itzy it does seem silly

1180
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:29,503
If what it seems like is true

1181
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:31,295
That old people and young people tied

1182
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:34,623
I mean I wouldn't want to be on the side of old people

1183
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:35,647
For the future

1184
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:39,999
You know what I'm saying that's not a winning strategy if we're like let's choose the Dead one

1185
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:45,631
As time goes on it becomes worse and worse option

1186
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,655
New

1187
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,215
Of a guy

1188
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:50,751
He doesn't say who he is and

1189
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,799
The financial guy

1190
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:58,175
And I don't know I didn't look into who this person was either because it was just really clear that Alex

1191
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,711
Doesn't understand what he's saying

1192
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:01,503
And all this

1193
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:02,783
Actually matters for Nate

1194
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,319
As well

1195
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:05,599
Gandalf

1196
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:06,623
Again I want to

1197
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:08,159
Talk about value One More Time

1198
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,439
Because the southern

1199
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,207
Part of the world

1200
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:11,999
Has value

1201
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,559
Are greater than large

1202
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:15,583
Elements of the northern

1203
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:16,863
And we start

1204
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,143
About

1205
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,191
On water

1206
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:21,215
Intrigued

1207
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:23,007
I'm biodiversity

1208
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,287
Refined

1209
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,055
Where does that say

1210
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:28,639
I'm doing a lot of work out of Asia and I say that my next door neighbor

1211
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,943
Indonesia is the left lung of the world

1212
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,991
And obviously Brazil's a right

1213
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,271
And Africa

1214
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,039
Absolutely

1215
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:35,807
Critical

1216
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:37,343
And we need there

1217
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,111
Natural

1218
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:39,903
As a

1219
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:40,927
Some based

1220
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:42,719
World more than we need

1221
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:43,743
That 66

1222
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:44,511
Billiard weave

1223
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:46,303
Got sitting in the basement of the bank of England

1224
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:48,095
So how do we and I'm hoping this

1225
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:50,399
Discussion today at least from a central Banker

1226
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,167
Point of view

1227
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:52,447
And how do we start

1228
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:54,239
Tokenizing how do we start

1229
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:55,519
System

1230
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,799
That actually create

1231
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,823
Down the volume

1232
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:58,591
Transfer that

1233
00:51:58,847 --> 00:51:59,871
Value around the world

1234
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,151
Oh yes

1235
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:03,199
Elder transferring my the third world

1236
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:03,967
I control

1237
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:04,991
Liana World Bank

1238
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:05,759
Wow

1239
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:07,807
Wei Ramen

1240
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:11,135
Animals they vote for them you don't have a vote anymore

1241
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:13,951
Admitted plan

1242
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:18,815
Really bizarre he does not have comprehension skills like really basic

1243
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,095
Comprehension

1244
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:25,983
Yeah yeah what crazy is that that's actually a really terrifying things to hear a central Banker say

1245
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:32,639
You know I felt the scary thing but he just said and Alex's like all the IMF I think it's

1246
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:38,015
Depends on exactly what the intentions are because there's a way to hear that

1247
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:40,575
That has more of ascent

1248
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:41,855
That

1249
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:42,879
The things

1250
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:43,647
Is like

1251
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:44,671
These rainforest

1252
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:45,695
Kristen Brazil

1253
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,231
Yeah they have

1254
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,511
A value

1255
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,279
That is

1256
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:50,047
Is greater

1257
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:51,583
To the system of the world

1258
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:56,447
Then anything that we can really put a monetary value on like in a logging industry or

1259
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,727
Whatever

1260
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:00,287
Forces are there that are concrete

1261
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:02,591
That would lead to deforestation

1262
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:03,615
It's so

1263
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,383
System

1264
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:05,919
I should be

1265
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:07,199
Conceived of

1266
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:10,783
That allows for the tokenization of these beings

1267
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,063
Existing

1268
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,343
Right you know right

1269
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,647
And I do think it's kind of scary

1270
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,439
But at the same time

1271
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:19,487
It's

1272
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:20,511
Claimed

1273
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,279
Closer

1274
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,303
To conservation

1275
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:26,399
Right here's a mountain in a similar way to Rodger

1276
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:29,215
And my default is not going to be believed

1277
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,239
Right

1278
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:32,031
A central Banker

1279
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:35,615
A central Banker talking about natural resources

1280
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:36,895
Is the most

1281
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,431
Terrifying thing that can happen

1282
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,223
That's in my head

1283
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:43,295
Because their Winn-Dixie when you say tokenized

1284
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:45,343
What I'm hearing from them is

1285
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,367
Okay

1286
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,391
Alright

1287
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:49,695
We've been owning this the wrong way

1288
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:51,487
We've been strip-mining

1289
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:54,303
What we need to do with own it the right way

1290
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:57,887
And gross stuff that we own

1291
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:01,471
I can I can see I can see why

1292
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,751
Back

1293
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,287
Impression comes to mind

1294
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:09,407
And I'm not saying that's not what he was saying I think that there are ways to look at

1295
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:12,735
Like the implications of what

1296
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:15,295
So that kind of very

1297
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:16,831
Agree on what he's saying

1298
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:20,671
Yes and that is different than what Alex Alex has her.

1299
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:21,695
Idea what he said

1300
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:25,791
He just thinks that all we're going to take all the money from the bank of England and give it to the side

1301
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:26,559
Weigh-off

1302
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:30,655
So you just heard the bank of England I say where the transfer all the wealth

1303
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:31,679
Out of the North

1304
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:37,055
Control take your money and enslave them

1305
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:40,383
And now by bumbling around

1306
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,151
At the new

1307
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:45,247
Paris agreement 2.0

1308
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:46,783
Promising all this

1309
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,319
For our wealth to the global

1310
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,879
Lockdown for years

1311
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:52,159
Yeah it's just

1312
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,695
Stop to

1313
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:54,719
Here

1314
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:56,255
Kamban think like

1315
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:57,535
People take this

1316
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:00,351
He has just basic

1317
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,887
Inability to

1318
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,167
Heatkeep respond

1319
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:04,447
Cool two things

1320
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,471
He does

1321
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:08,031
And that's kind of trouble

1322
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:11,359
Yeah I mean a lot of the times you can see him

1323
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,639
Get enough of it

1324
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:15,455
I'm being emotional enough about

1325
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,223
The right

1326
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:17,247
Part of it that you can

1327
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:19,295
Can kind of skip over that he doesn't understand most of it

1328
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:25,695
Right in this regard I mean I I can't see anybody

1329
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:30,047
He who knows less about what they're talkin about flounder more trying to look

1330
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:31,071
Like they know what they're talking

1331
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:36,703
Yeah it's terrible I mean if you listen to as much of it as I do so I can hear that a lot more

1332
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:40,031
Points not always talk about

1333
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:42,079
Maybe I just needed to find something

1334
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:44,127
To fill in this episode because

1335
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:46,175
This is maybe shorter

1336
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,455
For a couple reasons

1337
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,223
First

1338
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:49,759
My side attempt

1339
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:53,087
The geo-locating a bridge

1340
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:59,743
I thought it was so fun if I could coming by.

1341
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:02,559
They would have been a great risk like blocking a Supreme Court Justice

1342
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:05,887
Yeah it doesn't always play and play out in your favor

1343
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:08,191
And whatever and the second reason is this

1344
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:13,311
Have the sensors trying to silence us cat McGinnis

1345
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:16,383
Is our guest with a bouncy hour to talk about the midterms

1346
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,199
Between

1347
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:20,735
Trump and DeSantis

1348
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:24,575
Open borders

1349
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:27,903
And Ukraine the insanity going on

1350
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,719
He is the house

1351
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,279
TV

1352
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,559
The founder of Vice

1353
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,351
And so much more needs introduction

1354
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:39,167
Gavin thank you so much for being on with my friend

1355
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:41,727
We didn't talk before you came on I threw out kind of a

1356
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:43,519
Plethora of things to Hitman

1357
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,311
What's Rent-A-Center for you my friend

1358
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:48,127
A new phenomenon I'm calling

1359
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:49,407
Terrorism

1360
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:51,711
It's tearing from a chair

1361
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:54,783
I had a show in Rutherford New Jersey last night

1362
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:57,087
And antifa found out about it

1363
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,879
They just terrorized

1364
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:00,159
Thumbs

1365
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:02,207
The venue owner

1366
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:03,231
The chief of police

1367
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:03,999
The mayor

1368
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:05,279
And

1369
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,303
To show up

1370
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,583
Left her chair for any of this

1371
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:08,863
The mayor got

1372
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,655
Spooked he called the chief of police

1373
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:12,959
Who told the venue to shut it down

1374
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:14,239
And they did

1375
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,263
What's

1376
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:19,359
First and foremost on Gavin McInnes his mind is as yet a show cat

1377
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:21,151
Yeah the midterms

1378
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,943
I mean I had five

1379
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,223
All of these important

1380
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,247
World events

1381
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:27,295
We got to get into all of them but first

1382
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:28,575
I had a show camp

1383
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:30,623
Most importantly

1384
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:32,415
Let's think about the true victim

1385
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:36,255
Okay which is of course then you had a to drink

1386
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:39,839
Oh my gosh they lost a lot on that okay

1387
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:40,863
That's bulshit

1388
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,911
Unthinkable genuinely thought he was

1389
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:49,311
Who's in jail I thought for some reason like a couple months ago what happened

1390
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:55,711
Why would I pay attention past it's fun that you didn't

1391
00:57:55,967 --> 00:58:01,343
Because the reason that it came out that he faked it was because Owen Benjamin who is

1392
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:05,951
Of course before swelling Nazi used to host the fourth hour for Alex

1393
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,231
He

1394
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:11,327
Leaked texts between himself and Gavin twitch

1395
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,863
I mean it speaks

1396
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:17,215
To the fact that him and Gavin are still on friendly terms you know he's a forest dweller

1397
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:19,519
Yeah okay

1398
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:23,359
He

1399
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,639
A couple months back

1400
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:26,943
On his show he faked like a raise

1401
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:31,039
Yeah and then disappeared in the middle of the show and it was all just like

1402
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:33,343
Oh my God he was faking getting arrested

1403
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,135
He still touring as a cop

1404
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:39,231
Yeah he had a couple of shows canceled one was like him and Alex

1405
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:40,255
Steinbeck

1406
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:44,351
Troll guy

1407
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:46,655
Yeah the two of them are apparently doing some like Duke

1408
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:48,959
Wow

1409
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,519
Can't believe it

1410
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:52,543
Not good

1411
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:56,895
Spending a lot of time trying to geolocate Rogers

1412
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:59,711
Car and then Gavin McGinnis being on the show

1413
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:00,479
What's a real bummer

1414
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:01,759
Kind of makes it so like

1415
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,807
I don't know we have

1416
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:05,343
I have clips that I caught

1417
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,623
Gavin

1418
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,951
Talkin and as I'm sitting here

1419
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,255
He just says offensive things

1420
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:14,559
Trying to bait reaction

1421
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:20,191
Any of his analysis or the things that he says are worthwhile like

1422
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:23,007
A hit 120 says that his prediction is that Biden

1423
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:26,335
Is going to beat Trump in 2024 because women are too emotional

1424
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:29,151
Like I don't know

1425
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:30,175
What what's the point

1426
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,711
Here's a what

1427
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:33,247
Hearing okay

1428
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,039
His show should have been

1429
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:35,807
Canceled

1430
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:36,831
Because he

1431
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:39,391
He thought that terrorist was funny

1432
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:40,927
And that means

1433
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:45,535
That the shows are. That's your opener but terrorism

1434
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,303
Strong

1435
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:50,143
Wow is that bad and he came out with it like this is

1436
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:50,911
Is my this is

1437
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:51,935
B

1438
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:53,727
Get in there

1439
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:56,543
I'm trying to see if there's anything even if these clips

1440
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:59,103
It's worth talking about and I don't think there is

1441
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,895
Although I was sad to see him up

1442
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:01,663
Pure

1443
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:04,223
I don't I don't know what

1444
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:07,295
I don't I don't know why

1445
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,063
Yuri

1446
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:13,183
I thought he was a thing of the past

1447
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:15,743
By everybody and we just moved on from him

1448
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:17,279
Existing well I mean

1449
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:21,631
That never really happens with Infowars comes back

1450
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:24,447
Constantly

1451
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,471
He's always around

1452
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:27,519
Now I'm I guess I wouldn't really be

1453
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:28,287
Like

1454
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:32,639
Gavin belongs in that part of my brain with Mike cernovich inject

1455
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:33,663
Sobec

1456
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:34,943
These people that like

1457
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,479
I don't really see

1458
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:38,527
I guess Jack Pacific was on not too long ago

1459
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:42,111
Cernovich I don't think has been on Infowars in a long time

1460
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,647
Lauren Southern

1461
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:45,439
These kinds of people who like

1462
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,975
I've been on in this Lake

1463
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:49,791
Other.

1464
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:50,815
Premium download

1465
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:52,095
Feel-Rite

1466
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:52,863
Yeah

1467
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:53,887
But it's enough

1468
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:58,751
His role is supposed to be like during 2016 he says offensive stuff tonight

1469
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:03,359
Fun on this show trolling the libs are eventive stuff

1470
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,407
Kind of tired now

1471
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:09,247
Bad I don't know if I like his shows getting cancelled now that I know that he

1472
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,015
The comic

1473
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:13,087
Cuz I kind of want him and people don't know though

1474
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,111
Isaac

1475
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:14,879
Bye

1476
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,159
Is that

1477
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:16,927
Well yes

1478
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:18,975
Canceling his shows might hit his wallet

1479
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:20,511
And all of that stuff real bad

1480
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:25,887
I think it would really hurt him though is to live through a lot of those shows that I've lived through

1481
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:29,727
Where you got 15 people who showed up and 12 of moron free ticket

1482
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:32,543
No I don't think so because he has a

1483
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:33,311
Gang

1484
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:34,591
Oh no

1485
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:36,127
The proud boys

1486
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:39,199
That's right they all f****** love him yeah

1487
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:41,503
And also it might not hurt his wallet so much

1488
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:45,343
Because he claims that he's going to sue the city of Rutherford New Jersey good luck

1489
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:49,183
Just have fun at their headquarters

1490
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,999
With like a boombox

1491
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:53,791
And I Allie Alexander

1492
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:54,815
Hanging out with him

1493
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:57,887
Everything is cool

1494
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:00,959
Bad guy

1495
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:01,727
Hatem

1496
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:03,775
Hitam anyway

1497
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:10,175
So this is going to be a shorter

1498
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:12,479
They don't have to sit through 20 minutes of us being like

1499
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:13,503
Gavin McInnes

1500
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:14,271
Not funny

1501
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:17,855
Yeah I don't really have much commentary about him other than his position suck

1502
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:22,207
And I think he's just saying awful things in order to get a rise out of people

1503
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:24,255
Alex has a new story

1504
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,023
Cover

1505
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:27,071
Monticello

1506
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:28,607
Footage

1507
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:30,143
A

1508
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:32,447
Shop teacher

1509
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:33,727
Wearing

1510
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,263
Giants

1511
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,287
Brass

1512
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:39,103
Asian bizarre behavior

1513
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,127
In Ontario

1514
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:45,247
School board rules to allow male teacher

1515
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:47,039
4 giant prosthetic bras

1516
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:48,575
It's meant to make

1517
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:49,343
A whole system

1518
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,111
Joke

1519
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:52,159
Be clear about something

1520
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:58,559
I don't know enough about that whole story when it happened I just saw people I don't care about complaining about

1521
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:04,959
So I decided to sit I don't know what the circumstances of his teacher RI

1522
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:05,983
Anythink

1523
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:07,775
By Alex is lying

1524
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:14,431
The school board reviewed their standards to see if there was anything that they could do in terms of imposing a dress code and found that he could

1525
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:18,783
Could raise human rights concerns and also have implications in terms of Labor rights

1526
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,319
And employment law

1527
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:21,855
But the board didn't

1528
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:23,647
Make any position or change on this

1529
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:24,927
Because they can't right now

1530
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:30,047
The superintendent of human resources for the school board sorry Taha said quote

1531
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:33,375
Even if we are to consider a workplace rules in that sense

1532
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,399
We can't do that

1533
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,959
This is because they're currently in the middle of collect

1534
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:41,823
The bargaining and the board isn't permitted to make rule changes in the middle of that process right

1535
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:46,431
It's right say make a good point though that even a good faith rule about dress code or grooming

1536
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,455
Standards could

1537
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:50,271
Easily end up being applied and discriminatory fashion

1538
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:52,575
But the larger point is that their intellect

1539
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:54,879
So they can't even consider Rule King

1540
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:59,743
It's probably just a headline like the one in the National Post that says quote

1541
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:00,511
School Board

1542
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:04,607
Concluded can't Implement dress code after teacher wears giant fake breasts

1543
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:11,263
And then he wrote his own story about it without looking into it any further and realizing that the reason that the headline says that they

1544
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:13,311
They concluded they can't Implement a dress code is

1545
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:14,847
Because every collective bargaining

1546
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:18,431
There is a decent chance that they might not even if they weren't

1547
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,711
Yeah no I mean

1548
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:20,735
The reason they can't

1549
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:25,087
Is because I can't write they physically in the universe we inhabit

1550
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,879
They can't make a

1551
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:28,927
Anyway

1552
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:34,047
I lied there's a third reason that this episode shower another gas

1553
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:40,191
City of the balance book

1554
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:43,007
Bacelar presidential takedown

1555
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:47,615
And also talked about the midterms what we're witnessing attorney science teacher

1556
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:50,431
And two-time New York Times best seller he's best known as

1557
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:52,991
Author of The Pledge series plague flag

1558
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:55,295
Corruption and ending play with.

1559
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,623
It just goes on from there

1560
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:02,463
We really appreciate him coming on with us today and

1561
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:04,511
He didn't want to talk about this morning. About it

1562
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:11,423
Cut it down a lot more books on it

1563
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:12,191
But you really

1564
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:15,263
Help me write the great reset

1565
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:17,055
We've been off and on the number one

1566
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:17,823
I bet

1567
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:20,127
Showers bended I saw that they were times ignored that

1568
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:21,151
Find a bug

1569
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:22,687
Store.com

1570
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:23,967
Congratulations

1571
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:24,991
Good to meet you in

1572
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:27,551
Personnel afford having on many times

1573
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:33,183
I applaud Alex for giving a full disclosure on that again but yeah he's the guy who wrote Alex's book

1574
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:35,999
He's just a big old anti-vaxxer

1575
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:39,327
So he has

1576
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:40,863
Large

1577
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:42,911
Stretch of his career writing books

1578
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:44,447
With Judy mikovich

1579
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:46,239
The person who is behind plandemic

1580
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:48,287
Best documentary quote on quote

1581
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:52,127
And so he has a long career

1582
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:54,175
As a big-time anti-vaxxer

1583
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:58,783
Tom and in 2017 he ended up being denied entry into Australia

1584
01:05:59,039 --> 01:05:59,807
Because of it

1585
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:04,671
Because they he was just going to do a bunch of anti-vax rally rally like no

1586
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:11,583
At that point he had Brandon himself quote the world's number-one anti-vaxxer

1587
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:12,863
I'm so

1588
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:18,751
Kind of gets rid of the the arguments to do was trying to make when he was denied entry into Australia's he was like

1589
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:22,335
Raising concerns and asking questions and stuff

1590
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:23,615
And also

1591
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,919
When he was told you

1592
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:26,687
Couldn't come

1593
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:30,527
He sent a letter to the Australian government that was

1594
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:31,807
Taunting Malcolm

1595
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:34,367
Turn Bolt the the prime minister

1596
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:35,391
Here's a passage from the

1597
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:36,415
Love it

1598
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:40,255
If you wish to greet me at the airport when I land I would be amenable to such a

1599
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:45,631
An effort or if you think our meeting should be at the lodge the primary residence of the Prime Minister I would

1600
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:46,655
Except that as well

1601
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:49,215
After all I will be a guest in your country

1602
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:55,871
Please don't make too much of a fuss over my efforts but if you would like to give me an award in recognition of my work deliberate Austria

1603
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:56,639
Really from the grip of

1604
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,919
The pharmaceutical industry

1605
01:06:58,175 --> 01:07:02,015
I like the sound of the order of Australia officer of the order

1606
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:05,343
Maybe it's the imperialist in me but it just sounds so Regal

1607
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:08,159
Yeah I can't I can't

1608
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:11,999
I like talkingshit to governments to I can't argue with that

1609
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:13,535

You know you're just

1613
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:28,639
Poking your thumb in the eye of government you know

1614

Maybe some like idea thing though I mean he put it

01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,039
It's fingerprints on there because

1625
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:09,087
Confirms that he wrote Abraham like

1626
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:10,879
Chocolate sauce

Assigning the cookies with Hershey syrup

Yeah Alex Goodman some of the syntax and if there's like there's no way that Alex

01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:24,703
Alex doesn't know about whom

01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:31,103
Doesn't know about like a dependent clause in a note

1632
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:36,735
In apostrophe D at the end of this year

01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,015
Will be born from that

1648
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,295
Berryville tree

1649
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:14,111
I want to give a little bit of a

1650
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:14,879
Short

1651
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:15,903
Synopsis

1652
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:17,439
It sucks

1653
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:18,975
The bad book

1654
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:19,743
Bad book

1655
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:22,559
Hickenlooper did a terrible job

1656
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:24,863
No not a good I don't even think this is right

1657
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,167
The name it can't he can live like that

1658
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:28,959
Kent heckenlively

1659
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:30,239
Did a bad job

1660
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:31,519
Also

1661
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:32,799
I don't think

1662
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:34,079
He wanted

1663
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:35,359
People to know the

1664
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:36,895
That he wrote the book make

1665
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:40,991
Or something because he's not acknowledged in any way until the back

1666
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:41,759
Back of the book

1667
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:43,295
Thank you

1668
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:49,439
It's not that it doesn't say it on the spine Alex and it doesn't take ghostwritten by nope

1669
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:52,255
In the acknowledgments at the beginning there's no like

1670
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:53,791
Nothing

1671
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:56,863
Yeah either he didn't want to have credit

1672
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:57,887
Or

1673
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:59,679
Alex wanted to have all of

1674
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:03,519
Yeah Alex wanted most of it to look like a

1675
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:05,311
Why did he bring it up

1676
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:08,639
When Kent City

1677
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:10,687
Talk about that

1678
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:12,991
Asian Cajun

1679
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:14,271
Why is it going on the shop

1680
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:19,903
Although he's going on this is another Patrol shows several weeks after that

1681
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:23,487
The heat on Alex's book is

1682
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:27,327
He would have if he wanted to be part of the book you have been part of

1683
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:33,727
Heat part right he has another book that he's promoting he's on the show

1684
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:36,031
On the show because you did Alex asalatu wrote his book for

1685
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:41,919
Otherwise I don't think this guy is the world's number one

1686
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:43,455
Exer

1687
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:47,295
If I never met him in person from what I can understand

1688
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:48,319
I am

1689
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:49,087
I'm seeing that

1690
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:50,623
He was a far thinker

1691
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:52,927
And said sure I'll write your shity book

1692
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:55,999
So that I can always promote my books later on

1693
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,279
Yeah

1694
01:10:58,303 --> 01:11:00,351
Pretty clear that your audience

1695
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:01,887
Would be into the kind of

1696
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:03,935
Direct that I put out

1697
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,007
Stuff

1698
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,543
Good stuff all around

1699
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:10,847
I did look responding to the midterms

1700
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:12,127
Quite well

1701
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:12,895
Yeah they're taking

1702
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:16,479
Oh oh so I forgot to mention this

1703
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:20,063

1704
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,599
Great Awakening books

1705
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:24,927
Might be a little signal to qanon

1706
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:29,023
They also sell barbecue in on books

1707
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:29,791
The part in

1708
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:32,095
In the great reset because and I respected

1709
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:33,887
For it alright in this one

1710
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:36,703
Unlike certain adaptations

1711
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:38,751
They left Tom Bombadil in

1712
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:45,151
And that's what you want out of it you know Glenn Beck took it out to come out

1713
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:46,943
Have that in your book if you don't I'm pissed

1714
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:47,967
Right frankly

1715
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:49,503
I take it up with the blaze

1716
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:52,831
So anyway we come to the end of this stand

1717
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:54,879
