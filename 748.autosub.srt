00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
Need

00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,552
Knowledge fight

00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,320
Acknowledge

00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Dot-com

7
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,792
The altar of spleen.

00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,328
Alex golden

9
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:10,912
Windy we are Danny Jordan

10
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,936
Euphoria

11
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:16,032
Today Jordan is I don't know if

12
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:19,360
It's because winter is upon us it went from

13
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:22,176
7230 in a week

14
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:27,296
Religion of Italy was like 70 degrees last Wednesday

15
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,064
Baby was

16
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,136
It was on seasonably warm that day

17
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,416
40 degrees

18
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,208
Anyway I've been a little down

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,120
Do you have been mental health of days people will

20
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,704
Do you wrestle with

21
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:48,544
Some precious metal happen

22
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,824
Do do you have sometime today is

23
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,872
Things that I have done

24
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,408
Traditionally

25
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,944
I need to make a

26
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,248
I need to make some kind of a change

27
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,784
In order to

28
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,320
Myself out of the funk

29
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:02,112
A little bit you know sometimes

30
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,208
I meant I wanted one of my old habits was a shave my head

31
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:11,584
And I decided maybe that those days should be behind me

32
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,608
And I should get haircuts

33
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:19,520
And probably wise good with her hair for your age my man you got a

34
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,056
You got a rocket while you can

35
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:23,104
Yeah but so I decided

36
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,640
Sure

37
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:31,040
And so I got a back shaver naturally I have never shaved my

38
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:34,624
My back before in my 38 years of life

39
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,952
Here's the thing

40
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:41,536
I thought it would be super easy with one of those arms

41
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:45,376
The things those long razors that you can put behind your back

42
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:49,984
Why would you think it would be easy because it's a tool

43
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:56,384
It's like we have got this tool because we've made it this far at some point someone should have met

44
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,784
Play daytime easy-to-use vaccinate figured they had it covered

45
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,064
It's hard to shave your back

46
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,160
We have constructed a problem in order to make it easy we have

47
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,184
Got this weird thing

48
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,584
No it is not easy I don't like I did a good job at the only result

49
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,984
Experience because of it is it feels a little bit different and weird when I put a shirt on

50
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,104
Hey new experiences right now I'm struggling

51
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,128
That you know of

52
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:34,528
Obviously I love you you're my best friend you're my partner I really don't know if I've got it in me to shave your back for you

53
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,064
I just don't know I didn't ask

54
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,160
I know you didn't ask if that's why I'm saying this up front so we don't get into any aqua

55
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,208
Awkward situation preciate

56
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,792
I did take it anyway

57
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:49,120
I did a little late you know I did a little work on it and ran like

58
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:55,520
A couple hours later maybe I came back in a little bit

59
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,056
But anyway

60
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:03,456
I don't know I don't know what I'm going to do is probably because I shaved my arm

61
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:09,856
Arms in anticipation of getting that tattoo right that I didn't end up getting kicked off

62
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:17,280
I am so now I know my first my first like piece I got my entire like upper thigh

63
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,327
Whole thing done

64
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,863
And they shave the whole thing

65
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,911
Swear to God for another year at

66
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,215
Just kept shaving and it felt really good to me

67
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:31,615
Smooth I just kept on going I was like why stop now he knows it from like when I have shaved my head being in the shower and water

68
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,431
Hitting your bald head really great

69
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,711
Like there's something to that

70
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,527
Bi we'll see we'll see what happens

71
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,295
Anyway

72
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,087
I feel a little better

73
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,647
How about you

74
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:49,279
My bright spot is my wonderful my part my perfect wife she had

75
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,863
Both her covid booster and her flu booster yesterday

76
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,423
So this is a break for flu B

77
00:04:55,679 --> 00:05:00,799
Yeah that functions as a psa2 everybody get your booster shots and all that stuff

78
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:07,199
I hear this season's flu is quite bad both from the CDC and anecdotally from

79
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:13,599
I would second that

80
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:18,207
Well I am happy for her luckily I am immune to all infectious

81
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,999
Diseases so I don't have to worry about it

82
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:26,399
It's nice that is one of the advantages

83
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:30,239
I had sort of prepared that we were going to

84
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,263
You know maybe go

85
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,055
Repast

86
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,591
Things are real boring

87
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:39,967
In 2003 I'm going to skip ahead for our next

88
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,503
It's time we go back to the past but

89
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,039
Unfortunately report back to

90
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:43,807
The present

91
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,831
Very important

92
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,111
That is the Trump announce

93
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,487
Yeah I took today we will be talking about

94
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:54,559
The aftermath of this on November

95
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,351
16th 2022

96
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,399
See how Alec wrestles with

97
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:05,055
The reality that he's going to have to make a choice

98
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:10,175
A huge Groundswell of excitement from what I'm hearing

99
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:10,943
Everyone

100
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:15,551
Apparently heard this and God God he's just trying to get out of jail

101
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,575
Weather

102
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:20,671
We did this dance already

103
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:24,767
Some people are saying God God God

104
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,583
But Alex is going to get down to

105
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,399
Really the the the nuts and bolts of it

106
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,423
He's going to talk about

107
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,447
His feelings

108
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,495
About this announcement

109
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,823
Play all the relevant coverage in the footage

110
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,359
Trump Trump's announcement

111
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,783
Do 1st June who got one

112
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,135
So it'd be wild if they didn't pick up a policy wonk at some point

113
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:57,023
I'm a policy wonk very much I got to say this brings up an important point and that is I think that

114
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,327
At least one of these other b y button

115
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,887
Might have got lost in the mail

116
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:05,471
How you may need to make some more because

117
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:12,127
I know that one has an out and I haven't heard back from anybody that it arrived

118
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,199
Just went out so there may actually

119
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,991
I think I might bump it up to 5

120
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:23,391
Okay I think that's what I might do all right I don't know I got to figure this out because it's really unsatisfied Stampy special

121
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,207

You're not a policy wonk

135
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,735
Next

136
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,039
We have a technocrat Jordan

137
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:29,439
This is it this is a fairly special London old old buddy of mine's

138
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,231
Dirty Laundry truck secrets are buried

139
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:31,999
You're now a tech

00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,887
Start don't get mad until you're brilliant someone

141
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,911
Sodomites

142
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,687
I don't want

143
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:54,271
Jesus Christ old old buddy of mine

144
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,087
One of his nicknames would actually dachshund

145
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:02,463
It also goes by sweet butter

146
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:06,303
Is sweet butter on the streets

147
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,839
Sweet butter on the

148
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,631
Okay

149
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:16,031
He was one of the four people who lived in a house they were all year older than me will work

150
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,055
Movie theater together

151
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,103
And they lived at this house

152
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:23,967
I dropped out of high school until I was just over at their house all the time getting drunk

153
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,759
I haven't having a blast

154
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,575
Freedom in the irresponsible way

155
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:34,207
One day I don't know exactly what it was it might have been a party we had over the house it might have just been

156
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37,023
Another night of me Chuck and booze

157
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,047
But iPad

158
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,351
Passed out on the front lawn and

159
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:44,703
I guess because it's a residential neighborhood and people didn't want for them

160
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,983
Frowned upon

161
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:50,335
Generally speaking

162
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,687
Lower property values

163
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:58,527
You can do it in one night in my favorite property value were

164
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,831
Looks by while your other The Lawns

165
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:07,231
Lehman everybody loses the grand on their value so I wake up the next morning

166
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,255
Unin on Direct

167
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,071
To someone kicking me

168
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:15,167
And a car horn honking and open up the tarp and it

169
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:21,311
So Mike has little brother

170
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,639
Antebellum that was not my finest hour

171
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,223
Anyway thank you sweet butter

172
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:36,159
Infused if you do see a man underneath the tarp your first thought is that body right your first thought is dead body

173
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:39,487
And that raises a lot of a lot more property valuation

174
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,279
What's the buy my bike has little brother

175
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,143
That's not a terrible idea if you were dead body

176
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,935
Not respectful

177
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:52,287
That's fair anyway we start here on the 6th

178
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,847
Steve and Alex

179
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,127
Straight into the Trump

180
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,407
Because there is other

181
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:00,991
Broadcast

182
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
Today

183
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,599
I told you probably

184
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,951
Show

185
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,719
Research

186
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,791
Shut up

187
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:21,471
So Alex is obsessed with bragging about how he had a knee-jerk announced

188
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,519
Vet the

189
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,055
Missile that had hit

190
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,079
Poland

191
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:29,407
Was probably a surface-to-air missile

192
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,943
Defense from Ukraine

193
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:34,271
Right now the signs are pointing to that being the case

194
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:40,671
And so you got something right accidentally and he is so excited right by virtue of knee-jerk.

195
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,743
Defending anything rush it does he may have inadvertently

196
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,047
Translate you got it right until you play with

197
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,327
The clip of himself

198
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,607
Saying this

199
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:55,007
On a previous show of course he does over and over again

200
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,287
Leaving the show okay

201
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,079
It was right if I was

202
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,383
Potentially right about topic

203
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,455
This is exactly like if he was in his office

204
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,479
Any like just

205
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:08,575
Threw a ball of paper all the way across into a into a garbage can

206
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,391
And nobody saw it but it was recorded so he's like I'm just

207
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,671
I'm going to play this over

208
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,695
You guys see this

209
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:20,095
I nailed it right in the Gazette right in the bed good job good job

210
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,703
Is Rodger Stone on a plate

211
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:28,543
Turbo Clips early go to Rodger this is Trump last night making them in an ounce

212
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,311
Running is running

213
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,103
2024 we told you

214
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
Months ago that

215
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,919
He had told people very close

216
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:36,991
The show

217
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,527
He was running

218
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,391
Today yet again you're not Vindicated

219
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:49,791
You said you was going to do it on the 4th of July to bility was roughly five months ago right

220
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:54,143
I mean like that's not fair it's not fair

221
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,703
Negative

222
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,519
I think just about anybody

223
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,311
Like

224
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,895
Could have ended predict Trump was going to run again

225
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:12,319
I think I think that's not like though the wildest tomorrow's news today kind of s***

226
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:16,159
You set to announce

227
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,719
Predicting that it was a

228
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,511
Ukraine anti defense missile

229
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:26,911
It was in the next war that I got it now it wasn't this world okay but 10 years from now it's the next door that I mailed

230
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,679
About 1

231
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:31,775
I think he could probably gained a little bit of like haha

232
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,799
I wasn't far off

233
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,103
If Trump announced on July 7th

234
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,479
So Alex

235
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,527
Here's one of them

236
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,343
Says we will take America back

237
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
We will put a

238
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:47,903
Stop

239
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,231
Electronic systems immediately

240
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,559
Voter IDs same-day voting and only paper ballots

241
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,351
I hear is the present announcing it

242
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,775
Night announcing my candidacy for president of the United States

243
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,967
We will do whatever it takes

244
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,991
To bring back on

245
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,551
In

246
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,319
Our

247
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:21,951
Eliminate

248
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,511
I will a meeting

249
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,559
Play the band voter-id

250
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,095
Esteemed a voting

251
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,887
Only paper ballots

252
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,703
Alex plays a few clips

253
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,239
Trump speech

254
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:39,615
But he doesn't play some of them that I think we're a really troubling

255
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:46,015
I think he's maybe should have commented on was when he called cities in America cesspools of blood

256
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:49,087
Sure cesspools of blood

257
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,391
I don't know if that even makes gramatik sense

258
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:54,975
He said they were going to go to Mars base on Mars

259
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,023
What's happening

260
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,631
There was a period where he got lost in the term quarters of

261
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:06,751
Sure we're going to take the quarters back

262
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:12,639
He clearly was all scripted just like I want those quarters

263
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,175
Important thing I think

264
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,223
Event Alex needs to Rabat

265
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,015
Hear or talk about is

266
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,295
Trump went on a

267
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,111
White protracted rant about how you need to kill drug deal

268
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:26,463
Dealers in China they have

269
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,743
Quick trials

270
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:33,887
Where they would to catch a drug dealer and then have a quick trial and then that night baby x

271
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,447
Executed and that's what we've got to do here in America

272
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,471
And he even said

273
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,775
It's the only way

274
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,055
What

275
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:44,895
80% of the people I have ever met have dealt

276
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,199
Drugs at one point or another

277
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,991
Tell me baby all dead

278
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,551
Yeah I

279
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,367
I think that's a little bit unhinged

280
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,391
I think it's a

281
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,951
Terrifying

282
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,975
I would say almost

283
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,815
A large portion of the country is leaning

284
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:06,399
Much much more towards decriminalization

285
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,167
More States

286
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:12,799
Are legalizing recreational use of marijuana at roses like

287
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,359
This is your drug dealer

288
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,895
Is that I would have expected

289
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,919
I mean it's

290
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:22,527
Listen far be it for me to not have my pulse on the the modern voter

291
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,111
But I don't think you can go from paper ballots is

292
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,927
The Hallmark of my campaign ad also

293
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,487
Murder on a daily base

294
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,535
I mean it would be

295
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:39,935
Outrageous the amount of murder you would be doing as the state

296
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,959
Listen to this

297
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,031
Fatburgers so offensive to him

298
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,823
To hear has a libertarian

299
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,871
Oh yeah yeah

300
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:53,503
And then to Trump is talking about this as like something that he talked to she about in like

301
00:16:54,015 --> 00:17:00,159
This is something that's trying to does well that's how it should be offended by the idea of taking policy decisions

302
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,439
From communist China

303
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,719
Yai

304
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,999
Wondering

305
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:07,071
If conservatives are aware so far

306
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,399
That's from their tea party beginning

307
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,679
They have

308
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,959
Conservative them

309
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:16,799
Selves all the way into thinking Sharia law is actually pretty great

310
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:22,687
As long as we don't call it that we call it Christian law put a little bit of a different branding

311
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,015
Why not have a dictatorship and murder people all the time

312
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
Right

313
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:33,183
Do you want to do on a dime sack real smaller stuff here is Alyssa

314
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,743
He can't be

315
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,279
We got to kill him we got to kill

316
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,071
40% of America right now

317
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:39,839
It's

318
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,167
I mean look that obviously was

319
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,983
Baby drop going a little off script

320
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,823
His prepared remarks

321
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:57,759
A lot of it was so boring cuz you just reading like reading a prepared thing

322
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,551
Contrite

323
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,343
That part was

324
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,135
Deeply upsetting

325
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,159
Based on

326
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,439
Like Alex's respond

327
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,207
Especially like

328
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:09,023
I question whether Alex watch the full hour or two

329
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:12,095
Right I imagine he might not have

330
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,423
And second if he has them I would say that the

331
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,959
Goal or the

332
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,007
Do you know the move is just like well

333
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:19,775
That's bad

334
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,079
Let's pretend you didn't say that

335
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,151
Go let's just go around the side of it

336
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,175
Yeah I feel like that

337
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,735
Seems to be the main move for just about

338
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:32,063
At this point let's just pretend you didn't say any

339
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:35,135
Let's just get out of really really troubling thing

340
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,439
So Alex

341
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,975
Now that Trump is announced

342
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,511
Has a feeling about

343
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,095
I've been on the fence about Trump

344
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,119
Santa

345
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,655
Extraction

346
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,495
But she called omio khonjin the Democrats in the Deep state

347
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,799
And Ivanka and Jared come out again

348
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,335
Call Dad

349
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,615
Really makes

350
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,639
Text me like Trump more

351
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,455
And watching entire media pylon

352
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,735
Really likes

353
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,015
Really makes me

354
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,319
How much

355
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,599
Power structure

356
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,415
That's

357
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,951
This is so annoying

358
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,303
The more this boat runs into this iceberg

359
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,863
The more I think this Titanic is going to make

360
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:23,263
I think is if we keep reliving this Iceberg a little bit harder I know we're taking on water right

361
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,543
But I think we can

362
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,567
Through

363
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:28,127
Everybody hates this guy and I got to say

364
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,151
Like him

365
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:32,991
I got like that about it

366
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:39,391
Idiot family wishes murder Autumn what's that my highest list

367
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,671
So that you know he's good

368
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,719
So Rodger is on

369
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,487
Images

370
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,511
Also assign

371
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,279
You know like

372
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:51,679
If you're having Rodger on for the response that means you want Pro Trump cover

373
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,471
Rodger not only thinks

374
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,775
That the 2016 election they tried to

375
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,567
The 2020 election

376
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,335
Vastola

377
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:02,431
22 midterm was stolen but what about

378
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,711
1888

379
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,783
Obviously challenging

380
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,831
History Alex only once in our

381
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,599
American

382
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:10,879
Asia president

383
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,159
Grover Cleveland

384
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,951
I was liking 1885

385
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,487
In 1888

386
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,023
It was stolen from him and

387
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,303
Disputed election

388
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,631
Where he clearly by-the-way got a majority the popular vote

389
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,447
And then he came by we caring about that now 9

390
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,215
33

391
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,007
The energy the room last

392
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,799
Remind me of 2050

393
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,567
15 + 20

394
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,847
60 it was

395
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,871
The old

396
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,639
Trump

397
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,407
The old

398
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,431
Hie

399
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,455
Established

400
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,527
He was very

401
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,551
Brandi was very much

402
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:40,831
On message

403
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:44,159
That is not true you ranted about killing drug dealers

404
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,487
For a bit but you just said it was old Trump

405
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,279
Both

406
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,583
Percentage of the word share

407
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:58,751
Death of Grover Cleveland was robbed man I mean I do recall he won the popular vote and there was some shady

408
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,823
Backroom dealing but if it's important to remember

409
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,615
He won the popular vote

410
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,383
He did not

411
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:09,247
Lose the popular vote in all of his election then I was like I was robbed was robbed

412
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,271
Right

413
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:16,672
If the standard of like winning an election is the popular vote

414
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:20,768
Against

415
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:25,376
Use that you got to pretend that doesn't happen so you had to go back

416
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,424
240 years

417
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,264
Whatever

418
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,080
So if you're still in the Rica

419
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,104
Construction errors

420
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,872
It's been a tick

421
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,920
So Alex

422
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,224
People hate Trump

423
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,784
Like it I like it

424
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,320
I saw a Rupert Murdoch

425
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,344
Called Trump

426
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,112
Like he did

427
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,392
Six seven years ago instead

428
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,696
Continue to run I'm not going

429
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,768
Well I mean he did that

430
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,560
Flip flop

431
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,376
Good morning

432
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,144
Captain

433
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,168
He's got the established

434
00:21:59,424 --> 00:21:59,936
Lined up against

435
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,960
Not good

436
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,008
Lined up for him

437
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,056
That does not bode well for

438
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:11,712
Rupert Murdoch hates Trump as a person and has for a long time before his 26

439
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,480
16 Rock

440
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:15,552
A big media figure and Burdock is in the public

441
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:19,392
Publishing business

442
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,440
Unfamiliar with each other at that point

443
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:28,096
Gradually Jared Kushner convince Murdock to sit down and talk with Trump and this led to Murdock realizing the Trump was actually

444
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:33,216
All signs pointed to him being the inevitable Republican nominee so he endorsed

445
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:38,336
I'm sure he would have preferred a different primary candidates who won the nomination but I don't

446
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,104
I think he was going to back

447
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,640
I think he would have

448
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,920
Just feeling I've

449
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,688
You don't like the

450
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,712
This guy

451
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,272
Alright fine he's running good

452
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,040
Important

453
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:52,416
To keep in mind as as people keep trying to throw narratives around people long before

454
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,696
Anything you been

455
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:56,256
Close to a presidential election is run

456
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,536
Is that hay

457
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:02,656
F*** all of these they're arguing bulshit at the end of the day they're going to get in line behind races

458
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,424
Is the most common

459
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,728
Okay I mean

460
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,520
16 should teach a lot of lessons

461
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:10,592
About the primary and how

462
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,408
Sort of humiliated

463
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,456
So many people were who were

464
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:17,248
Trying to take Trump out in

465
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,784
In the primary

466
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,552
They

467
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,344
Fell in line like that

468
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,392
Cowards and weaklings they are

469
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:28,256
So Alex is really just kind of trying to just

470
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:32,096
By supporting Trump basically I mean that's the overall Vibe you're getting here

471
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,168
It looks

472
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,192
Coming out more

473
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:40,288
Start coming out saying no mandate which is already done

474
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,568
And really hammers

475
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,592
Stay away from children

476
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,384
And now more more trumps doing that

477
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,688
In the right direction

478
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,712
I hear you was last night

479
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,992
I will get

480
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,016
Biden's radic

481
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,296
Take a left ideology

482
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,344
Out of our military and I did

483
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,392
I did and in the fridge

484
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,720
Executive

485
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,488
It was gone

486
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,768
We will abolish

487
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,536
Everybody

488
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,560
Didn't covid Band-Aid

489
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,632
And rehire every patriot who was fired

490
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,656
From our military

491
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,936
Weather Nepal

492
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,216
And fullback

493
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,008
Oh boy

494
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,056
What

495
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:13,824
What are we

496
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,592
Talking about

497
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,640
We're talking about hiring

498
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,664
Maxine

499
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:24,064
Deny our folk you didn't want to get a vaccine

500
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,624
Understand conservatives living wackadoodle world

501
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,648
And that's great

502
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:30,976
But I just didn't know that that was a thing that would get an Applause

503
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,768
I wouldn't somebody be like

504
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,304
Hey what about you

505
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:40,960
All of the other problems that were facing you're talking about like drug dealers living

506
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:47,360
I would have gone with a different policy thing again sounds like an insane person

507
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,128
Diary

508
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:51,200
You're not wrong so

509
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,992
You're not getting here is a visual

510
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,296
Thank God

511
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,832
So I'm going to allow

512
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,720
Trump live

513
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,488
Great

514
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,512
Photo up

515
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,048
Rodger

516
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,072
Live

517
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,376
You guys all look great

518
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,680
Schloss

519
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,472
2 lb or something

520
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,264
Dude looks good

521
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,032
Chess

522
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:16,800
Define

523
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,824
Find

524
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,360
Looks good crate

525
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,640
Great

526
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,408
Good look

527
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,432
Presidential

528
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,760
60 lb down

529
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,528
Okay

530
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:32,928
He's plump than usual

531
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:36,512
He's on his 10th bag of blood today

532
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,560
So Rodger has some feelings

533
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,352
What about the House of Representatives

534
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,912
So now that the GOP is going to be

535
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,680
Control

536
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:48,032
Bolin Wiki

537
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,312
Angel

538
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,336
Kevin McCarthy

539
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,616
Selected over Andre

540
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,640
Andrew Beggs

541
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,432
Is essentially meaningless

542
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,224
Make

543
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,248
McCarthy

544
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,784
Speaker the only

545
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,064
That makes him speaker

546
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,368
Is the vote of the Full House

547
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,904
In early January

548
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,696
Juncture

549
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,720
He has to have

550
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,256
At least 280

551
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,280
18

552
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,560
To become speaker

553
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,888
Publicly

554
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,656
Did he has

555
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,448
2 block

556
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,216
That elect

557
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,520
Alberta

558
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,312
The block that elect

559
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,104
And all I

560
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,944
Pretty good politics

561
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,992
I agree so what why

562
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,016
Why is Trump

563
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:30,784
Endorsing a

564
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,624
Fawning all over Kevin McCarthy

565
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,696
I find that problematic

566
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,744
Myself I've argued against it

567
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,536
Explain Trump

568
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,328
Force of Nature and

569
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,608
Sometimes he's wrong

570
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:51,008
That's the kind of guy you want in charge you know what I want somebody who won't listen to anybody and doesn't change his mind even

571
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:51,776
Even if he's wrong

572
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:58,176
Absolutely not become speaker of the house and if he does try to pull a power play he could f***

573
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:00,480
Ground because of really undesirable outcome

574
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,528
The only way that this

575
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:05,344
This works is if he holds the party hostage

576
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,904
If Gabe has like seven votes.

577
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,672
The commit to not

578
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,208
Not flipping no matter what

579
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:13,024
He could threaten to tank the GOP winning the speakership

580
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:19,680
In that situation I guess he could try to force the rest of the GOP reps to get in line with him or let a Democrat be speaker

581
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,704
But I don't

582
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,240
See that possibility happening

583
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:26,592
I think the best thing you can do and I mean this is kind of just decent politics

584
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,360
Is

585
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:32,480
Threatened to do this and then negotiate some kind of a concession

586
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:35,040
With McCarthy

587
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:37,088
Maybe some

588
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:43,488
Positions in

589
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,512
To be the speaker

590
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:51,168
McCarthy is going to be the speaker that is why Trump is being nice to him because they live in Rio

591
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:56,288
Reality I would say that Matt gaetz is probably smart enough to realize

592
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:01,920
That if his profile goes up any higher people are finally going to put him in jail where he belongs

593
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,224
I'm pretty sure he's a criminal of

594
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,808
Many different types I think he problem

595
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,856
It's me as the sort who would love

596
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:14,464
To be speaker in that role I didn't do what I think you would but

597
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,536
The the reality of these numbers

598
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,328
This just doesn't work for him he would have

599
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,096
Have to

600
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,400
Essentially and like

601
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:27,264
Really of the majority leader or the speaker in

602
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,824
Party leadership chat

603
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,104
About corralling boats

604
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:31,872
It's about

605
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,152
Getting people on the same

606
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:33,920
Pedro

607
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:38,784
And if you have seven people or whatever that you're holding the vote hostage for

608
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,576
Going to be very difficult for you to

609
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:45,184
To take all the leadership position of all those people you're just pissed off

610
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,976
Just yourself to be

611
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,256
In charge of it just

612
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,584
I don't I don't I know that Rodger knows though

613
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,400
Yeah yeah he's being a little bit

614
00:28:55,424 --> 00:29:01,056
No it's it's what it's wiser to take a I mean a in any negotiating position

615
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:03,104
You start by saying I would like

616
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,384
100%

617
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,200
Of what it is that we're going to go for and they're like

618
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,224
How about we give you 10

619
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,784
And then you argue from there you know like Matt gaetz

620
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,600
I'm going to see you this week or that was instead

621
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,392
How about you get a nice chair and he's like

622
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,160
I like a nice

623
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,696
Yeah like that's how it work

624
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,816
You'll end up with a committee position or something and everybody will move on

625
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,352
So

626
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,120
Look

627
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,144
Rodger

628
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,424
Had some harsh words

629
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,448
For DeSantis

630
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,800
He's clearly now coming onto a more Trump

631
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:33,824
Position

632
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,384
Where he was kind of like

633
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,408
Both sides

634
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,456
Alex as a

635
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,504
DeSantis is better about the vaccine

636
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,528
Narrative

637
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,320
And Rodger wants Alex

638
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,344
Get off that

639
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:49,184
Go back to the point you made it the very top I want to be very clear about this

640
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,976
His position on

641
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:51,744
Auctionnation

642
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,024
Is it digital

643
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:57,376
If I need to bring you the video of Ron

644
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,400
Katie Michelle

645
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,216
It will protect you from infection

646
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:05,056
I can do them wrong

647
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:10,176
Been coming out against it more and I put in that good

648
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,712
Surgeon General that I would

649
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,552
I'm not a politician

650
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,832
Metronomy party

651
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,904
And so I want Trump

652
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,184
To really hurt

653
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,072
Operating on the issues

654
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,864
And I know you do as well

655
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,632
Political

656
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:30,656
Area

657
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,680
I don't Rodger

658
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,240
Today

659
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,264
Both of them

660
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,800
Oppose mandatory

661
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,592
Both of them

662
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,616
Opposed

663
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,384
Vaccination

664
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,152
Oceans for those

665
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,176
In the military

666
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:44,224
Both of them opposed the mask

667
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,552
Their positions are again

668
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:48,832
Rhetorical

669
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,624
You're right the governor has been more

670
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,648
Aggressive about it

671
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,928
But

672
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,488
The end of the day their positions are denicol

673
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,328
It's interesting how Alex's just like I am

674
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,120
Issue guy

675
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:05,472
I hate vaccines right and if Trump will just

676
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:09,824
Do the thing that I want him to do I'll write a story where he's fine

677
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:14,944
I'll come up with a way to like convince myself that it's all good because

678
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,480
He's doing what I want him

679
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,784
Yeah right

680
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,320
That's about it cool

681
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:25,952
I do appreciate the I'm an issues guy and my issues are

682
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:28,768
If everyone including his family hates him

683
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,048
That makes me think he's pretty

684
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,840
A good pretty good guy for the job

685
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:36,192
I think that that's not an issue for me

686
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:40,544
Rodger wants to scientist to stay governor

687
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,336
I want

688
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,384
Continue the job he's doing

689
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,152
As governor

690
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:47,968
He's been very

691
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,016
42 years old

692
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:53,088
I said yet again

693
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,624
If he wants to run

694
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,160
It's his prerogative

695
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,184
I think

696
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,464
He clears the field

697
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,488
I'm not sure he

698
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,512
Sustain

699
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,280
Alarm

700
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,048
Conversation

701
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,096
He is very good

702
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,144
Controlled environment

703
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,704
He's very control is very good one he controls

704
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,728
Microphone

705
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,032
But in a wide-open free

706
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,568
Fighting debate

707
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,592
With a brawler

708
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,616
Like Donald Trump

709
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,432
Personality

710
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,224
He has he has presents

711
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,784
He's got some off and has itself

712
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,552
Deprecating

713
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,320
Humor

714
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,112
The governor's trying to

715
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:26,880
Charmless

716
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,160
In that regard

717
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,440
Trump has like

718
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,464
A lot of

719
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,256
Ways you could die

720
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:35,072
Describe his humor but self-deprecating isn't one of

721
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:39,424
His candidacy with

722
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:45,312
We are the greatest movement perhaps that has ever happened in the greatest country on Earth

723
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,360
Yeah we are we are

724
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:50,944
It is in a self-deprecating

725
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,248
You could read it that way because it's

726
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:56,832
So narcissistic that you think well there's no way a Riesling

727
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,624
Reasonable human being would be anything but

728
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,672
But cleverly sarcastic about bisque

729
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:04,000
Absurd thing to say even if he's

730
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,560
Operating in the realm of parity I don't think it's

731
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:12,960
It's still a self-deprecating absolutely appropriate

732
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,264
Play something like that about Ron DeSantis 2 days ago

733
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:21,664
I would say can handle itself accepted a control

734
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,712
Environment

735
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:28,320
Charisma Lacey at Rodger just said there was

736
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,904
Trump is going to make him mad and then DeSantis

737
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,464
This is going to ride up dropping all the Slayers that he does

738
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,488
Wednesday on the regular

739
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:43,168
The face is going to be a dick to him know how to handle it and it'll look like an idiot

740
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:49,312
Although I will say I was I was very confident that that was how it would go and we'll go

741
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,104
Up until I read the

742
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,712
Trump's insults Brandis sanctimonious

743
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,248
Garbage

744
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,272
Sauce

745
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,320
Garbage sauce first attempt

746
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:03,136
Yeah it's bad if that's what he's going to come with

747
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:09,536
I'm not worried about Ron DeSantis getting mad I don't think I don't think we're in the throwing hands phase of the

748
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,840
Just opening

749
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:18,240
Right right

750
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,032
We'll see how it goes all right

751
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:21,824
So I only

752
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,128
Say who you

753
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,200
Between trumpet DeSantis

754
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,088
Man I'm supporting

755
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,112
I think overall

756
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,160
Is the better choice in Rage assassin

757
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:36,928
System

758
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,976
They're totally scared of him and

759
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,256
I seen established

760
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,280
DeSantis

761
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,072
Makes my skin crawl but I don't

762
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:49,728
Okay so I'm not going to say who I'm in favor of but one game only gets a positive things about and then the other one was saying negative

763
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,496
Sing about

764
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,032
So you could decide

765
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:56,128
I am hedging my bets

766
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,664
In the least

767
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,688
Legible way

768
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:03,040
Hey I am going to bed at all 99% on this one

769
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,088
And then 1% on the other

770
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:07,904
So you know that I have not yet decided between the

771
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,512
Strategic flexibility

772
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,560
So Rodger has a x

773
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,328
Split Nation

774
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,608
For the midday

775
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,168
Okay now we remember

776
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,192
Boats

777
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:26,592
For North Korea I recall that they were involved in 2020 as game here

778
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,384
No he does not I mean

779
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:34,272
This is the wrong distinctive on Venus

780
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,808
Whether we nominate

781
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,344
Former President Donald Trump

782
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,368
Weather Menomonie

783
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,136
Governor

784
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,672
Santa Shore we nominate

785
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,208
If we can't have

786
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:43,488
Free

787
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,512
Fair

788
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,280
Honest

789
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,048
Transparent

790
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,072
Elections

791
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,376
What's just happened in Arizona

792
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,656
Is an abomination

793
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,008
Did the night before the election

794
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,824
Are the correct

795
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,360
19 in

796
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,384
Long

797
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,664
Election day

798
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,944
The paper ballots

799
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,248
That are sent to only Republican Precinct

800
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,040
20 inches long

801
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,600
Ethically made

802
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:10,624
Not

803
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:15,232
In one case election judge I spoke to said

804
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,512
A person tried to get

805
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,280
The tabulator

806
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,560
Received their ballot

807
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,376
Dean times and it was rejected

808
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,656
Why was rejected

809
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,448
Because the trays

810
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,216
Inside the

811
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:27,008
The calculator are not made

812
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,288
To take

813
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,080
This wasn't done

814
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:30,848
Biax

815
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,896
This was done willfully

816
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:38,272
So apparently the globalists know that they couldn't get away with election hacking fraud

817
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,320
This time and that too many people were out looking

818
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,344
Looking for the ballot mule

819
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,112
So they could

820
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,392
Stop do you know that

821
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,160
There's no good

822
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,952
So the only way they could think

823
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:49,024
To steal the election was sending ballots an inch too big

824
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,816
Republican polling places

825
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:52,864
Here's what I like

826
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,656
About their terrible play

827
00:36:54,912 --> 00:37:00,800
Right all right one the globalist have terrible plans because these people have terrible plans and no imagination

828
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:01,824
Right

829
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,360
The thing about it is

830
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:06,688
There are diminishing returns that their best state

831
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,224
India is a bad

832
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,784
Plan

833
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,320
2 years ago

834
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:16,672
So now we're all the way down to Badland number 55

835
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,696
And globalism

836
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,976
Bad plan is

837
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:19,744
Haha

838
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,840
Add a niche you know how obvious this would be to trace back

839
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:27,936
Like in terms of the production orders of like

840
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:32,800
Who made it an inch bigger

841
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:39,200
It would be required in order to do this would leave such a huge part in the paper turn out

842
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,480
Very obvious

843
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:44,064
Investigation

844
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,904
This is based on the theory that was published in the Gateway pundit relying

845
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,000
Coolio the expertise of one person a guy named Ann Sundin

846
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:55,072
Have you ever this article in Gateway pundit there's a hat tip

847
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,608
Do David and Erin

848
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:59,424
Clements who presumably brought this all to the attention

849
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,472
Of Jim hoft twin brother

850
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:08,128
David Clements is a New Mexico State University Business School Professor who's been suspended from his position because of

851
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,176
Enid mask mandate

852
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:13,760
Backpack

853
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:16,320
Actually I ended with

854
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,600
Also he's got

855
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:21,184
Collect a salary while he's gone on tour around the country

856
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:26,048
Rally's about how the 2020 election was stolen among other various brightwing

857
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,072
Conspiracy topics

858
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:30,400
He's been on that reawakened America Tour

859
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:37,056
Clemens has been making interview videos on Rumble about election fraud nonsense since 2020 and he's

860
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,104
He's interviewed luminaries like Ron Watkins

861
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,152
Naturally damn Sundin

862
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:44,224
Associates in this election fraud stuff over

863
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,016
For the years unbiased

864
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:50,112
Expert to the Gateway pundit

865
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,232
I have no idea who Damn Sundin is other than that his resume is always written

866
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,512
Super vague

867
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,048
On all of these websites

868
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:02,912
He is an expert I know that all right I can tell you one thing about it

869
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:09,312
You've not the same damn Sundin who's on the FBI's most wanted list for cyber crimes

870
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:12,896
Because I watched a video interview with the guy from the election

871
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,176
Broadcast spiracy

872
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:14,944
Andy's look

873
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:21,344
Nothing like the FBI's Most Wanted flyer plastic surgery

874
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,952
Ramen you could age hide in plain sight

875
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,000
I'm I'm fairly convinced

876
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:30,816
100percentpure B.

877
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:33,376
Of course it is like

878
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,424
Unique enough name

879
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,192
That I was

880
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,984
Free

881
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,896
Since before and bolts in the field of

882
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:47,200
Like Technologies

883
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,736
Not not the

884
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,760
It's not the criminal right

885
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:53,856
Anyway Alex was right about this missile

886
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:57,696
Thing until Rodger needs to congratulate him about it

887
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,280
This is really quite extraordinary look how I got up late

888
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,816
Today cuz I was up

889
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,096
Celebrating the

890
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,888
Historic announcement of Ghana

891
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,424
And therefore

892
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,448
When I went

893
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,728
Too bad I heard

894
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,008
Russian missiles

895
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,032
Attack

896
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,592
Then when I came on your broadcast

897
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,616
I saw you

898
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,384
Laying out

899
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,152
The truth

900
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,224
Figuring it will everybody else

901
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,504
Probably be saying

902
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,528
Alex

903
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,832
Nobody

904
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,880
Other than Infowars by and large

905
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,160
Is reporting

906
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:28,928
The truth

907
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,208
This undermines

908
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,768
The important gym Infowars NY

909
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,304
They are so desperate

910
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,096
To take you down

911
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,888
Addition realize the importance

912
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,680
Infowars nyi

913
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,704
Show value

914
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,008
Form and

915
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:44,800
Forum

916
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,080
Because I know

917
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,360
Whenever there is a

918
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,640
Concerted effort

919
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,688
Propaganda regardless

920
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,712
Regardless what the

921
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,480
Weather

922
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,248
Donald Trump

923
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,528
Weather in Chicago

924
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,064
DeSantis or whether it's

925
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,624
The situation in Ukraine or whether it

926
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:01,440
What the red Chinese are up to

927
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,536
Used to go to find out what it is

928
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,072
Really going on

929
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,888
Fearlessly

930
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,168
And when the knowledge

931
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,496
Spiritual Theory

932
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:17,568
Streaming Stick

933
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,592
It's what always

934
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,616
Makes me laugh

935
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,896
White supremacist

936
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:22,944
12

937
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,224
Is Infowars

938
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:30,624
This is such b******* like these assholes Pat themselves on the back so hard every time one of the random denials they make

939
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,904
Make accidentally happened

940
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,184
The end up being accurate

941
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:37,792
Alex did say that he thought the missile that hit Poland was a surface-to-air missile from Ukraine

942
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,584
And it's now. That is the

943
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,608
But

944
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:44,192
So dishonest for him to pretend he was the only person talking about

945
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,056
A Newsweek article from a day before this episode was recorded said quote

946
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:54,175
The Associated Press initially cited an unnamed Cedar us intelligence confirming

947
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,199
That Russia was a

948
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,991
Indeed behind the cross-border strike

949
00:41:57,503 --> 00:42:00,575
Hours later the same Outlet cited three us officials

950
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:04,927
Who said preliminary assessment suggests the missile was fired by Ukrainian forces

951
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,975
In an attempt to

952
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:07,743
To intercept

953
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,279
An incoming Russian missile

954
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:14,143
On the same day is this episode Business Insider published an article including quote

955
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,167
A statement

956
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,447
From the office

957
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,495
Poland's president said it was

958
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,775
Highly probable

959
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,799
That Ukraine had launched

960
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,847
The surface-to-air missile in response

961
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:25,151
Do the Russian barrage and that quote

962
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:27,199
We have no evidence at the moment

963
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:30,783
That the russian-made s-300 missile was fired by rushing for

964
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:35,903
There were a lot of people some random people on Twitter and Summit official position

965
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:39,487
For jumping the gun to blame Russia that is fair enough

966
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,791
But what Alex and Rodger doing is

967
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,839
Just as bad as any of those people

968
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,631
They're manufacturing a fake

969
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,679
Consensus that they stand in opposition

970
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,215
They're pretending

971
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:52,287
That everybody in the media everyone in Government powers

972
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:54,335
Establishment we're pushing the message

973
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:57,919
That Russia did this on purpose and the Article 5 should be info

974
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,199
And it was

975
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,479
Infowars

976
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:02,271
Steve wrongly maligned

977
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,551
Please write truth-tellers

978
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,855
Who had the courage to stand up and say that it looks like

979
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,391
Like it could be a surface-to-air missile

980
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,183
This is an illusion

981
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:13,535
They weren't the only ones to voice this kind of concern in this possibility

982
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,559
This is why

983
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:18,399
White supremacist outlet and they're constantly wrong about almost everything

984
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:21,983
Alex didn't think Putin was going to try and invade past the dawn boss

985
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:25,311
And said that zelensky was a double agent working for Putin

986
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:29,919
He said that Russia had paid off the Ukrainian Army so the war was only going to last a few days

987
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:34,271
He said the Putin was going to pump up probably nuke us tomorrow for like the last

988
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,039
2 months

989
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:37,855
Alex is full of s*** but every now and again

990
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:41,183
One of the things that he says out of a knee-jerk Defiance accidentally happen

991
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,207
And double look

992
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:42,975
Inaccurate

993
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,255
And you

994
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:49,375
You can tell how rare It Is by how excited he gets and how often he needs to bring these things up

995
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,143
He's played

996
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:55,007
Clip of him saying the missile was a surface-to-air missile three times on this episode I believe

997
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,031
I think

998
00:43:56,799 --> 00:44:02,431
I think about every time he has to answer for how he's constantly wrong about everything he just yells jussie Smollett

999
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,479
Okay great yeah

1000
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:10,879
How to make such a cantic deal out of these rare instances and pretend to be thousands of times he's been wrong never happen

1001
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,159
And because this has the effect

1002
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:14,207
Spectre subtly tricking the audience into thing

1003
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:17,023
But he's right way more frequently than he actually is

1004
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:20,607
It's a pretty simple and very intentional manipulation tagged

1005
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,631
Is it going to guess it works

1006
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:22,911
Yeah

1007
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:29,823
The weird thing is this is probably the one spot where you could really kind of dig in with a conspiracy theory

1008
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,359
They just did that

1009
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,127
She's kind of

1010
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,175
That kind of works either

1011
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:34,943
Either way

1012
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,223
You know like a

1013
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,759
If you're saying to me

1014
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,551
Take the conspiracy theory

1015
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:43,903
Is all the governments involved in this except for the Ukrainian government

1016
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:47,231
Have kind of correctly realize that if it is Russians

1017
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,767
Missiles

1018
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:53,119
They did fire them at even if it was an accident it did cross over into Poland

1019
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:55,167
That's a real big problem

1020
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,703
Right

1021
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:58,495
If it's an accident

1022
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:04,895
Maybe we all just say Ukraine baby accident and then it's less of a problem still a problem

1023
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:09,759
But it's not the same problem now is it now if that what if we find out

1024
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:12,831
60 years later they do the investigation and that's true

1025
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,111
Fine that's great

1026
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:14,879
It's just

1027
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,671
Why are you saying that you got

1028
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:18,719
This part right this is a boring part

1029
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:23,583
I understand I understand what you're saying boring narrative

1030
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:28,447
Conspiracy should be what you're saying

1031
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,215
Can't

1032
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,031
Because that would require him to say that Russia

1033
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:38,687
Right but I mean then he also gets to say everybody on the way in the west is lying I mean I'd so confusing

1034
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,223
Right but they're lying

1035
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:42,271
Runaway that is advantageous

1036
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:44,575
The Russia is angle would be

1037
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:49,695
Actually attack a NATO country

1038
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:56,095
I think I think you would have some problems spinning get drunk

1039
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,703
If you were is you're talking about just like writing a

1040
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,983
Conspiracy theory

1041
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,031
You're right it is a dozen

1042
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:04,799
More

1043
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,591
Like intriguing Yarns

1044
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,359
Yeah

1045
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,455
So you got a

1046
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,223
Support info

1047
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:13,247
We know that

1048
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,527
And there's a reason

1049
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:15,551
And it's

1050
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,343
He has a billion and a half dollars

1051
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:18,623
Well that

1052
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,647
That's the real reason

1053
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,951
But there's a storytelling reason

1054
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:24,255
Comedian makes fun of Rodger Stone

1055
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,023
Challenge

1056
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,559
Sign Stone

1057
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,351

Supplements

1060

And so please

1061
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:42,687
You're not going to get the information we're not to cover next hour

1062
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,455
Anywhere else

1063
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:44,991
Euthanasia

1064
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,271
Children has now begun

1065
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,367
Starting here

1066
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,391
What

1067
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:54,719
I was reporting on

1068
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,487
Yesterday

1069
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,023
I'ma start the next hour on that

1070
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:57,791
Oh boy

1071
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,351
So yeah they're euthanizing children that's why you've got a

1072
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,887
Supportive

1073
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:05,215
So just what are they content warning

1074
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:07,519
I guess I don't think anything is

1075
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:11,615
To severe but there's a lot of conversation about like assisted suicide

1076
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:16,991
In the in the coming clips

1077
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:19,295
Some feelings

1078
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:20,831
That's going to be a

1079
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:24,415
Much like Raptors it will Factor heavily into this conversation

1080
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:27,487
So here's that you know

1081
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:28,255
Alex

1082
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,303
We always love it when he

1083
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:32,095
Tells us about how

1084
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:32,863
We Belong

1085
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,143
The city we do belong to

1086
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:35,423
But sometimes

1087
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,703
There's other songs

1088
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:39,263
But he rants over we can belong to many places

1089
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:43,871
If I'm like a judge I'm giving this 104.7

1090
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:49,759
Evil force

1091

In the history

1092
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:57,439
They're covered operations have now been drawn out in the open

1093
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:58,975
Process

1094
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:00,255
Trying to break us

1095
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,047
Process

1096
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,071
Their downfall

1097
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,887
It has been foretold

1098
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:07,935
And now

1099
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:10,495

00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:49,663
They've been baited

1120
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,479
Government intimidated social

1121
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,271
Suicide

1122
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:55,807
Wow yeah

1123
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:56,575
No I think

1124
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:59,903
Pinkeye mostly gave it a 4.7 because I think it songs all right

1125
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:06,303
Yeah I mean it doesn't have the timing right at the beginning you know he's talking over the wrong

1126
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,071
Song parts

1127
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:10,655
And they're just so you know there's just songs that have

1128
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,935
It's just

1129
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:14,495
You Belong To The City that makes it

1130
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:20,895
Perfect for yelling not enough I don't know what it is but it sounds like something I could definitely

1131
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:26,271
They have on in the background

1132
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,295
Snow

1133
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,367
I've started the crack the code

1134
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:33,951
I think Alex really just like saying and now

1135
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:41,631
He likes it who hasn't spent a couple of days getting into the La Fontaine for a little too long

1136
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:44,447
Come on

1137
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:49,311
You know world

1138
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:52,383
J'adore

1139
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,407
Ditto world

1140
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,199
So here we go

1141
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,991
Alex gets down to business

1142
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,783
Incites these two stories

1143
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,807
Already has

1144
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:00,831
Regarding

1145
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:04,159
Assisted suicide

1146
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:10,559
Is it like that killing children euthanizing children pray and government social credit score

1147
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:11,839
Blah blah blah

1148
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,119
Together

1149
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:16,959
Do all of this

1150
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:18,751
We're going to be getting to

1151
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:21,567
Shoulder that frown

1152
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,895
It's one of the report's globalist push

1153
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:25,919
Mass

1154
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:26,687
Suicide

1155
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:33,343
So these are the two stories that Alex is operating off of and I guess they proved that the government is trying to force people into being youth

1156
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:39,999
Sure the first headline that he read is Canadian law it's just the title of a

1157
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:43,839
The great race video those cribbing mostly from a Tucker Carlson segment

1158
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:48,703
And that take me to self is reporting on an article that was posted on Barry Weiss's Subs

1159
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:55,871
All of this just boils down to the Canadian Parliament passing the revision to their medical assistance in dying legislature

1160
00:50:56,383 --> 00:51:01,759
Also known as their maid maid legislation Sheriff about who is eligible

1161
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:02,783
To receive that care

1162
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:06,111
This revision was passed in March 2021

1163
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,391
But it doesn't take effect

1164
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,415
Until next year

1165
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:13,023
In that revision they repealed the requirement that the patient's natural death

1166
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:15,327
Was quote reasonably foreseeable

1167
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:18,143
Which is to say that they opened up this kind of care to patients

1168
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:20,191
2 or not immediately terminal

1169
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:21,983
But might be living in

1170
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:24,287
A terrible amount of pain that is

1171
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,567
Treatable

1172
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:28,895
The revision also specified quote

1173
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:33,503
Person to Soul underlying medical condition is mental illness are not eligible

1174
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,551
For medical assistance and died

1175
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:40,159
That is something that is obscured by Tucker's coverage and then now Alex's

1176
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,183
Just completely lying

1177
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:45,791
Even if you take everything that Tucker says in his report as truth

1178
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,583
Person who Keys Bass

1179
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,399
His entire story on his 23 years old

1180
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,423
So this is not a child

1181
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,191
Yeah

1182
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:54,495
The headline quotes globalist

1183
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:59,359
Push mass suicide is just a video that was posted on Band. Video

1184
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:02,175
It's a John bowne report just

1185
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,199
A lot of it is

1186
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:06,015
Covering similar territory and so Alex

1187
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,807
And I'm talking about the globalist

1188
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:11,391
The second headlines

1189
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,415
Tubidy

1190
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,695
The first one does bring up a

1191
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:16,511
Fairly important conversation which is

1192
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:17,791
Be sticky issues

1193
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:20,095
Around assisted end-of-life care

1194
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:25,983
Obviously I do support access to this guy care but there are cases where things can be a little bit complicated

1195
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:28,799
I do think that these are things that people should be talking

1196
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:32,639
Perspectives of folks Tucker and Alex are worth

1197
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:39,551
They aren't dealing with the issues as they actually exist they're creating a fake version of the issue to use as a prop to attack their prey

1198
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:44,927
Political enemies and keep their audiences in fear about how they're going to force your kids to be euthanized or whatever

1199
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,975
And in reality

1200
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:52,351
When we get this there is going to be going to play a little bit of the gray grease report

1201
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,399
It is

1202
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:57,471
Kind of a weird situation

1203
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:01,567
Actually I have a suggested solution to a Malak

1204
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,127
Whole crew

1205
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:07,711
So anyway here's the intro

1206
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:08,991
The gregorys report

1207
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:13,343
Big Banks 2 the human is promoting

1208
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:14,367
Government

1209
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,647
Termination of

1210
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,207
Physically disabled

1211
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:19,999
Calling it liberal and trendy

1212
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,535
Bill Gates

1213
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:23,071
On steroids

1214
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,863
There is a critical graduation

1215
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,143
I'll give you the rest

1216
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,167
Public Storage

1217
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:31,519
First of all I can't believe that Alex doesn't call these Reese's Pieces

1218
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,823
It's such a f****** missed opportunity

1219
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,967
No happen instantly

1220
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:44,575
Peace out peace from Reese himself

1221
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:47,647
Aretha Aretha

1222
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:52,255
Yeah you should watch out for

1223
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:55,839
No they do Reese's Pieces would be so good

1224
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:57,119
I don't think they get sued

1225
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,703
When he goes to church

1226
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:01,727
She's always talk about race

1227
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:02,495
Jesus

1228
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:03,775
Anyway this is a

1229
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:09,919
Completely inaccurate description of the report the entire underlying story

1230
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:12,479
But here is the beginning of the report

1231
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:15,039
The film Soylent Green

1232
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:15,807
Was made

1233
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:17,087
In 1970s

1234
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,111
NSAID

1235
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:19,647
Topian world

1236
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,671
In the year

1237
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:21,951
2022

1238
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:26,815
Where the government is restoring the people food it was made of people

1239
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:27,839
Cold

1240
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:29,887
Pleasant experience

1241
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:30,655
Estate

1242
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:31,423
Assistance

1243
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,191
Suicide

1244
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,239
While government-run media

1245
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:35,263
Is the idea

1246
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,287
Cannibalism

1247
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,311
Government assisted

1248
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:38,335
Suicide

1249
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:40,127
Is officially now a thing

1250
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:41,919
2022

1251
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:46,015
Medicine

1252
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,295
To keep you alive

1253
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:49,087
What

1254
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,111
For insurance

1255
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:51,903
These days

1256
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:54,463
The hospital seemed more likely to liquid

1257
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:57,535
And they will help you kill your

1258
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:00,351
I don't really want to die

1259
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:02,911
Amir farsooda has applied for medically is

1260
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:04,703
Assisted dying known as made

1261
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:06,495
He lives in constant agony

1262
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,055
Start the process

1263
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,615
Because his rooming houses

1264
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,663
For sale any can't find anywhere else

1265
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:15,199
Live that he can afford

1266
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:18,783
He barely survived Ontario Disability support

1267
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:21,599
Hundred dollars a month

1268
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,135
He doesn't want to die

1269
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,415
But being homeless

1270
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:25,439
It's not an option

1271
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,719
I know in my

1272
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:27,999
Present health condition I would

1273
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,023
Survive it anyway

1274
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:34,655
There is no answer in Alex's world for this problem other than to let pursued die on the street

1275
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:41,055
They would be opposed to the government paying for his housing they will be opposed to the government providing with free healthcare so what the app

1276
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:41,823
Actual answer

1277
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:46,687
I'm not saying the pursued should go to assisted suicide because of the circle

1278
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:47,711
Constanta is like

1279
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,991
But I think that this

1280
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:53,599
Situation does highlight a really sticky issue where the reality of what he's living through

1281
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:56,159
Brings into Focus how cruel the system itself

1282
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,183
We is

1283
00:55:57,695 --> 00:56:00,511
This video from the Canadian news is about a month

1284
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:03,583
The old and five point Reese's making this video

1285
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,655
Fursuit head actually launched a successful GoFundMe

1286
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:11,775
I need raise $60,000 to secure his housing and he's gone public that he no longer is

1287
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:13,311
Considering medically-assisted

1288
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:18,687
Pursued has a really good perspective on the ethical issue about how his poverty

1289
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:20,223
Was driving his thinking

1290
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:23,039
From a Toronto City News article

1291
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,831
Quote he said government

1292
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:26,111
Should be focused

1293
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:29,951
On fixing the issue causing poverty rather than the more RAM

1294
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:32,255
Implications of those in poverty seeking made

1295
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:34,815
I think the proper solution is

1296
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:37,887
Do not have that problem is to alleviate what's causing

1297
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:38,655
Problem

1298
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:41,727
If Society is concerned about people like me and like

1299
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:44,287
Million other people on

1300
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,311
ODSP

1301
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:46,335
PM property

1302
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:48,383
Then bring them out of poverty

1303
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,919
That's the obvious solution

1304
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:55,807
If they were out of poverty and they had a roof over their head and food in their mouths I guarantee you made wouldn't be a

1305
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:56,575
Consideration

1306
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:58,111
The whole debate would become

1307
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:58,879
Superfluous

1308
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:05,279
I'm certain that Infowars will not follow up on the story and cover this comment from first food because

1309
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:07,071
They aren't interested in this respect

1310
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:09,119
They want to use him as a prop

1311
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:13,471
To build up a fraudulent argument that the government is trying to force people to kill themselves

1312
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:16,543
But they'd honestly be pretty fine with letting him die on the street

1313
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:17,823
Especially if they knew like

1314
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:19,871
But they could call him a communist

1315
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,407
For his ideas

1316
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:25,503
Or whatever you know like this but this is a little bit of a difficult

1317
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:28,575
He has an underlying

1318
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:29,599
A chronic

1319
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:30,879
Health condition

1320
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:33,951
There is miserable for him to live with without

1321
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:37,023
Proper care and a place to live

1322
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:41,119
Any poverty is threatening access to that medical

1323
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:41,887
Care

1324
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,679
To live

1325
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:47,263
Obviously the solution isn't

1326
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:48,031
Well

1327
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:48,799
Vertically

1328
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:49,567
Suicide

1329
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:50,591
Hey buddy

1330
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:53,151
Highlights how someone in that situation

1331
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:57,247
Would look at that as like well I'm going to die on the street anyway

1332
00:57:59,039 --> 00:57:59,807
Let's start

1333
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:02,623
The clear the Clear Point is almost kind of

1334
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:04,671
Tusimple insofar as

1335
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:05,439
Like

1336
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:07,487
What is the point of the government

1337
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:09,791
Of all of us together if we can't even basic

1338
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:13,631
You can get them simple Maslow's hierarchy of needs handled you know

1339
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:15,935
And if you're saying that I can't have

1340
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:16,703
Eaccess

1341
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:18,239
Food water or shelter

1342
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:20,799
Consistently or or

1343
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:21,823
Guaranteed

1344
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:24,127
If I can't have guaranteed access to those

1345
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:25,407
Then death is

1346
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,711
Borderline a lateral move

1347
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:31,295
Or at the very least I'm living right next to it every single day of my life

1348
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:32,831
That's what he's expressing

1349
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:37,183
Really what you're saying is that whoa whoa whoa whoa we want God to kill you

1350
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:40,255
We don't want you to have control over anything

1351
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:41,791
Yeah it end

1352
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:48,191
I I just I think that Beyond this were bored being embarrassingly produced

1353
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:48,959
Doesn't

1354
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:50,495
It doesn't really touch

1355
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:52,287
What the real issue

1356
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,055
Who is here

1357
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:54,079
Or what

1358
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:56,895
The the subject of the stories perspective

1359
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:59,967
And I think that that is

1360
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:00,991
Dishonest

1361
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:02,527
Ingenuous

1362
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:06,111
Exploding people's discomfort with death

1363
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:08,927
Using that same emotional trigger

1364
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:09,951
Like they do with

1365
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:14,047
Lgbtq or any number of those things that allows you to

1366
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:15,071
Override

1367
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:17,119
Here even ability to think

1368
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:22,751
And really when you break this down this Amir fursuits

1369
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:26,335
Story is about somebody who is

1370
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:28,639
Facing the prospect

1371
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:31,455
I'm living on the street with a chronic

1372
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,223
Condition

1373
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,039
Causes severe pain

1374
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:36,063
And all this

1375
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:37,087
Bambi

1376
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:38,623
Because of that he's gay

1377
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:39,647
Considering

1378
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:40,927
End-of-life

1379
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:41,951
Medical assistant

1380
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:42,975
Right

1381
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:43,999
That is

1382
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:44,767
The story

1383
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:47,327
It is about the poverty driving

1384
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:48,863
This

1385
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,655
With the underlying medical condition

1386
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:52,703
And of course is not just his poverty bright

1387
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:57,055
It's being reported on Infowars as an instance of the government wanting to

1388
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:57,823
To kill you

1389
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,615
Yeah and that's not

1390
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,383
Correct

1391
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:01,151
No

1392
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:02,687
He's exploiting

1393
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:03,711
This person's

1394
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:04,479
Pain

1395
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,247
Because

1396
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:06,783
Quite frankly

1397
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:09,343
If presented accurately

1398
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,391
The audience would come to the conclusion

1399
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:14,719
Too easily that the answer is the opposite of Alex's polity

1400
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:18,303
I mean well the answer is in a in a certain sense

1401
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,607
The government is killing him slowly

1402
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:23,167
And that's why he's considered

1403
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:24,959
That's the point

1404
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:28,031
Is that if you're saying that the government is doing

1405
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:30,079
Their job well right now

1406
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:33,663
That is going to lead to this man's death you have sentenced him to death

1407
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:36,223
And you sentence him to pain as he waits for it

1408
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,783
So there's more to this report

1409
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:40,575
Greg's analysis

1410
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:42,879
I already did

1411
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,951
According to the Canadian government

1412
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:47,743
They are getting several requests

1413
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:49,023
For suicide

1414
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:49,791
From children

1415
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:51,583
Do they refer to as

1416
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,119
Mature minors

1417
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,423
And they are seeking to amend the laws

1418
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:57,727
So that these children can be euthanized

1419
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:58,751
Without their

1420
01:00:59,007 --> 01:00:59,775
Parents consent

1421
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:00,799
There are posts

1422
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:02,847
On social media that suggest

1423
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:03,615
This might be

1424
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:05,919
Betru we shouldn't surprise anyone

1425
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:12,575
It really concern any of Reese's viewers that he seems to be citing the Canadian government but also saying that post on social

1426
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,855
Media seem to indicate

1427
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:14,879
This is true

1428
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,415
Like that's not good

1429
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:20,255
And it should tell you the great did zero research on this subject

1430
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:24,863
Social media Post in the government

1431
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,911
So here are some things you need to keep in mind

1432
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:33,311
Assisted dying for children has been legal in the Netherlands since 2002 and in the intervening 13 years

1433
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:35,871
7 children deprived themselves of that care

1434
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:38,431
Belgium made this it's kind of metal

1435
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:42,015
Willcare legal in 2014 and three children sought that care

1436
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:42,783
Between 20

1437
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:43,807
16 + 27

1438
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,111
It's something that has a precedent

1439
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:52,255
And other countries experience tells us that it's something that's used by people including children who has severe medical condition

1440
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:55,327
That are not treatable and caused a great deal of supper

1441
01:01:56,095 --> 01:02:00,447
Mature minor is a term that exists in Canadian and American law already

1442
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:03,007
It's not something that's being used specifically in this case

1443
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:04,543
Which is how Greg is

1444
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:06,335
Definitely trying to make it sound

1445
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:08,383
The Council of Canadian

1446
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,663
Academies did a study

1447
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:11,967
And their conclusion was that the law

1448
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:15,551
Already exists that mature minors can make medical decisions

1449
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:16,831
For themselves that involved

1450
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:17,855
Informed consent

1451
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:21,695
And that there isn't really a compelling reason that this should be any different

1452
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:23,231
When it comes to medically-assisted

1453
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:24,255
That the reason

1454
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,535
Something that makes

1455
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:26,559
This a different

1456
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:29,631
Case from other informed consent

1457
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:30,655
Surrounding

1458
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:31,679
Mature minors

1459
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,959
The only thing that makes it different

1460
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:34,239
Friend is your discomfort with

1461
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:41,151
You know scientifically automatically or whatever you know possibility in your mind

1462
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:45,759
That maybe we will find a cure or something you know sure cold hard logic

1463
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:50,623
Doesn't give you an excuse to be like I but this is different just because

1464
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:53,439
The organization dying with dignity and suggested

1465
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:55,487
Safeguard where informed consent

1466
01:02:55,743 --> 01:03:01,887
Apparel Guardian would be required for patients aged 12 to 15 and

1467
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:04,703
Patient with a parent or Guardian would be required for people

1468
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:06,239
860 + 7

1469
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:09,311
Which seems like I mean it's not going

1470
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:13,919
I without the parent's consent even for these mature minors we shouldn't have

1471
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:14,943
The ability

1472
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:16,223
Me to record

1473
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:17,759
Recognize consent to

1474
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:20,063
It's up in terms of their medical decisions

1475
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:25,695
Even if you're 16 or 17 it would still require consultation with a parent or

1476
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:26,975
Yeah I know I mean

1477
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:29,279
The numbers themselves of already

1478
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:30,047
Make something

1479
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,583
Really clear which is black

1480
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:32,863
If it's been

1481
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:33,887
Available

1482
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,703
Since 2002 or 2004 whatever

1483
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:38,751
And in the intervening time a total of

1484
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:41,823
7 people

1485
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:43,615
The population cycle 30

1486
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:48,223
40% of their body

1487
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:50,015
Next Generation

1488
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:52,319
Text Lee they got to start all over

1489
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:57,183
It is a very small numbers

1490
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,487
I think I think it is something that

1491
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:00,511
We can

1492
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:07,167
Trust people at 80 is it somebody is struggling with suicidal ideation and and of course

1493
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:09,727
The Tempest

1494
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:11,263
It is it is like

1495
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,311
You can trust people too

1496
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:14,591
To want to live

1497
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:16,895
You know there are times when you don't

1498
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:20,735
But at the end of the day if you're if you have to wait up

1499
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:21,503
Month

1500
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:25,087
You you're going to find a reason to go to let you want to live

1501
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,623
You just want to

1502
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:28,159
Honestly

1503
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:28,927
Like

1504
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:31,231
The the circumstances that these

1505
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:33,535
Children and their parents are in

1506
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:37,631
Art so difficult to imagine

1507
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:39,167
I don't

1508
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:40,191
No

1509
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:43,263
I don't think

1510
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:49,663
That the government certainly should ever be like hey you should kill your kid and I don't think that is happening

1511
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:52,735
I don't think I've ever done that ever one time no

1512
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:58,367
Think that if a parent and a doctor and the child are all

1513
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,903
Kind of the mind of like

1514
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:01,439
This suffering is never going

1515
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,743
It's so hard

1516
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:05,535
For the effect the child dozen

1517
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:10,399
Want to continue to feel like the government

1518
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:11,167
Really

1519
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:12,959
It seems very cruel.

1520
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:15,007
To not allow

1521
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:15,775
Call option

1522
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:19,615
There should be absolutely support a f***

1523
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:20,383
This law

1524
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:26,783
You know it's a hard complicated and emotionally heavy subject don't get why people have strong emotional wreck

1525
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:29,599
Directions around these kinds of issues but from the bottom of my heart

1526
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:30,879
I have to say

1527
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:31,903
And continue to stress

1528
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:34,975
The Alex and enforce contribution to this conversation

1529
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:35,743
You worthless

1530
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:36,767
And counterproductive

1531
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:39,327
They aren't even living in reality

1532
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:40,351
I don't

1533
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,143
Just think

1534
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:44,447
They should shut the fuk up I know

1535
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:47,263
It's not helping there's so many things where it is like

1536
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:49,823
Of All That Jazz

1537
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:50,847
Stay out of this

1538
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:57,503
You know like I'm mad at them for all alright but I'm mad at him for all of their bulshit but

1539
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:59,551
Sometimes they just go places where it's like just

1540
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:01,343
Just f****** stay away from the

1541
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:03,135
Getaway

1542
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:07,487
It's different for you and me probably the things that they have that reaction to

1543
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:12,095
But I think I find it more offensive when there is a point

1544
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,631
Again

1545
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,679
The the Maybe

1546
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,471
Everybody should have

1547
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:22,079
Free access to end of universe

1548
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:25,407
That is somewhere where there is

1549
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:27,455
Conversation

1550
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:28,479
You know he's

1551
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:32,063
Is relevant and they're right

1552
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:33,087
Prayer

1553
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:38,975
They're making that conversation much more difficult to have in a sane and rational world

1554
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:42,815
Right and I think that hurts the people who

1555
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:45,119
Are most hurt already

1556
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,655
Yeah you should let me know

1557
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:48,703
A reasonable conversation include

1558
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:50,239
Sissy for the people that this is

1559
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:51,007
Panang 2

1560
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:52,287
By themselves

1561
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:53,823
Dealing with all this stuff

1562
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:54,847
And instead it

1563
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:57,663
People arguing about the government trying to kill you

1564
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,991
So yesterday last clip for by great report this is f*****

1565
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:01,759
Consume

1566
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:04,575
And a motive for helping Canadians kill themselves

1567
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:05,599
Is allegedly

1568
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,135
To save the government money

1569
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:09,439
Allegedly million-dollar

1570
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:10,463
So

1571
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,231
And that's like

1572
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:13,279
Four missiles flying to Ukraine

1573
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:15,071
The government has infinite money for

1574
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:16,863
Refugees and for

1575
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,911
You know foreign aid and for

1576
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:21,727
Democratic campaigns and fur

1577
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,519
Waging War in Ukraine

1578
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:24,543
But no money.

1579
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:25,567
Keep people alive

1580
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:28,127
That's too expensive

1581
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:32,991
Couple million foreigners every year put them on the

1582
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:35,039
Free healthcare

1583
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:36,575
What

1584
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:38,623
Average Canadian

1585
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:40,159
Sorry

1586
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,439
Sorry

1587
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:43,487
It's time to Suicide it's time for death

1588
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:45,023
After 6,000

1589
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:46,047
400

1590
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:47,071
+ 65

1591
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:47,839
Individual

1592
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,631
Committed suicide

1593
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:51,167
With the help of made

1594
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:52,447
Medical assistance

1595
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:53,215
In dying

1596
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:55,263
The Canadian government save

1597
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,031
86

1598
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:57,567
.9 million-dollar

1599
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:00,383
About $13,000

1600
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:01,407
Person

1601
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:03,455
That's what an individual's life

1602
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:04,223
Is worth

1603
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:06,527
In Canada what

1604
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,575
Running

1605
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:11,903
Savings from made are so far negligent

1606
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,207
What does suicide program

1607
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:15,231
Should continue

1608
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:17,535
Don't cost that much

1609
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,815
Really

1610
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:20,095
Wrapping this up

1611
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:22,655
Maybe you could have people pay tickets like maybe

1612
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:24,447
Maybe this is solution maybe in Canada

1613
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,471
You pay like

1614
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,775
10000 bucks and you get to kill somebody

1615
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:29,823
This is the predictable outcome

1616
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:32,895
Unbelievable

1617
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:39,295
Totally predictable that's exactly what I was thinking

1618
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:42,367
Stabbing chair

1619
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:43,647
I think it was

1620
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:50,047
The only evidence is being provided here that the government of Canada is motivated by saving money is Harrison Smith another in

1621
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:52,095
Infowars employee saying so

1622
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:53,375
This is not good report

1623
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:58,751
In reality the number that Harrison is siding comes from an October 2020 report titled

1624
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:01,567
Cost estimate for Bill c-7

1625
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:03,103
Medical assistance in Dyer

1626
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:07,967
Who conducted by the Parliamentary budget officer and it was prompted by the request

1627
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:09,247
Cast of an unnamed senator

1628
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:10,783
They looked at numbers

1629
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:17,183
From the Netherlands and Belgium as guides and found that it would be about 90 million in medical

1630
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:18,463
Expenses would be saved by the

1631
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:22,559
Well basically what they're both sight and Greg and Harrison

1632
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:26,399
However it's very clear this report when it says quote

1633
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:29,983
Many Studies have shown that healthcare costs in the last year of Life Ardis

1634
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,775
Proportionately High representing between

1635
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:34,079
10 and 20% of Total Healthcare cost

1636
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:37,663
Despite these patients representing about 1% of the population

1637
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:38,687
Nevertheless

1638
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:45,343
This report should in no way be interpreted as suggesting that made can be used to reduce

1639
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,623
Healthcare costs

1640
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,415
This is

1641
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:52,511
How Harrison is interpreting the report and then Greg is using Harrison's

1642
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:54,559
Fraudulent interpretation to the jet

1643
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:55,839
Canadian government

1644
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:57,887
Is motivated by Financial

1645
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:58,655
Consideration

1646
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:00,703
Do Opera assisted dying

1647
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:01,983
Kancare does bulge

1648
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:04,543
The actual report the Harrison is sighting

1649
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:05,567
Includes this part

1650
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:07,359
That he conveniently ignored

1651
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:13,759
Include expanding access to maid will result in a net reduction and healthcare costs

1652
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,039
For the provincial

1653
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:20,927
However this reduction represents a negligible portion of the healthcare budgets of the province

1654
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,463
Doctor

1655
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,255
New saputro route

1656
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,279
In 2017

1657
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:29,119
We should strive to save on suffering and invest more in its

1658
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:30,655
Jan which may in turn reduce

1659
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:32,447
Request for medical Aid in dying

1660
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:36,031
Infowars and everyone who work there are raft of liars

1661
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,311
Their argument suck

1662
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,335
They just make

1663
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:42,431
Most of what they're saying up and the rest is based on them abusing primary sources

1664
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,711
And misrepresenting them

1665
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:49,599
And the solution to the problem they're pretending to be so upset about is the thing that they entirely don't support

1666
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:52,415
Does more government spending on social welfare program

1667
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:54,719
This is just a dead end of them

1668
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:56,767
I'm complaining about something they don't care about the begin with

1669
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:04,703
I mean living even he even says that the government says it's negligible it's almost like in the report that guys are like

1670
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:05,727
Why are you make

1671
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:07,775
I don't want to do the

1672
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,823
Cost budget analysis for a

1673
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:12,895
Why did I wake up today and have to

1674
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:14,943
To do the cost budget analysis

1675
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,479
Suicide

1676
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:17,503
Harrison's

1677
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:23,391
Like his whole thing is like all they have all this money to send things to Ukraine but not to keep people up

1678
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:24,927
Oh so you want the government

1679
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:29,023
Set

1680
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,303
Priorities

1681
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:31,583
The federal government

1682
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:35,423
Bunch of f***************

1683
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:41,823
Stop just tell me wait if you could point you old what you want then say it and back it up and then whenever you find out you're a f******

1684
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:48,223
Idiot say I'm sorry for being an idiot

1685
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:50,271
All right how am I God

1686
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:51,807
So Alex

1687
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:52,575

We need to have

01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,335
On Donald Trump

1699
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:16,127
This subject

01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:18,175
Really really bothering me

We will do

1705
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:28,927

2 hours

1709
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:40,191
I'm called on

1710
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:41,215
Is Trump good

1711
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:42,239
Or do people support

1712
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:45,055
I have mixed feelings as well

1713
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:45,823
Okay

1714
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:46,847
Appreciate you

1715
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:48,639
Did Charles back on tomorrow

1716
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:55,039
That's what you're supposed to be doing nothing you said you were hungry and I made that unreal

1717
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:58,111
Punt Pass

1718
01:12:58,367 --> 01:13:03,231
The whole thing is supposed to be taking calls what do you think about Trump and his announcement

1719
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:05,791
So

1720
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:07,839
So anyway

1721
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,887
In Las Vegas Nevada

1722
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:11,167
Go ahead

1723
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:11,935
Going

1724
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:13,471
What's going on

1725
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:19,359
How in the world are you

1726
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,199
When there's

1727
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,479
Any children

1728
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:26,271
Bodies

1729
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,087
More and more

1730
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:31,903
We shot

1731
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:32,671
He's backing off

1732
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:34,207
When I watch that

1733
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:36,255
Interviewer podcast

1734
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:38,303
Greatest

1735
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,863
Achievement of his administration

1736
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:44,191
That was

1737
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:45,983
I don't think

1738
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:46,751
Perfect

1739
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:50,847
I'm just glad he's backing off of them

1740
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:53,919
Do you take the Santa's better being back

1741
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:55,455
Deep state

1742
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:57,503
I think we need to get

1743
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:59,295
Brand new

1744
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:00,063
Say something

1745
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:02,623
The RICO Act

1746
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:03,391
Treason

1747
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:07,487
Gold

1748
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:15,935
For how long

1749
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:21,311
We've gotten here B

1750
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:22,591
Hey everybody

1751
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:24,895
I'm having flashbacks

1752
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:28,991
We're just never going to change

1753
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:32,575
Oh yeah maybe

1754
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:36,671
Let's do that again let's run it again everybody from the top

1755
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:43,071
So this caller actually has a good point in terms of remembering Alex's rhetoric

1756
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:49,471
Remember what Alex's says and then speak it back to him he goes oh at makes me feel how can you possibly

1757
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:55,103
Be in favor of this person who has murdered a million children or whatever

1758
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:59,711
Stacking up millions of bodies repair poisonous shot

1759
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:00,735
Alyssa

1760
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:02,015
I have some problem

1761
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:04,319
Right haystacks

1762
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:05,599
Except a lot of bodies

1763
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:06,623
Short

1764
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:09,183
Sure but who is going to trigger the lip

1765
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:10,719
Screw

1766
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:13,023
As no charisma

1767
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:16,351
So Alex remembers that he made an ultimatum

1768
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:18,655
The Trump about the vaccine do that

1769
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:20,959
You still can't vote for a guy

1770
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:22,239
Not

1771
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:23,263
Being open

1772
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:24,287
About these

1773
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:26,335
From the shop

1774
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:31,199
Adecco

1775
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:32,735
That's why I'm very very torn about this

1776
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:37,855
You shouldn't be this is actually this is an argument for you being Less store

1777
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:39,135
About it because like

1778
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:41,695
If you put the ultimatum out and Trump didn't care

1779
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:46,303
That should tell you that you have no purchase here

1780
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,071
Cuckoo

1781
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:48,351
He doesn't give a s***

1782
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:51,679
Look I made the ultimatum

1783
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:58,079
He didn't listen and so I am not going to stick to my end of the ultimatum right

1784
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:05,759
If there's one ultimatum that I think of when I think of my ultimatums I think of that time Obama gave that ultimatum and you know how

1785
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:06,527
All that work

1786
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:09,343
So is another color and

1787
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:10,367
This is just

1788
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:11,135
Annoying

1789
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:13,183
You crunch the numbers

1790
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:14,719
Hardcore

1791
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:19,071
Jesus Lugo I'm hoping he comes around with the vaccine

1792
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,351
I'm hoping

1793
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:21,631
Cheap surround himself

1794
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:23,167
Bristol Rodger Stone

1795
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:25,215
Steve Bannon

1796
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:28,287
Amgt in the restaurant

1797
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:30,079
We will come around

1798
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:32,639
The meantime we have to get behind Trump

1799
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:33,407
Milanesa

1800
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:36,479
You didn't say he was running

1801
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:48,767
Trump will come around we got the numbers we got to win this that's this Wednesday I'll promise you this

1802
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:53,375
We're not going to

1803
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:56,703
Your calls and you're going to have a place to voice your opinion in millions of people

1804
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:57,727
About what you think

1805
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:58,751
Tomorrow

1806
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:01,055
I'm going up the phones up for multiple hours

1807
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:04,383
One topic tomorrow

1808
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:06,943
Raise this issue

1809
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:10,271
Alex did you want to take calls on this subject

1810
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:16,671
You know when you live in the moment a lot of people don't really recognize

1811
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:23,071
Nice what it means to live in the moment which is to forget everything that you said earlier and put it off till tomorrow

1812
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:24,095
Blame it on other people

1813
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:28,703
So Alex has Gaston

1814
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:30,495
Instead of

1815
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:31,775
Dealing with his

1816
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:34,335
Callers Feelings by drop

1817
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:35,615
This guy

1818
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:38,175
It's only a few people out

1819
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:39,455
Exposing New World Order

1820
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,735
A greater level that idea

1821
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:42,015
Before I decide about the credit

1822
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,135
And it was

1823
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:48,159
Steve Quayle and David

1824
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:49,695
Pulse rate

1825
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:51,231
Punchbowl

1826
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:52,511
About living legends

1827
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:59,423
We got a pile of Infowars

1828
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:04,287
Steve's Man Steve kirsch's seem to fade into his sub stack background

1829
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:06,079
Steve pieczenik is still

1830
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:07,359
I got to be honest

1831
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:09,919
I need proof of Life on Steve

1832
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:10,943
I don't think I've

1833
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:13,759
I tried to find some YouTube videos

1834
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:15,551
Is channel seems dormant

1835
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:18,879
I don't know Steve's on the Wind

1836
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:19,903
I don't know

1837
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:26,303
Maybe he's happy to be involved in this b*******

1838
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:27,327
Didn't get subpoenaed

1839
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:29,631
In the trial

1840
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:34,495
That's so much to do with you really does have a lot to do with it

1841
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:39,359
Getting away scot-free on this is pretty well I mean

1842
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:40,383
Take a sexual invitation

1843
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:41,663
NFL Tampa Bay

1844
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:44,479
And you know it is it is interesting to think

1845
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:46,015
Another day if

1846
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:47,807
Steve does have health problems

1847
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:53,183
Here I think much like our boy is just going to

1848
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:56,255
We're going to be the only people who wreck

1849
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:06,239
It's going to be worth the same two people we're going to be like to think I do Steve and Alex is going to forget it was a lie Alex brought

1850
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:07,775
What up that Larry Nichols died like

1851
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:10,079
Like a couple weeks after empath

1852
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:13,919
We're the only people

1853
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:17,247
Why are you hanging out with people like that we all know it

1854
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:19,295
Damn anyway

1855
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:20,319
Steve

1856
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:23,391
Interesting thoughts

1857
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:25,951
And by interesting I mean incredibly boring

1858
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:26,975
And on hands

1859
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:28,511
People are looking

1860
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:30,047
For a political solution to a

1861
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:31,071
Spiritual problem

1862
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:32,095
It's Micah

1863
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:32,863
Contention

1864
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:33,631
Better

1865
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:34,655
United States

1866
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:36,447
Has declared the Democrats

1867
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,727
Specifically and the

1868
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:38,495
Logan horse

1869
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:39,775
I've declared war

1870
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:40,799
On God made

1871
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:41,823
Declared war on

1872
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:43,615
On everything that made our country great

1873
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:45,919
They described him as a family

1874
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:46,943
Destruction of

1875
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:49,503
How about of a Grateful Nation versus

1876
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:52,319
Basically wearing I raped

1877
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:53,599
Lenders United

1878
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:54,367
States has

1879
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,135
I've been taking

1880
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:57,439
Hey look at a ride

1881
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:58,207
Wow

1882
01:19:58,463 --> 01:20:00,511
Weird to think of the United States

1883
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:01,535
Do United

1884
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:04,863
Raping and pillaging and plundering

1885
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:08,191
Unthinkable

1886
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:09,727
I got to say

1887
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:10,495
It's fun

1888
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:13,055
To say that everybody who you don't like us

1889
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:14,592
Is declared war on God

1890
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:17,152
It's fun it's just a great thing to do

1891
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:20,224
Doesn't leave a lot of wiggle room in terms of negotiation

1892
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:23,808
Conciliation or compromise

1893
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:24,576
Be kind of

1894
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:25,344
Difficult

1895
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,928
Impossible well if you declare war on God God himself is usually pretty

1896
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:30,208
Stringent about that

1897
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:33,024
Yep dealer like War

1898
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,584
This is dumb but I do appreciate the rhyming

1899
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:36,608
And

1900
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:38,400
I think that that

1901
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:39,168
Steve Quayle

1902
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:39,936
Loki

1903
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:43,776
Is a little bit of a fanciful gentleman

1904
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:44,544
I'm being told

1905
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:46,336
Exclusive Teeter

1906
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:48,128
Your top podcast a broadcast

1907
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:49,664
Is the FAQ

1908
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:51,968
That they're already setting up

1909
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:52,736
Another

1910
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:54,016
Another

1911
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:55,296
Crypto

1912
01:20:58,624 --> 01:20:59,904
But Alex watching

1913
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:01,952
Do currencies turn into

1914
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:03,232
Tonight

1915
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:04,256
For the finance

1916
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:05,280
Actual system

1917
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:08,096
Yeah

1918
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:14,496
That is the woke Insurance of crypto jugs right that he likes wordplay and I appreciate it

1919
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:16,032
He could write a children's book

1920
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:17,312
If he wasn't nuts

1921
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:19,872
Icon

1922
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:21,152
Not Las Vegas

1923
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:27,552
I call it lost wages then come on now

1924
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:36,000
Sustiva Rambles

1925
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,072
So Steve Rambles a bit haha

1926
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:41,376
Penchant for that

1927
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:43,680
The great reset

1928
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:46,240
Get rid of that Bravo Sierra

1929
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:47,520
The greatest

1930
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,896
Because again I want to say this Alex

1931
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:54,432
Cop 2017

1932
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:55,200
Your people don't under

1933
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:57,248
But they rewrote

1934
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:58,272
The ten

1935
01:21:58,528 --> 01:22:01,344
Do a better job then

1936
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,880
Godnixon

1937
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:04,416
The creation

1938
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:07,488
Timer

1939
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:09,024
They're doing stuff behind

1940
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:12,096
The Common Man

1941
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:14,144
Good private jets

1942
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:15,936
You know 400 price

1943
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:16,704
A jet

1944
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:17,472
Going to

1945
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:19,776
Mount Sinai by the way the one they all right,

1946
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:21,056
A real one the real Mouse

1947
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:21,824
Mount Sinai

1948
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:23,872
Saudi Arabia

1949
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:29,760
Anybody said this

1950
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:31,552
Is publicly but I'm being told

1951
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,600
People that know that

1952
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:34,624
Interface

1953
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,392
That world

1954
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:37,184
That they've already decided

1955
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,976
The coming world leader is

1956
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:42,560
But this is the Christ

1957
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:44,352
Prince Charles now King Charles

1958
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:45,120
Referred to

1959
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:46,656
At that Global Summit

1960
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,192
Gentleman

1961
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:48,960
All of this

1962
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:49,984
The political

1963
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,008
Distracted

1964
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,568
Say something

1965
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:54,592
Insanity

1966
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,944
Okay so we have cop

1967
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,248
They rewrote

1968
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:06,368
At the climate conference conference

1969
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:08,416
400 private jets

1970
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:12,256
Flutamide Sinai but it's a fake mouse

1971
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:14,048
There's a lot of pictures

1972
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:16,352
Yeah

1973
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:19,936
If you bring up the point that there are 400 private jets there

1974
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:21,728
Talk to ya man of course

1975
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:25,056
It's a very stupid thing to do if you're doing the climate conference

1976
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:26,080
Real dumb

1977
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:27,872
No I don't disagree

1978
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,736
Not what we're talking about we're talking about this

1979
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:37,344
Spiritual dimension on God

1980
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:40,672
I thought the new Ten Commandments was the Georgia Guidestones

1981
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:44,000
But then I guess someone blew him up now he is got to

1982
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:48,096
Those are the old Ten Commandments ten command

1983
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:49,888
Stop is the new new new new

1984
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:53,984
Steve

1985
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,008
Taxachusetts

1986
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:58,080
Miss Rachel

1987
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:01,152
More than any other one

1988
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:03,200
How is it that the whole world

1989
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:04,992
Goes into lockdown

1990
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:06,528
At the same point how is it that the

1991
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,064
Economy shut down at the

1992
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:08,832
The same point

1993
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:10,368
And the answer is that is

1994
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:11,392
Lucy

1995
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,304
Money Wars

1996
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:19,584
Kia spirit

1997
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,144
Espy Awards

1998
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:23,680
You know people are having

1999
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:24,448
All

2000
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:26,240
Interaction

2001
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:28,544
Strange creature

2002
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,080
Sure

2003
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:31,872
Incubus succubus

2004
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:37,760
Cryptid lot of crickets

2005
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,856
I called kleptodogs cuz they feel so much Dad

2006
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:44,160
Boy

2007
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:48,256
This is the State of Affairs that we find ourselves in

2008
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:51,840
Steve Quayle warning us about chupacabras

2009
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:53,632
There's just nothing that is

2010
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:54,400
Let It Go

2011
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:55,936
You can say it for anything

2012
01:24:56,192 --> 01:25:00,288
People come up to me and ask me all the time how is it

2013
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:02,080
How is it that gas prices

2014
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:05,920
All around the world can be so high at the same time and I say

2015
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:06,944
Lucifer

2016
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:08,224
Right I mean

2017
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:14,624
This job because people wanted first of all countries didn't go into lockdown all at the same time

2018
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:16,416
Some difference but

2019
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:19,488
You could say all around the same time at

2020
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:22,048
Because there was a global pandemic

2021
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,328
I think

2022
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:24,352
That

2023
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:25,632
Is not Lucifer

2024
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:28,960
Pretty easily explainable in terms of real-world condition

2025
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:30,240
Non luciferian

2026
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:34,080
Also though they brought up Spirit Wars they're just remind everyone

2027
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:40,480
Spirit Wars where the two catchphrase ideas from reset Wars abandoned

2028
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:45,600
Not really expanded upon a combination of his most important thing he's ever done

2029
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:52,000
Which flopped and was really just a contract thing that he did for a weirdo get-rich-quick hypnotist a fella that Alex has

2030
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:54,816
Mentioned he did a photoshoot Creek

2031
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:55,840
So

2032
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:59,424
Contributed quite a bit dog

2033
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:02,240
The most important luxury Deanna Creek

2034
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,800
So Cryptids

2035
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:05,824
Chair out there

2036
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:06,848
Cryptids during play

2037
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:08,384
Sasquatch

2038
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:09,408
The squatters

2039
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:12,224
What are the Cryptids

2040
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,016
Do you like another Mothman

2041
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:17,856
Much as I love

2042
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:21,696
I was always I was always

2043
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:27,584
Mister myxlplyx what's the Abomination Abomination what's the Snowman

2044
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,352
Yes

2045
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:29,376
The yetis

2046
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:32,960
Sure

2047
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:39,360
It's just a different environment

2048
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:45,504
How about you I don't like Cryptids much so I don't find them

2049
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:49,600
Not a guy what are you what are you you like Messi

2050
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:56,000
That's just because I feel like nothing is not coming out of the water between the two of you

2051
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:57,536
A long-standing respect

2052
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:59,072
4 things better in the water

2053
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:00,864
Check domain

2054
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,912
It's a different domain

2055
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:09,312
Whatever you all are doing over there I respect you right in the water keep it in the water

2056
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:12,384
Already be right right come in and out of the water

2057
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:18,784
Don't trust the other ticket late

2058
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:21,856
Sure

2059
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:23,904
They're not hurting anybody that's fine

2060
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:24,928
Toads are pretty cool

2061
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:26,208
Yeah except for the ones that are poised

2062
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:28,512
Right but you can lick some of the other ones

2063
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,304
I'm not going to get into

2064
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:35,168
I like to swim in the water

2065
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:37,216
It's true I'm not going to I'm not going to bother

2066
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:41,312
We are just I'm a traveler in the waters right I don't mind if

2067
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:42,080
You're a guest

2068
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:44,640
For a frog

2069
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:46,176
Hops around

2070
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:49,504
That's fine

2071
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:54,368
You get like an alligator or something like that that's a dinosaur in the water

2072
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:58,720
Water more than a million years old

2073
01:27:58,976 --> 01:27:59,488
Buckeye

2074
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:01,792
I'm done

2075
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:04,096
I think we'd get along

2076
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:06,656
So we have one last one

2077
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,192
Comeback

2078
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:14,080
Situation in Russia

2079
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:19,968
Little break

2080
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:23,040
Don't do this a lot of prayer

2081
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:26,368
So Steve has a little prayer

2082
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:27,648
You know honestly

2083
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:29,696
If God's the answer

2084
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:32,000
By then why is

2085
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:33,536
Steve answering all these

2086
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:34,560
These questions with Lucy

2087
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:36,608
Great question

2088
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:37,888
I don't have an answer

2089
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:44,288
That

2090
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:48,128
Would still be blaming Russia even if it was a surface-to-air missile that was launched

2091
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:50,944
Buy Ukraine that way is because they wouldn't

2092
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:57,344
I've been watching that if Russia wasn't firing missiles so there is still an argument to be made that hey at the end of the day

2093
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,904
Day Russia still bear some responsibility

2094
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:00,672
Circumstance

2095
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:06,560
But Alex doesn't care about that out for a joyride with our missile is just

2096
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:12,960
We let's fire them willy-nilly into the sky know we're being attacked by a nation that

2097
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:13,984
He's trying to kill us

2098
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:20,128
With no interest in really fighting a war anymore that is the rationale there if you're curious out

2099
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:24,736
Steve is so uncompelling that these are the clips that I have

2100
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:25,504
Of him

2101
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:29,344
The declare war on God Cryptids are out and about

2102
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:38,304
Don't paper those should be good at all available everybody Cryptid

2103
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:41,120
Except for sport play which is nice

2104
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:43,680
I do I do appreciate that Alex

2105
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:46,240
Has the Trump announces his can

2106
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:49,568
Mediately starts waffling back

2107
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:51,360
To like all right I support Trump

2108
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:53,152
Yeah I know there's if there's a bear

2109
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:54,432
Very clear indication of it

2110
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:55,200
Except

2111
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:56,224
To take calls about it

2112
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:02,624
Can't handle having these conversations interview with Steve Quayle

2113
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:04,672
Is just

2114
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:06,976
Gross piece of s***

2115
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:08,256
About medical leave

2116
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:10,560
Suicide

2117
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:14,144
If I'm Trump if I'm Trump if even on Infowars

2118
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,448
Is my candidacy announcement goes over like

2119
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:17,216
Make a fart

2120
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:18,752
It's not good

2121
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:20,288
It's not good no

2122
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:26,432
Nono and the worst part is I cried about how he would die for you last time

2123
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:32,832
He doesn't want to talk about it doesn't want to talk about it would rather hang out and pray with Steve Quayle

2124
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:33,600
Here's what

2125
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:36,672
Trump over the pain the pandemic

2126
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:38,720
Everybody watch Great British baking

2127
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:44,608
Michelle we prefer nice reality TV shows to shity reality TV shows now it's just how it were

2128
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:45,888
Well I mean if you want to

2129
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:47,424
Actually going to use the bank

2130
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:54,336
I would say that his announcement speech was a little rough and ready

2131
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:58,944
I like that flying too much

2132
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:02,528
The British being able to use that

2133
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:08,928
Yeah I do I do I just like to say rough puff pastry that's what I I just talked to him every time

2134
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:13,280
Place a rough puff pastry oh my God so it's so it feels good rolling off the tongue

2135
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:17,888
I am waiting the finale of

2136
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:19,936
Oh yeah yeah

2137
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:21,728
It is in Britain

2138
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:25,824
But not in the United States oboy you would have to use some sort of

2139
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,616
VPN

2140
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:28,384
Yeah

2141
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:29,408
Might have to look into that

2142
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:35,808
The show I like Sandro Sandra

2143
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:42,208
He's a big muscle is funny he smart

2144
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:45,792
Damn my God what we are in love

2145
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:49,376
With my pups jump up and

2146
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:51,680
Not too much going on tour

2147
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:53,472
He doesn't need this

2148
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:56,800
What's the problem

2149
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:57,568
Anyway

2150
01:31:57,824 --> 01:32:00,896
Jordan become to the end of this Earth to quote myself

2151
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:03,200
Going to f*** the f***

2152
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:06,784
I will be back for another episode

2153
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:16,256
Yeah

2154
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:23,424
I got excited there because I realize that Steve Quayle is the person who warns us about

2155
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:25,728
The sex robot

2156
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:28,032
Holding

2157
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:33,664
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work
