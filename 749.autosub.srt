00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,792
Call Joseph

6
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,632
We are Damned

7
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,496
What are you doing

8
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:20,384
My bright spot Dan is that recently I I believe it might even be out

9
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,456
Today I was a guest on vgod pod

10
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:31,136
I feel like it.

11
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:34,208
The cult leader who prophesied

12
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:39,584
Currently living out like a Twilight Zone dream version of like hey man here's what you'll here's what will happen

13
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,376
You think he's going to talk to God

14
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,656
Wrong

15
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,448
He's going to go on the podcast

16
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:50,848
Video podcast

17
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:56,992
At the at the risk of sounding like the lead singer of Dishwalla

18
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,856
That was fun

19
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:05,952
Psyche and Satan into the literal Chris

20
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,232
Double was there as great as

V-neck Happy Meals I believe

24

I will be damned

31
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:31,808
Because I didn't go on yes that is true that is true I would say that my my bright spot today Jordan age

00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,832
Lee

33
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:36,416
Over in the UK just got a little dizzy

34
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,696
Package aha

35
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:43,840
Can be very very much appreciate it

36
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,888
And a giant thing of hobnob

37
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,448
Switch famously on the streets

38
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,776
My favorite of the British trade

39
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,848
I I will say that I don't know if I can

40
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,128
Can forgive them for this

41
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,152
12 months

42
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:03,552
Matured Christmas party at what happened when I opened the package month mature what happened what happened

43
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,880
He open the package and he said it is candy dumbass

44
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:13,280
Cuz it's labeled fragile

45
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:19,168
Obviously with candy and then you just handed me a 12 Church Christmas pudding

46
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,448
This one's for you and your wife

47
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:25,568
Andre Brandi mini pies I will

48
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:30,944
I will take one for the team and have all the candy

49
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,736
The 12-month matured

50
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,528
Oh boy

51
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,808
That's right up

52
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,832
Jordan

53
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,904
Today we are time-traveling I felt

54
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,672
The urge

55
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,720
To go back to the past

56
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,792
Every now and again you need a re-up

57
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,584
You need to go back

58
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,608
I can get a taste of what

59
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,144
What things used to be like

60
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,984
And like I mentioned on our last episode we I got bored

61
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,312
Of the August timeframe

62
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,104
The December

63
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,408
Strategic decision on my part

64
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,712
December 2000

65
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,016
3 is when Saddam Hussein at the beach

66
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:11,392
That's right and so I would love to see the lead up to that and how Alex

67
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,160
Respond

68
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,184
When Saddam

69
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,512
Because as we know Alec believes that he's in Belarus

70
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:20,351
With his kids and a bunch of gold very alive

71
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,143
He believes are there

72
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,703
So we will get to that way

73
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,239
Do that but for now weird

74
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,519
Checking in on

75
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,543
December 1st

76
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:34,943
Seeing what the path leads us to

77
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,991
3 +

78
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,271
I'm going to just

79
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,343
Give a little bit of a

80
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,903
It's not a warning but I'm going to be a little bit of

81
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,927
It was shorter episode

82
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,255
But the reality is something that we talked about it

83
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,279
I think is actually very

84
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,815
Cancel

85
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,887
I don't know we might hit an hour we might not

86
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,935
But I do think

87
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,703
That this is

88
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,239
Something that

89
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,543
Something that happens is definitely like

90
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,359
I can't believe this it's about

91
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,151
Quality of minute now

92
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:11,551
What we we've been doing for our episodes we've been doing all that stuff we got that under our belts now

93
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,575
It's about minutes

94
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,855
Quality right now

95
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:20,255
I talked about passing out on Direct

96
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:27,423
Condensing of Doubt or getting from efficiency that's Argo I don't know if you want me to put your business on the streets but I know that

97
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:32,287
Getting back into stand-up a little I didn't know if you have closely regarding that

98
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,335
I know that

99
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,871
A minute is a very important

100
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,663
That's what that is

101
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,711
That that I know that you're

102
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
Tracking rate

103
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,247
I've always

104
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:47,647
Permitted guy you know cuz I have those jokes that last two or three minutes with only one

105
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,463
Wayla

106
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:56,863
Play love under one under one is not a good last-minute I've been told that many a Time

107
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:01,471
I never really I never attract that and I never really understood like how do you gauge

108
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,543
Like what is and is not a successful laugh

109
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:08,383
Yeah like what if you get a couple people laughing in the audience but really hard

110
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,735
Just a good-sized laugh from everybody

111
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:18,111
Do the each count as one I mean who's got the meat the audio make the decibel meter has

112
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,903
I think it all every

113
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:25,023
Part of it became incredibly stupid to me after I listen to Dana Gould Black Dahlia B

114
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,791
That

115
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,583
5-minute long bed

116
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,351
With one

117
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,119
Punchline

118
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:34,495
Is so spectacular he's got you hanging on every word and then the final punch

119
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,567
Breaks everything open the whole place explodes

120
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,895
It's perfect for the Jon Glaser and Jon Benjamin

121
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,199
Forget about it

122
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:47,039
Hidden Siri has one joke with him twenty something

123
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:51,391
There was a by Jon Benjamin

124
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,927
Was the

125
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,719
David CrossFit that they did

126
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,999
The abortion doctor

127
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:59,327
No the comedians of Comedy Tour they did or not

128
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:03,935
I want they did a one-off. I don't remember what that bit was they both

129
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,703
Recorded this

130
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,751
Long thing where they started

131
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:12,895
Leaving the stage and then talking to a recording of the other ostensibly because they were at that's right

132
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,431
What are you doing back at the train

133
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,527
Forever the two of them had a bit on the invite them up

134
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:24,927
CD that was David Cross was a doctor who would put babies back inside

135
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:31,583
If it was interview him and fortified by the procedure

136
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,607
So good

137
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,143
Anyway

138
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,703
We have an episode to do but before that

139
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,799
Let's take a look

140
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:47,455

Next

151
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,335
This was actually inspired by today

152
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:19,199
Ironically they sent this in Pryor but it is actually in response

153
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,735
What's the today's episode

154
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:25,599

George Soros in a hot tub we call that globalist warming thank you so much

161
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,383
You are now what time

162
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,919
I'm a policy wonk

163
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
I have

164
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,967
Risen above

165
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,015
My enemies

166
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,903
A little breaking for me

167
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,487
And then we're going to come back

168
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,559
And I'm going to start the show over

169
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,679

I got plenty of words for you but at the end of the day

172
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,567
F*** you and your new world order

173
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,615

174
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,151
And all your s***

175
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,687
Maybe later on West Broad

176
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,759
Maybe I'll just be gone a month maybe 5 years

177
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,575
Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow

178
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,111
And you never see me again

179
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,415
That's really what I want to do

180
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,719
Everyone come back here again

181
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,255
Apologize to

182
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,303
Yesterday that I

183
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:41,375
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

184
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
I'll be better tomorrow

185
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:43,935
He's not

186
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:48,543
Not even in the past December 2003 still not good not

187
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,567
Not good

188
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:55,711
Before we get to today's episode I wanted to touch on something from our last episode

189
00:09:55,967 --> 00:10:01,599
And that is a we talked about Alex's coverage of the medical assistance in dying legislation in Canada

190
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,391
And I wanted to loop back in touch

191
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,671
Back on that here a little bit

192
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,951
Before we we launch

193
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,719
Directions to two

194
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:11,839
I don't believe that we said anything that I disagree with necessarily in hindsight but I did

195
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:17,215
Get the messages from listeners that have been really helpful in terms of illustrating ways that we could have discussed that issue better

196
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,495
And from a broader /

197
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,263
Perspective

198
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:25,919
1 points we could have done a better job of stressing is that there is an inadequate social safety net in terms of support

199
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,967
For people living with disabilities in Canada

200
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:32,319
And this is a very severe issue when it comes to the point where poverty ends up being a

201
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,111
A contributing factor towards someone wanting

202
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,135
SuperSU made

203
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:41,791
The case of Amir fursuit who we discussed on the last episode involved that Dynamic where his disability payments weren't enough

204
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:45,375
Keep him out of poverty and weren't enough to allow me to find a place to live

205
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,703
Which would leave him living with severe pain on house

206
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:53,055
We did talk about how his case illustrates the need for greater social welfare but

207
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:59,455
I wasn't really aware of the endemic problem that Advocates around disability-related issues have been raising around the intersection of

208
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,735
Poverty and disability

209
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,807
And how this makes the expansion of made to include people whose deaths

210
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,599
Reasonably imminent

211
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,647
Contribute towards a program that's

212
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,671
Dangerously close to

213
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
Eugenics

214
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,487
This is really important stuff

215
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:16,095
And I'd like to learn more about it and possibly talk to someone who knows more in the future

216
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:19,423
My coverage of Alex is content on the subject has attended

217
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,471
Z2 sometimes not see all of

218
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,495
The broader context

219
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,775
Implications of a story

220
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,055
Because I'm looking at what he

221
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,847
He's saying and then evaluating that

222
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,639
AB apologies for not stressing

223
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:33,247
Some of the more important aspect of what rational people's complaints about maydak

224
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
Actually are

225
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,319
There's a real critique

226
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,367
Critique

227
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,135
Kissing on the Alex

228
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,415
Critique and sometimes

229
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,695
That means

230
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
I don't

231
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
See

232
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,559
Some of the more reasonable criticism

233
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,863
Yeah it's hard to it's hard to

234
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,983
Completely view an issue in a rational perspective when somebody is also screaming like

235
00:11:54,239 --> 00:12:00,383
You shouldn't do that I don't even understand how I'm supposed to

236
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,223
That's the challenge and some of that is just miss something

237
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,039
Things sometimes that being said I do think that

238
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:13,439
Some of our conversation was surrounding the question of how social safety

239
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,743
And Welfare programs

240
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:20,351
Would be a solution to some of the confounding factors

241
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,167
That that were discussed in these cases though

242
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,215
I think we could have done a better job of

243
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,007
Highlighting and and focus

244
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,287
Kissing in on

245
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
Some of those problem

246
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:36,223
Now the second problem which action think is a bit bigger is that there have been some reported cases of people with disabilities being off

247
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:36,991
Offered made

248
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,783
Has opposed to them pursuing

249
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,343
Further Canadian laws have not

250
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:46,719
Built-in oversight and regulations that many feel would be needed to make sure that that kind of care

251
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,767
His being applied responsibly

252
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,791
And that's a really big

253
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,559
Concern

254
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:55,167
I do think that Advocates and human rights experts have a valid point when they say that this Ledger

255
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,959
Translation does have the potential to have a d

256
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,983
Dehumanizing effect

257
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,263
People with disabilities

258
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,287
And in essence

259
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:04,383
Create a perception weather in the mind of the public or in the medical profession

260
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,943
That their lives are somehow less worth living

261
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,223
And that is definitely

262
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:08,991
The unacceptable

263
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:13,343
I'm not sure what the answer is but I'm going to read more up on this and try to listen

264
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,111
The folks with butter

265
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:14,879
Perspective

266
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,439
But I am confident in my opposition to Alex

267
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,463
This coverage of the story

268
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,535
The takeaway that I have is that there are more reason

269
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,863
Wants to take this seriously and that Alex Alex's coverage

270
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,399
The cartoonish version of

271
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
The problem

272
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,471
And exist in direct opposition to the

273
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,775
Most logical Elementary solution

274
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,567
To helping some parts of this

275
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,615
Is greater social investment didn't

276
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,639
Lifting people out of Pop

277
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:43,295
I Am So for anybody who took issue with some of our commentary I do apologize that there was a

278
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
A slice of this

279
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,855
Intersection of it that that way

280
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:53,279
And I hope to do better job of being mindful of a lot of that stuff in future insta

281
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,351
We do our best and then if we don't

282
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:59,167
Best we listen when people tell us we did

283
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,959
Drive to

284
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:02,751
Jordan

285
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,031
Today December

286
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,079
First is where we're starting

287
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,359
It's episodes

288
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,663
There's nothing going on

289
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,455
December 1st but it's the

290
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,479
First day of

291
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,247
December

292
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,039
2003

293
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,831
There was so much going on

294
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,903
There was

295
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,695
The first hour of Left Behind

296
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:26,815
The first hour of the show is mostly just Alex being mad that bush went to Iraq

297
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,839
Back to give out

298
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,119
Do use for Thanksgiving

299
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,959
Oh yeah I remember that one but there's just a lot of that

300
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,495
That's the vibe you get

301
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:38,847
Water and complain about turkey

302
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:39,871
Yeah yeah

303
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,663
We think about all the Absurd

304
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,967
Things and insane things that Trump did

305
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:50,367
Because they were all so terrified on October towels

306
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,391
In a weird way

307
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:56,255
You know throwing up paper towels was condescending and f***** up and and Olaf

308
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,791
Infantilizing

309
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:03,679
Boys going to the place that he genocided and giving out turkeys for a genocide holiday

310
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:08,543
That's that's metaphorically more f***** up and I can take care of that's an onion of

311
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,359
So we have a

312
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,127
Couple clip

313
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:12,895
December

314
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,175
There's not much

315
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,967
To discuss here but

316
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:20,063
Go to check in every now and again see how Alex feels about

317
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,343
Various

318
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,135
Right-wing figures sure

319
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:26,463
You still hate Michael Savage

320
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:33,119
Also has a lot about people calling him and his friends.

321
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,935
Please and you shouldn't do that

322
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,239
Well I mean when it comes to Michael Savage

323
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,119
George Bush

324
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:14,335
Martial Law's good

325
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,663
Nazis and Michael Savage

326
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:22,527
On the hour every hour thing everybody has to go to a forced labor camp

327
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:26,623
There is the station check you got to do

328
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,391
Time is it

329
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:31,999
Time and temp for sure traffic traffic

330
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
I meant of course

331
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:36,095
You got to remind people that if you speak out against the government you split movie

332
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,191
What's his regular boarding zoocrew Michael Savage sucks

333
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:44,031
But even this is a little bit unfair to to the depictions of him

334
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,311
You alright man

335
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:53,247
It's just funny though because later on Alex will be like Michael Savage was a while Pioneer one of the first in this space and

336
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:57,855
Hero in a legend

337
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:03,487
Well and Alex Michael Savage started

338
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,655
I got a text either Legend

Bake a cake for a mother

Criminal

371
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,743
Call Charles

372
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:45,119
So I suspect the cops are more affected by Alex's earlier documentaries because those films are kind of

373
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,399
Veiled threats against

374
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,167
The police

375
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,519
There's actually arguing that the police are the strong arm of the globalist and will be used

376
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,335
Enslave the population and thus will be the pay

377
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,359
Patriots anime

378
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,919
Unless they're explicitly on the side of

379
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,687
The Patriots

380
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:02,527
The message is essentially when things go bad we will kill you

381
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,807
You unless you're on our side

382
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,879
It's the same messaging in a ton of militiamen

383
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,159
Princeton

384
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,463
The book unintended consequences involved

385
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,255
The plot to assassinate law enforcement

386
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,815
Mike carried out by Patriots who had enough of gun-grabbing

387
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,375
This isn't necessarily will you call a direct

388
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:21,471
Sprint but it also definitely has an undertone in these materials

389
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,263
It might seem to help

390
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,567
Explain why they resonate so strongly with

391
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,335
The people in lawn

392
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:32,735
They're more or less telling any of you were a law enforcement that there is a war coming that the Patriots will win

393
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:35,039
And they need to decide if they want to be one of the good guys

394
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,319
Or they want to die as a v

395
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:41,695
You know it's a very emotional appeals is made in those documentaries 2

396
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,975
You could see

397
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:48,607
Your cop you might identify with people being labeled a villain

398
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,399
Sure

399
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,167
I mean

400
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,191
If it was

401
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,727
If I had a time machine

402
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:58,335
Right now I would go back and tell everybody to be like

403
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,359
Do you hear this

404
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:03,199
The cops like Alex Jones do you not understand what's going to happen soon

405
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:05,247
Cops like Alex Jones

406
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,015
Tampa

407
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,575
Problem with that is you listen to this and Alex

408
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,599
Is a liar

409
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,415
So it's really easy to like

410
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,183
Hear this

411
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,511
Just blowing smoke about cops loving his stuff

412
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:19,839
But maybe there was more truth to that Fender a surly

413
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,887
We're comfortable with

414
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:24,447
You know those documentaries

415
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,727
Isn't that way that he would

416
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,567
I don't know what it would be like to be a cop

417
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,103
Then getting this stuff

418
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,175
Cuz this is cuz he was sending those two cops

419
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,223
The guy was starting to send those to the cops

420
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,527
Around 1999 so this is

421
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,831
A decade after 9/11

422
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,903
Yeah pretty 911 but after OKC

423
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,695
Yeah so we're in that

424
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:50,047
Uncertainty zone of who the bad terrorists are

425
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,071
So the cops

426
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:55,423
I've got to be in this weird no-man's-land where they like we want to but they don't know who

427
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,727
So I assume this is how it goes bad

428
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,055
I ate it may be a contributing factor could be

429
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,663
December 1st

430
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,199
This is when we

431
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,223
Talked about

432
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,759
Alex is war

433
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,831
Glenn Greenwald interview I

434
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,367
Said on the episode

435
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,696
F****** liar his dad was in the John Birch Society

436
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,720
And like

437
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,768
Because in the film eat rice

438
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:25,632
Presenting self is just like oh I had some of these influences our round or whatever to know you

439
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,424
You're in a birch f****** household

440
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,824
Yeah and I got some pushback on Twitter even from some folks who have

441
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,360
Who aren't ramdump

442
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:41,248
People interested say and so I just want to play this just to reiterate that Alex's dad was in the jobbers

443
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,624
How you doing Alex

444
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,672
I want to dance

445
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,976
Your thoughts

446
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,256
John Birch

447
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,304
I know you said you

448
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,328
Your dad was on

449
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,144
Questions

450
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,016
Great membership

451
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:30,912
Great great so another thing that's in there is that

452
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,936
Alex thinks that

453
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:36,288
The John Birch Society isn't aggressive week-to-week they don't

454
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:39,360
They don't say it they don't go hard

455
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:42,944
This to me is so in line with

456
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,224
That

457
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:49,856
Illusion that people had about Alex not being right-wing cuz he criticizes bush

458
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,624
Diseases

459
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,904
To either communist

460
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,488
Criticized

461
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:58,816
The John Birch Society

462
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:05,216
That's very shiny know I'm putting together this Library I've been reading some of these materials

463
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,776
They're they're insanely aggressive

464
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:10,080
DIY grow

465
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:15,200
So anyway let's put that baby to bed go to December 2nd

466
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,248
Episode

467
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,552
Alex announces

468
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:23,904
Sometimes I think you're going to the pass just because somebody said that something happened on the past

469
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,672
Sitting here like

470
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,208
Walking Dead

471
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,352
I am in both the past and the present

472
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,144
So Alex has a

473
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,680
But he announces on the side

474
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,984
Listening without necessarily ring out

475
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,008
Talk to you but this

476
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,056
Is a f****** huge problem

477
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,416
Who has

478
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,656
So are costume and wrote a book

479
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,192
Book titled painful question

480
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,240
Jensen analysis of the September 11th

481
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,264
Attack which hasn't

482
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,544
Held up well as time

483
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,312
What's going on

484
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,360
Hey there's a theme with 9/11 conspiracy

485
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,640
Vista particularly from the

486
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,664
Early-stage

487
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,248
However this is not what I find interesting or troubling

488
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,272
About Eric Holcomb

489
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,832
As long as aggressive anti-semitism

490
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,368
Far more important

491
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,416
Oso a problem

492
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,696
Problem is not a crow

493
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:32,256
He's not to be pretty eyeglass pretty

494
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,584
Schmidt has a YouTube channel

495
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,448
Of his Public Access TV interviews and also a clip from the movie A Bug's Life

496
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,984
Which she claims is allegory

497
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:47,360
The Jews or in his room designer star the Grasshoppers and they non-jews are the ants

498
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,664
His description of the video reads

499
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:53,248
From the movie A Bug's Life the leader of the grasshoppers

500
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,576
Nazi scientist explain what happened at the stupid

501
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,880
Spread these goyim where to realize

502
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,440
But they don't have to be under the control of the grasshopper

503
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,816
For some reason around 2009 is channel shifted over to some recipes and cooking

504
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,864
Content and then two videos of bugs

505
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,168
I'm sort of curious about this but

506
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:11,936
It seems like

507
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,216
It's not a mystery worth solving

508
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,496
So I left it alone

509
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,032
He's a big

510
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,312
Time Zionist

511
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,592
Occupied government type

512
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:22,688
Conspiracist and that's his underlying theory about 9/11

513
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,040
I found a page under the name Erica Schmidt on the site Clippy

514
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,344
Which seemed like

515
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:34,464
There's some pretty offensive content on it but it wasn't sure if I was going to use it for this episode

516
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,024
On the off chance that it wasn't this guy's pay

517
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,792
Pager

518
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:41,376
However I was able to satisfy my own doubts by doing a little bit of crossword

519
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,912
Princeton

520
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,216
To the audio clips he's posted on that page

521
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,496
About Carly Fran

522
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:50,848
A woman who has made allegations about being ritualistically abused by the Masons

523
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,664
Incidentally on his own website

524
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,456
Huge questions.com

525
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:57,760
Eric routinely talk about France

526
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,040
And her allegation

527
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:03,392
Because I was able to find overlaps like this I'm pretty confident

528
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:05,952
The business is audio page actually know for sure it is

529
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,976
So that means

530
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,280
I'm going to play this anti-semitic trash

531
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:13,632
Cash for you for this because this is going to blow your mind

532
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,192
Choose headband

533
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:16,960
Nicely

534
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,008
We would love

535
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,800
It's their own fault

536
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:59,200
This song is over 5 minutes long but I think you get the idea there

537
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,992
That sounds like a

538
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,016
It's from the f******

539
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:05,344
Firefly unit like it you would cuz you would go into a

540
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,744
Spacebar I did they would be playing this propaganda theme song while you were gay Cantina

541
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:15,328
Yeah we're booked with in under a minute

542
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:21,728
He's growing into blood libel

543
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,800
Band that is so fun

544
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:25,568
Locked up

545
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:29,152
I feel like there is there is a

546
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:31,968
Who made

547
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:32,736
Did he

548
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:38,624
Did he do that himself I suspect you did cuz I have to the beginning is him

549
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,904
It continues throughout the song

550
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,696
Because of that I wanted to just

551
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,512
Include a few more things that he says of this song

552
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,328
Border on calling for genocide

553
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,008
The Jews are getting away with a lot of the times partly because most people can't believe

554
00:27:55,264 --> 00:28:01,408
Maybe they're not the same

555
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:06,528
You claim to be A different race and they may be correct.

556
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,576
Suggestion that Jewish people are human

557
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,880
That's not good but Jordan

558
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,672
Gets worse

559
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:19,072
All throughout history is that every society treated use with decency and respect

560
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:25,472
Got tired of the abuse Prime murders

561
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:31,872
Horrible Behavior

562
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:48,512
Decided to refuse the German

563
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,400
And check out that box

564
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,168
What's the weather tomorrow

565
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,728
Claiming the Holocaust was the Jews fault

566
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:04,128
Covering a lot of bases here hopsmith II you know I saw the movie Clockwork Orange

567
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:04,896
Way2go

568
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,432
I was like

569
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,712
8 when I saw it

570
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:12,832
Cuz it was an accidental thing that was on TV late at night for some reason

571
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,624
And

572
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,392
You know that

573
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:21,792
Scene where he's got the Beethoven playing was got the horrific images and

574
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:27,424
That's horrific I can't imagine what that would feel like kind of like what the fuc

575
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:33,824
What you just played for me I finally am like all I got Clockwork Orange

576
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:36,384
Too far away for you to hit pause on it

577
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,944
Absolutely

578
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,480
Chords would rip out we.

579
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,040
Start all over I mean this is just

580
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,064
Bad

581
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,344
Horrendous

582
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,112
Yeah

583
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,648
We have to get to the

584
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:50,720
Crescendo's oh so here is the here's the last clip of his song

585
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:57,632
Let's imagine what the 20th century might have been like that the Jews have instigated all of these wars and

586
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:03,008
Terrorist attacks us imagine a world without these stuff disgusting

587
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,104
Actually suggesting that a world without Jews would be a better word

588
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,688
World and essentially he's making an argument in favor of extermination

589
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,296
This is one of the most blunt pieces of content I've seen one of Alex's gas

590
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,064
Produced

591
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:16,832
And the fact that it's

592
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:21,440
Delivered with a shity techno song just makes things

593
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,512
A little bit less

594
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,816
DJ Dan artinya

595
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,096
No

596
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:33,472
I even regret bringing up his name is Scott. I'm sorry I'm sorry

597
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:37,568
Anyway that's the guy who Alex has on his show to talk

598
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,848
Talk about 9/11

599
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,664
You may have noticed that the line 911

600
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:48,064
Just the start is in that really anti-semitic songs on Alex's part

601
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,648
Unless you trying to do a Nazi show in that case is a great call

602
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,184
Call good-looking welsey

603
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,720
The thing about Michael Savage

604
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,256
Is it was all the thought

605
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,560
What's Nazis Alex is going for the thought

606
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:01,632
Full Nazi riot

607
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:04,192
I'm going to hold the door open for you. Kind of nut

608
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:09,568
Also this episode December 2003 and by his earliest 2007

609
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:13,152
Schmidt it turned on Alex and decided that he was working for the Jewish cabal

610
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:16,736
In addition to being inoffensive and meritless gas

611
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:20,832
This is also something Alex should look back on with personal embarrassment

612
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:26,976
Here he is elevating the sapphire of a lunatic bigot who by his own devices probably tops out at about

613
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,768
Being interviewed on public access

614
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,560
Amanda is giving him

615
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,096
The credibility that he will do

616
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,632
Just be attacked with later

617
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:36,192
When Eric Schmidt finds out that Alex

618
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,472
His wife is Jewish

619
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,496
So

620
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,032
Pac-Man

621
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,568
Man man

622
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,848
Man

623
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,640
Ii-vi

624
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,408
Just me

625
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,432
I think

626
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,456
That

627
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,224
Once you

628
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,272
Thought your way into being like

629
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,576
Ocu be better if they're just weren't any of those

630
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,112
You're in a bad place

631
00:31:54,368 --> 00:32:00,256
Totally here in a bad place totally except if you're talkin about Christmas pudding

632
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:02,304
But you unfortunately Napa

633
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,096
We can always

634
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,888
So you know I feel

635
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,424
I think that there's a lot of people

636
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,240
Who are under the notion

637
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,520
The Alex's show in

638
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:16,640
In the past used to not be as Extreme as it was as it maybe now or something

639
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:19,456
Easy perception to have because

640
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:22,016
There's a story if it's written about Alex

641
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,040
Pasta

642
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:25,088
It's a story that

643
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,648
The only people generally who have any awareness

644
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,672
It was like

645
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,952
Are people who love Alec

646
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,720
What's an arc going

647
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,536
Going to necessarily pushback on the narrative

648
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,584
And also

649
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,352
Because

650
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:39,936
I don't know maybe Eric hubschmitt knows what he's doing

651
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:45,312
He doesn't yell about the Jews on Alex's show

652
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,592
Crypto Alamance

653
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:49,408
Do the conversation that they're having about 9/11

654
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,688
And

655
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,968
If you just list

656
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,248
Listen to this uncritically

657
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,040
Then you just pick up this guy thing

658
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,600
Lakes that their buildings are blown up or whatever

659
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,416
When in reality what Alex is doing is

660
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:05,024
Mainstreaming elevating and normalizing somebody who's

661
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,072
Essentially blaming

662
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:07,840
Jewish be

663
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,632
People for 9/11

664
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,400
And

665
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,192
On the back of that

666
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,472
Rationalizing

667
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:16,288
Hey an argument for extermination

668
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,568
Delivered a techno song

669
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,104
So I

670
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,640
Think of this show is about as bad as a

671
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,688
Really in the past

672
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,736
Yeah it is it is

673
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:28,320
There's no way that he can't not know that he's

674
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,088
Got

675
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,368
Massive anti-Semitic

676
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,416
Let's let me know

677
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,440
Let's tease that out

678
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:35,744
Is it possible Maybe

679
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,560
He doesn't have that you okay

680
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,632
Maybe you'd possibly possible Alex doesn't know

681
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,424
That he wants to exterminate

682
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:50,080
Let's explore the possibility that Alex actually doesn't even know that this guy has

683
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,104
Is deeply a smell

684
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:54,944
So what does can't reveal it reviews

685
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:58,016
A complete application of responsibility to

686
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,040
Is that your gas egg

687
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,064
At bat

688
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,344
That's what we have

689
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:02,880
At best

690
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,160
Alex is

691
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,184
Platforming

692
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:05,952
And

693
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,024
I mean quite frankly

694
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,560
Advocating people

695
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,328
Support

696
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,864
Nothing

697
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,424
Because he didn't want to do his job and figure out who he's talk

698
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,496
And that's probably bad

699
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,056
Play Bad

700
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,872
No that's why that's why it's so

701
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,432
It was the first thought I had was like oh well that's why you

702
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,968
Your guests and then the problem was

703
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:29,504
I8

704
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,808
Whether or not they vetted him or not

705
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:34,368
Still could have gone either direction

706
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,672
You know they could have added him and being like hey

707
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,720
So long as you don't say the juice stuff

708
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:42,048
Will use you on their 911 episode for sure

709
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:46,400
Or they could have not better them and been like well let's just hope he doesn't

710
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:49,472
Reveal that he's a complete and total Nazi you know

711
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,752
But

712
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:54,336
Even as somebody who is an expert

713
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,896
And Alex Jones and his listen to all this s***

714
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,480
I can't really say for sure right

715
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:01,504
Like I think

716
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:07,648
The laziness argument is more compelling

717
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:11,744
After the fact

718
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:18,656
Yeah I think that at a certain point the

719
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,704
The argument for that

720
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,240
Laziness

721
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,776
Naivete or whatever

722
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,056
Kind of is more difficult

723
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,080
The support given the

724
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,872
The trends in the app

725
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,432
Aggressive support of

726
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,784
Hutton Gibson and

727
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:37,344
There's some problems

728
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,624
How come it would agree that

729
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,416
Message ABS didn't go far enough

730
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,208
A Synchro actually thanks for the

731
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,256
The JBS is partially run by

732
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:46,816
The Jewish cabal and their there

733
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:50,144
Paint on it along with Alex Jones and sharply and

734
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,448
Basically everyone he's just lonely

735
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,240
And he's watching his

736
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,008
That's why he's

737
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:57,312
Posted all this bug videos on YouTube now

738
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,616
We're going to talk about as long as it's here in a little bit

739
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,384
Yeah

740
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,944
So Alex intros

741
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,016
Bad

742
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,368
Computer programmer

743
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,648
Join Josh

744
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,672
Author

745
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,536
Waking up a lot of pee

746
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:18,560
The process

747
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,840
Waking them up

748
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:20,608
To what

749
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,632
Yeah

750
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,912
That is

751
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,448
Horton Quest

752
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,264
You question

753
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,544
So how Nazism is

754
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,824
That's what he's Wiki

755
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:33,664
No I don't I don't think he is I don't think so either

756
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:36,736
I think he's going to Public Access shows and

757
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:37,504
Now getting

758
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,576
Call up to the big leagues with Alex

759
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:43,136
Inevitably the

760
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,184
The waking up

761
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,232
Waking up is this

762
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,536
It's seen as this Universal good

763
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,072
Or whatever

764
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:51,840
And

765
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,120
Unfortunately

766
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:53,888
It's not

767
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:57,216
The waking up metaphor isn't good

768
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,520
It's not actually waking up

769
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:02,336
Shifting your

770
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,360
Active or something

771
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,224
You know what Alex is saying is this guy's waking people up and what he's actually saying is

772
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,016
He's shifting people

773
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,296
Point of reference

774
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:14,112
Right and that can't be a good or a bad thing

775
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,648
I am Alex walks

776
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,720
The presentation to be he's shifting people's perceptions

777
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:21,024
About 911 being an inside job

778
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,304
Right but in reality

779
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,840
If you

780
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:28,960
Explorer Eric Schmidt and you go to his website and you know take take it as material

781
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:29,984
Your perspective

782
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,008
Is going to

783
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,288
It'd be attempted to be shifted

784
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,336
To blaming Jews for everything

785
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,104
Yeah

786
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:37,408
Yeah you know it including

787
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:40,480
His own loneliness

788
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:46,112
What it reminds me of the way that you just described waking up is it in this context

789
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:49,952
Reminds me so much of the Sandman Comics at one point

790
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,232
He is ironic

791
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,792
Punishment is the guy is an eternal

792
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:54,816
He's eternally wake

793
00:37:55,072 --> 00:38:01,216
So he's always living that nightmare where you wake up from the dream and you're like I was just a dream and then it's a nightmare

794
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:01,984
Wake up from the dream

795
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,800
And that is kind of what they're experiencing their you're always

796
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:05,824
He's being woken up

797
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,592
Again

798
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:12,992
To this new thing now you're walking up to this new thing right to be terrified blank pills

799
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:15,296
That pill you are awake 2911

800
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:21,696
Now you need to be awake to this now you need to be a never-ending Nightmare and I think

801
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:24,000
Who easily exploitable by Folk

802
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:30,400
Looks like Alex and it is hooks in this world because you know the tendency to believe in conspiracy

803
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,168
Series

804
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,448
It really does

805
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,240
Build upon itself

806
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:38,848
Believing in one thing makes you more likely to believe in another and then another

807
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,200
Answer when it when it's like hahaha let me reveal another thing to you

808
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,224
Yeah that's

809
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,760
Be that's the market

810
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:49,856
And part of that feedback is the excitement you get from waking up again

811
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,648
I'm so excited

812
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:54,720
You know like all over again instead you're

813
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:58,048
You're just consigning yourself to doing it all again the next

814
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,864
Stay forever and ever until you die

815
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:07,264
I don't think I'm really that interested in his

816
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,592
Is even about 9/11

817
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:25,952
Right now

818
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:30,816
Lahore

819
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,144
What you doing

820
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,984
Actually I got into it

821
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,520
In a roundabout kind of way be

822
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,824
I just about software for a living

823
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,360
After the

824
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,152
Towers went down I was

825
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,712
Embarrassing on the internet there's a lot of

826
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,248
People that were called

827
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,528
Conspiracy nut

828
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,320
Talking about how all we should

829
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,344
Trust this

830
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,880
Government to borrow something

831
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,672
Funny about this attack

832
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,976
And I was like most people I wasn't

833
00:39:59,232 --> 00:39:59,744
Payment

834
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:00,768
Dismiss

835
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,352
But eventually they got through to me you know that

836
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,120
The constant

837
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,912
Complaining and I

838
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,448
Look up

839
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,216
Looking closely at

840
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:09,984
What happened

841
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:10,752
MattyB

842
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,056
That's when it occurred to me that those

843
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,080
Towers look like they were

844
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:14,848
Or blown up

845
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,176
Building 7 looks like it had explosives in it also

846
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,456
And I was thinking

847
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:21,760
First reaction

848
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,528
What is 2

849
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,064
Tell people about it.

850
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,112
Put some documents on the internet saying it looks like

851
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,904
Towers were blown up

852
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,440
Okay so

853
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:30,976
9/11 happen

854
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,024
And he's not that into

855
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,584
Not not paying that much attention

856
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,632
What you going to do okay

857
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,912
What about my life

858
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:39,680
Alright

859
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,960
That's New York

860
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:44,032
But when they started calling people weird

861
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:44,800
Rights

862
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:47,616
That's when I was like I got to go to the bottom of this

863
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,896
Everything exactly

864
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:51,456
No I mean a giant world-changing terrorists

865
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,224
Attack happen

866
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,760
Send look I got to do laundry

867
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:58,368
I got Ryan's going all right I'm not going to think about that and go oh well

868
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,672
The future of everything is a revocable changed

869
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:01,696
For the worse now

870
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,720
I could

871
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,000
I could pay attention to this

872
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:08,096
I got anti-semitic techno tonight

873
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,120
I can't figure out the

874
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,960
Yes I don't know I don't I don't think

875
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,752
I'm not impressed by his backs

876
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,312
No no no

877
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,616
Alex wants

878
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,152
Explain

879
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:21,920
What happened

880
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:22,688
A

881
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,088
What happened

882
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:32,928
Well it would it looks like it when you look

883
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:35,232
How these towers first of all when the planes

884
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,256
The towers

885
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,536
You cannot even

886
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,816
See in the video that the

887
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,376
Everyone has cameras all around it

888
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,656
And built ours didn't

889
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,680
Hardly move

890
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:46,496
They swallowed those planes up as if they were

891
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,032
Nothing I can

892
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,592
What shows house

893
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:53,407
Strong those Towers were to swallow a plane up at that

894
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,431
Highest speed

895
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:57,503
Without Really shaking or wobbling or crack

896
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,295
The plane

897
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,599
The plan is not damaged the building

898
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,391
All that much bases

899
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,183
Do the planes hit the

900
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:06,463
Hours

901
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:09,791
Shook a little bit

902
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,071
The power sway

903
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,095
But it was like

904
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:12,863
Strong winter

905
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:13,631
Storm

906
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:14,911
Adventure Tower

907
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:15,935
Extra backup

908
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,703
Again

909
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,495
And then settle down and then

910
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,031
Stood there perfectly motion

911
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:25,919
Is really dumb but it makes sense that this would be Eric's entry point into explaining how 9/11 was an inside job

912
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:30,015
Buildings like the Twin Towers are designed to sway because of the wind

913
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,551
Sky it otherwise

914
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,575
It'd be very dangerous

915
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:36,927
And you would never even notice that wobble even it goes like 6in

916
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:43,583
You wouldn't notice it if you were inside the building cuz you can subtly feel this way but you wouldn't notice it just watching a video

917
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:46,143
I used to work in Sears Tower

918
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,679
Willis

919
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,447
Stauer

920
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,751
Downtown and it sucks

921
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,799
It was really uncomfortable

922
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:53,567
Because I wasn't

923
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,591
Used to Amazon

924
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,127
So like it was

925
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:58,943
I was only there for a short. Time I never got to adjust

926
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,735
The feeling

927
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:03,039
Yeah it really freaked me out

928
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,319
But if you were

929
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:07,135
Just don't look at Willis Tower you never see it moving

930
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:13,535
Nobody's like all look at the way the Willis is shaking today

931
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,839
Can buckle is not enough for you to detect

932
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:22,495
It feels like you should be able to though so Eric's able to use this as like an introductory thing to throw out to blow so

933
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:23,263
Combined

934
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,311
Spider-Man really proving anything

935
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,639
Classic conspiracy drivel

936
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,175
Yeah

937
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:31,711
The Gulf

938
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:33,503
Between what seems like

939
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,295
Could be and should be true

940
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,575
And what is

941
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,111
Is so large

942
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,415
That there's so many places where it's like

943
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:44,255
You can't understand how everything works

944
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:45,535
You just can't

945
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:48,351
I can understand how giant buildings were

946
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,375
I can do my best

947
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:54,751
Play zingaat from not good at

948
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,543
Bora Bora

949
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:01,407
Schmidt is an incredibly boring gas

950
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:04,735
You know Alex just have an interview that dances around the general most

951
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:05,503
Common talking

952
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,527
Pointer at 9:11

953
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,063
Conspiracy theories and

954
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:08,831
Sucks

955
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,879
Naturally they don't get into any of

956
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,647
Eric's almost

957
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,183
Comical hatred of Jewish

958
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:18,047
People because Alex isn't trying to give the audience an accurate picture of the people he's presenting as expert

959
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,071
That they should serve

960
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,399
Don't make it too clear to them they're involved

961
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,703
Eric Schmidt sucks

962
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:28,799
And I've gone through a lot of his website to get a better sense of what he's all about

963
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,591
Everything is about the Jews

964
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,895
There's a lot of Holocaust Denial in the mix

965
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:36,991
There's one article that I thought might be interesting

966
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,015
As a break

967
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:41,599
From the rampant anti-Semitism right cuz it was

968
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,623
Interpretation

969
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,927
Of Katy Perry's video

970
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:51,327
California Gurls Katy Perry baited a Semitic video

971
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:55,423
Girls are undeniable Daisy Dukes

972
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,983
Amazon top

973
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,519
Pez have to say about

974
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,823
Katy Perry videos

975
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,127
Clumsy take on Candy Land that's

976
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,151
Intentionally

977
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:05,919
Campi in it

978
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,711
It's overt sexuality

979
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:08,991
It's a little bit much

980
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:12,319
Naturally Eric believes that it's an allegory for house

981
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:14,623
The Jews control pop stars as sex slaves

982
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:19,999
It's very boring and it only includes a surface layer analysis of my favorite lyric

983
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:20,767
Snoop Dogg's in

984
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:21,535
Entire career

985
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:25,119
Bikinis zucchinis martinis no weenies

986
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,399
The king and his Queen

987
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,447
Great life

988
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,471
That's just

989
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:34,079
Bikinis zucchinis

990
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:36,127
Louis I will tell you this

991
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:39,455
That would not go unappreciated by Lord Byron

992
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:41,759
He would he would very much of enjoyed that

993
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:44,831
I also love to imagine this party

994
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,111
Acrylic

995
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:49,439
Lord Byron would have been in one of those bars

996
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:52,255
Zucchini

997
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,791
Yeah like it's weed

998
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,583
So you got blunts

999
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,863
Keeney's

1000
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,447
And the drink of choice is a martini

1001
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:02,751
Party drinks

1002
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:03,519
Negroni

1003
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:10,175
I would like you would like a my time with the rhyme scheme no course not but a martini on the beach sounds

1004
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,199
Terrible that does.

1005
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:15,807
Straight gin and vermouth

1006
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,599
Has not good but no weed

1007
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:20,415
That's fine no losers

1008
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,207
So apparently this is

1009
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,231
Scription of an orgy

1010
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:23,999
According to Eric

1011
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:24,767
Which is better

1012
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:31,679
There's an entire Saga about this woman who apparently has been emailing Eric and wanting to marry him

1013
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:35,263
But he breaks off contact with her out of fear that you might be asleep

1014
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,031
Jewish aging

1015
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:42,431
Center possibly mentally ill is afraid that she might be mentally ill

1016
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,735
He suspects and speculate

1017
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,015
It's about how this could be a setup

1018
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:51,903
One of the thoughts that passed through my mind is that Peggy could be used in a manner similar to Mark Chapa

1019
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:56,767
Specifically the Jews may be pushing for her to meet with me and then the Jews will be able to

1020
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,047
Kill both of us and make it

1021
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:01,119
Appear as a murder and suicide by a mentally ill woman

1022
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:04,703
So this is like I said

1023
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:07,263
He tries to reassure himself

1024
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,287
But you just can't quite

1025
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:11,871
Peggy sent me her photo and she doesn't look

1026
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:14,687
Jewish to me but I don't think it's possible to Identity

1027
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:17,503
Identify every two simply by the way they look

1028
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:18,783
Only some of them fit

1029
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:19,551
The stereotype

1030
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:24,671
Men are suckers for pretty women but if he emailed you is just as dangerous as a female shark

1031
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:25,951
They're not our friend

1032
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:27,487
Don't be fooled by their appearance

1033
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:31,327
Control your stupid animal like emotions and look at the evidence

1034
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,375
Through history and notice how the Jews have been

1035
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,911
Treating us for thousands of years

1036
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:37,215
They have never been anybody's friend

1037
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:41,311
Oh so this is the guy they based 7 on

1038
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:48,735
Disgusting stuff that is got to be the journals that has to be the Diaries of a f****** serial killer

1039
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:52,831
It's really really f***** up f****** things

1040
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,111
Likes hunting

1041
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:56,671
High and low for an article about something

1042
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,719
Didn't Trace back to a Jewish can

1043
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,487
Conspiracy theory

1044
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,279
There's a lot of stuff on this site

1045
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,559
All of it

1046
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:03,327
Is just

1047
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:05,887
Somehow woven back to a complaint about

1048
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:07,423
I like even though

1049
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,703
This whole thing about this woman

1050
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:15,359
Yeah it goes back again Isaiah 27 tell even even ramping a anti-semites at this point have to be like hey

1051
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:21,759
Hey dude we think you just have a problem causing your problems like maybe we

1052
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,807
We think that it's the Jews fault for everything

1053
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:25,087
But not for you buddy

1054
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,367
Size able to find one

1055
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,159
1

1056
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:30,975
And I will not read you some Pastor jobs

1057
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:34,303
I refrain from giving good reviews to product

1058
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,583
Because I've only used

1059
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,631
Few of the thousands of products on the market

1060
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,679
Is this where you got the back shaver

1061
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:46,079
But I recently tried some underwear that is so much more comfortable than everything I've had in my life

1062
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:50,431
But I thought I would mention it in case some of you have been irritated by your underwear also

1063
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:53,759
Put in code anti-semite at biondes.

1064
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:57,855
It is a pouch style made by David Archy

1065
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:03,999
This underwear is extremely comfortable for standing sitting or walking

1066
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:07,327
But if you have to do a lot of movements of your pelvic area such as

1067
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,119
Is crawling around in a decorfix

1068
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:11,423
Plumbing problems or doing exercise

1069
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,727
Extreme movements can cause your penis

1070
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:15,007
To be pulled out of the pouch

1071
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,823
But it remains comfortable even when that happened

1072
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,431
How do you feel

1073
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:25,503
Citibank in Manteca

1074
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:31,647
Put back in don't put that in a review put it back in before you put it in a review

1075
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,415
Okay

1076
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:34,719
Update February 1st 2020

1077
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:36,255
That there's an update

1078
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:39,583
Shorter version bikini version

1079
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:41,119
I do not

1080
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,911
Like the bikini version

1081
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:49,311
Because after moving around a bit the material moves a slight bit off my scrotum allowing it to touch the skin of my leg

1082
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,359
I am just

1083
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:52,895
I

1084
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,431
Just ghetto

1085
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:57,247
People are more than just one

1086
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:01,343
Bounds on this underwear for what

1087
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,391
Seems like the length of a novella

1088
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,927
It does seem to be going to want

1089
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:07,999
Unfortunately modern societies have such a problem with sex

1090
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:13,887
Scribes and sexual inhibition that these and underwear review the underwear of a word such as

1091
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:14,655
Testicles

1092
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:17,471
Send penis

1093
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:20,031
The boys

1094
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:22,079
What makes this underwear so nice

1095
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:22,847
Is Betty

1096
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,407
What I wondered what

1097
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,431
Possible in a.

1098
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,711
Document that I posted almost

1099
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:30,015
Years ago of which is to provide

1100
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:32,063
A pouch or are testicles

1101
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:36,159
This underwear goes even further provides a pouch for our penis

1102
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,183
Oh that's

1103
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:40,255
Spats

1104
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:45,375
8 years ago there's a hyperlink speculate about this eight years prior

1105
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:46,655
Merry Maids

1106
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,423
Wow

1107
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:52,799
There are not a bunch of product reviews on this site and as far as I can tell this is the only one

1108
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:59,455
He found some great underwear so he's got to talk about it at length on his ridiculously anti-semitic conspiracy theory site

1109
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:02,783
What group did a free advertising for David Archy

1110
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,575
Underwear they've got to be thrilled

1111
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,183
You seem confused

1112
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:13,535
What am I supposed to do with the existence of all of that

1113
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,327
Simultaneous

1114
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,119
How do you think of Siri

1115
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:23,263
I don't know where this website now it's full of hate and then there's a f****** underwear reviewer he complains about the

1116
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,799
Anyone

1117
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:33,247
If he doesn't like the bikini-style he can't come to Snoop Dogg

1118
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,015
Noah

1119
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:37,087
Which means that those underwear wear your weenie pops out

1120
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,367
Give me

1121
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:41,439
But I think it's a metaphorical weenie in

1122
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,463
Snoop song

1123
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:45,023
I think he's a literal weidian this song

1124
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,583
I wish he had a breakdown of all of

1125
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,399
Katy Perry's videos

1126
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:57,311
Last Friday Night the problem with this is that you can't be a rampant vicious anti-semite and then do a one-off

1127
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,591
Product review

1128
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:01,663
You know that's got to be like a new weekly segment

1129
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:06,015
Product

1130
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:07,551
Bicycle

1131
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:11,391
It doesn't have it doesn't switch gears snow gear change

1132
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:14,463
Solid ride

1133
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:20,863
Stuck to my scrotum

1134
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,655
Where is Vitas

1135
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:23,935
URS Coronavirus

1136
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:28,543
So it goes on and on about his various thoughts about this underwear

1137
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:33,919
For reasons that escape me with this section which I will read to you in full

1138
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:37,247
Since this document is probably going

1139
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,015
To be considered a

1140
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:43,647
Obscene by some people I may as well mention another issue that adults oughta be discussing without Hysteria

1141
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:46,975
My God specifically some men believe in having a large

1142
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:51,071
Floppy penis makes them better than the bed

1143
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:56,703
You are not telling

1144
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:00,287
This eventually goes on a small penis rat

1145
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:07,711
Oh my God man believe it having a large floppy penis makes them better than the men have smaller penises or who have

1146
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:14,367
Accordion type penis that compressors do a smaller-sized Growers and showers

1147
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:21,791
Some people have been so convinced of is that they're stretching their penis to make it bigger such as Roberto Cabrera

1148
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:23,583
Businesses are offering products

1149
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,351
Penis stretcher

1150
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,167
And one of the questions on the Amazon site

1151
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:31,519
It sells the David Archy underwear is from man who's hoping that the underwear will make it

1152
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,543
Penis look larger

1153
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:34,847
The children who grow up in the USA

1154
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:37,919
Could pick up the attitude that men should have giant penises

1155
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,711
Hemet women should have dying breath

1156
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:43,807
How many people actually wants such features and their spouse

1157
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:46,879
Furthermore are those people quote normal

1158
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,927
Or are they mentally ill

1159
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:49,951
To quote

1160
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:54,559
Normal women actually care whether a man has a large floppy penis

1161
00:53:55,071 --> 00:54:00,959
You know as a writer I will tell you this whenever you have certain little phrases

1162
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:06,335
Can kind of gear us towards what your point of view or perspective that you're bringing in in

1163
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:08,383
If you have repeated large floppy penis

1164
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:12,223
That is something that you view is a negative my friend

1165
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:15,807
Normal women actually care whether a man is a large floppy penis

1166
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:20,671
I realize that women walked erect penis has to be a certain size and shape

1167
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:24,767
But how many women care how long a penis is when it's limp

1168
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:28,863
Just fact how many women even want to look at a man's limp

1169
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:31,167
Who is this you Chris Rock

1170
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:36,031
My opinion is that giant floppy penises are annoyed

1171
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:52,415
My penis will compressed like an accordion when it's cold and I think that it is much more comfortable compared to

1172
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:54,207
To wet it is warm and flopping around

1173
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:57,791
Although this David Archy underwear is making that flopping problem just

1174
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:58,559
Superior

1175
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:01,375
Underwear review

1176
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:08,031
Oh God oh my God right so I mean there's a cereality to this today

1177
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:10,591
I feel like sometimes I want to

1178
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:11,359
Be able

1179
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:14,175
To allow people who are listening to our show.

1180
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,199
Get a gun

1181
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:21,343
Listening to Alex's show he introduces a guest you look into them a little bit you find this

1182
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:25,183
Bordering on extermination ism

1183
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,463
Type approach

1184
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,487
Jewish people

1185
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:29,535
Some of it mask

1186
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:31,071
In a

1187
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:34,911
Pretend opposition to Zionism some of it just mask

1188
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:35,679
CNA

1189
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:39,519
Ooki intific bulshit

1190
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:41,311
You know that is

1191
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:44,639
Unacceptable on on a hundred different

1192
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:45,663
Levels

1193
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:47,711
Then you poke around a little bit more in the

1194
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,735
Can you find this

1195
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:53,599
Ridiculous s*** like the Katy Perry video review being contextualized as

1196
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:57,183
Jewish people having Popstar sex slaves whatever

1197
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,999
This nonsense

1198
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:01,791
And you're like this is

1199
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,583
I just don't know what to do

1200
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:04,863
Yeah

1201
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:05,631
Yeah

1202
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:06,911
How do I not share this

1203
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:07,679
This is what I'm saying

1204
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:11,007
Yeah it is man

1205
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,287
Cuz it cuz

1206
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:14,079
Hate

1207
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,615
Is what this guy is

1208
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,383
Built this life

1209
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:19,967
His entire life is geared around hate

1210
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:22,527
. and ended his his

1211
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:23,551
Focus of it

1212
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:25,855
AZ is on Jewish people

1213
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:27,391
For whatever reason

1214
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:30,463
You know it's not obviously for anything that makes any sense

1215
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:33,535
Then you would have to have an argument that it makes

1216
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:35,583
Well I think

1217
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:40,447
The way you can kind of make a little bit of sense of ease that so many historical can

1218
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:46,847
Conspiracy theories have lead downhill towards antisemitism into a hateful

1219
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:52,479
Conspiratorial mindview and you start exploring a ton of things odds are you will encounter material that

1220
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:54,015
It takes you down that road

1221
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:57,855
So I think it's more likely to lead to that vent to lead to other

1222
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:02,463
Conclusion on the way I can make sense of it but in terms of the ideas make

1223
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,023
Obviously

1224
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,047
But

1225
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:07,327
But it is

1226
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:08,863
It is

1227
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,143
AAA

1228
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:13,471
Picture not of somebody with like some sort of

1229
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:15,263
Mastermind dije

1230
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,799
Dates that is is

1231
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:20,639
Built around like trying to achieve something or or

1232
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:23,455
Exploit something or anything along those lines

1233
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:26,783
And it really does feel like this is a person who is

1234
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:29,855
Isolated in I mean just

1235
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:30,879
Insane

1236
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:33,695
Indeed

1237
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,999
In need of so many things

1238
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:40,351
And it's also like f***** up

1239
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:44,703
I think that a number of hints you could get from his website are

1240
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:45,983
Definitely

1241
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:48,031
Showing some needs not being met

1242
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:51,871
Yeah for sure and no way does that excuse

1243
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:53,407
The direction that it goes to

1244
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:57,759
It also this big floppy penis

1245
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:58,783
Underwear review

1246
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:02,111
It highlights another thing that I think is is crucial

1247
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:04,927
You start to see

1248
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:08,511
And that is like with Alex he's a f****** monster who puts out

1249
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10,303
The hateful bigoted material

1250
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,583
Often times

1251
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,887
Crypto and nature sometimes

1252
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:16,191
Hiding behind other rational

1253
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:17,215
Those four things

1254
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:18,495
But he also

1255
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:23,871
Sings along with The Highwayman and he also talks Over You Belong To The City

1256
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:24,895
See also

1257
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:27,455
Like sci-fi to an unhealthy

1258
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:30,271
The extant like there's other facets of his personality

1259
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:34,879
Michael Savage came up earlier and I used to listen to a ton of Michael Savage's show

1260
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,671
And he is a horse

1261
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:37,951
Bigoted as well

1262
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:38,719
But

1263
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:40,767
Sometimes he tells a story

1264
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:45,119
And he can leave an amazing yarn about old-time San Francisco Eatery

1265
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:46,911
Like that like

1266
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:50,239
There are other facets of these people's personalities they

1267
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,263
But sometimes our

1268
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:52,287
Are like

1269
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,567
This is bizarre

1270
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:56,383
People aren't only a bigger

1271
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:59,199
And that is also part of what makes

1272
00:58:59,455 --> 00:58:59,967
Them

1273
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:00,991
It makes

1274
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,271
Some people

1275
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,295
Distracted from their big

1276
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:04,319
Bigotry

1277
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:06,879
I think I think I'm

1278
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:16,095
Not trying to excuse his head or provide an explanation

1279
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:18,399
Course

1280
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,167
I I take

1281
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:20,191
I think it's like

1282
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:21,983
With this

1283
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:26,079
Particular situation there are Lanes of of big

1284
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:27,359
Country that you can kind of

1285
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:31,455
Push people down or classify people under you know you have people like

1286
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,223
Tucker

1287
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:33,759
Who is a virulent

1288
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:37,855
Bigot who is smart enough to hide just enough of it to pass

1289
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:40,671
Who is using it for evil as reading of gas

1290
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:43,231
Friend editing

1291
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:46,559
And he's doing all of this in service of

1292
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:47,327
Money and

1293
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,607
Power and all of this s***

1294
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:50,911
And this guy is not that

1295
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,447
You know

1296
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:53,983
No he's a bigot

1297
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:56,543
Something

1298
00:59:57,055 --> 01:00:00,895
Indifferent he's somebody who has a

1299
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:03,455
Far more of a willingness then

1300
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,735
Tucker or Ally

1301
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:06,015
Likes to just be up

1302
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:06,783
Front about the

1303
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:07,807
8:30

1304
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:11,391
Yeah and then simultaneously he's somebody who's like

1305
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:12,927
A little bit

1306
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:13,695
Too old

1307
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:14,463
2

1308
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,999
Experience blogging

1309
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:17,279
You know what

1310
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:19,071
That's the kind of sense that you get

1311
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:20,863
A number of these articles

1312
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,399
He's like somebody who

1313
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:24,703
Discover is that blogs

1314
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,983
Exist and think

1315
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:28,031
That everybody needs to hear all their thoughts

1316
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:28,799
About underwear

1317
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:32,383
Or like this is going to be somehow a meeting full

1318
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,199
Is a pouch

1319
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:35,967
Underwear like

1320
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:38,783
Like is that revolutionary at whatever point he's

1321
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:42,623
Think so I don't know

1322
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:48,767
I've never put as much thought into underwear as he put into I guess

1323
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:51,071
The words big floppy penis

1324
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:53,119
I have not put that much thought into underwear

1325
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,935
Yeah the compound noun for for this fellow

1326
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:59,263
So here's one last clip with Alex and

1327
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:01,823
This is this is another thing that I think is important

1328
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,359
22

1329
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:08,223
2 hour

1330
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:09,247
Video

1331
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,527
Also

1332
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:12,063
Full of I don't know

1333
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:13,087
Over 100

1334
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,975
Incredible

1335
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:28,191
Powerful

1336
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:29,983
The family up

1337
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:33,567
Alex is taking his access to his audience

1338
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:34,847
And using it

1339
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:35,615
2

1340
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:37,151
Funnel monetary support

1341
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:42,015
To Eric and simultaneously he's selling his material so Alex is making

1342
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:43,039
Big money

1343
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:45,599
Getting the audience to support

1344
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:47,135
And by Eric's

1345
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:47,903
Materials

1346
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:50,975
Now when we talk about Sandy Hook

1347
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:51,743
Stuff

1348
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:52,511
One of the

1349
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:53,279
Things that is

1350
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,303
Is really important

1351
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,327
To consider

1352
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:56,607
In terms of

1353
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:57,631
A lot of people

1354
01:01:57,887 --> 01:02:01,215
Always wrong about something and then he apologized why is it so bad

1355
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:03,263
But when you really look back

1356
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,031
At this

1357
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:04,799
.

1358
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:09,919
And you look at the way that Alex was funneling his audience to support Wolfgang halbig

1359
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:14,271
Facilitate his ability to carry out the harassment

1360
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:16,831
To fight the legal battles

1361
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:19,135
That he was in the way Alex

1362
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,159
Directed

1363
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:20,927
And

1364
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:23,743
Advocated for his audience to give that money

1365
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:26,303
Yeah and the way that Alex

1366
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,071
Sold

1367
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:29,375
Their stuff on his website

1368
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:31,423
That is irrelevant piece of

1369
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:33,983
The machine that Alex has built

1370
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,775
And the audience

1371
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:37,055
Trust

1372
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:37,823
And

1373
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:39,615
Access that he has

1374
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:40,895
He has

1375
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,943
Like given

1376
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:45,759
Extreme people

1377
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,295
Access to money

1378
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:49,087
That they would not have otherwise

1379
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:50,879
Wolfgang halbig didn't have access

1380
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:52,159
Let's do a giant platform

1381
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,183
Before Alex

1382
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,463
Allowed that

1383
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:58,303
Erica Schmidt was on public access interviews and s***

1384
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,583
Like you didn't

1385
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,631
Even Allison 2003 was probably a big

1386
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:02,399
Big big forehead

1387
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:05,983
This is

1388
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:07,519
Of what Alex

1389
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:08,799
Is and does

1390
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:10,591
Without him

1391
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,895
I mean nowadays

1392
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:14,175
It's probably diminish

1393
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:15,711
Somewhat cuz there's so many

1394
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:16,479
Internet

1395
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:19,039
Platforms that have large audiences have

1396
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:22,111
I put a. Of time like this

1397
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:24,415
Sand into the early 2010s

1398
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:27,231
Like Alex was something that

1399
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:29,279
Was able to be

1400
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:31,071
A monetary

1401
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,607
Victory

1402
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,143
For these extremist

1403
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:36,191
Able to be on Alex's show

1404
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:37,471
LED tube

1405
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:38,751
Reno

1406
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:41,567
Probably access to a lot of stuff you wouldn't have access to otherwise.

1407
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:44,895
And the way that it was spread

1408
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:47,711
When there weren't those

1409
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:50,271
Those million different outlets in million different internet

1410
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,551
That's faces for a tutu

1411
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:53,087
To grow the way that Alex said

1412
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:55,903
Built Avenue can see all the guys

1413
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:57,439
That we still see around now

1414
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:59,743
You know like if it works for

1415
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:01,279
The way that that was

1416
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:03,071
Disseminated

1417
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,863
A lot of guys wouldn't have quite

1418
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:07,679
Like the same I have staying power though

1419
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:12,287
Well that's fair I don't think Webster Tarpley is that big of a acre

1420
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:16,639
Bright 20 still just hosting the fourth hour of that way

1421
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:19,455
Didn't work out for everybody

1422
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:22,783
Anyway we come to the end of this episode and like I said

1423
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,575
Little bit shorter but you know what

1424
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:25,599
Sometimes

1425
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:26,367
The end up

1426
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:28,671
Reading a lot of an assholes blog

1427
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:30,975
I do think that it's

1428
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:32,767
Really important to recognize this stuff

1429
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,327
He's such a

1430
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:37,375
Great illustration of

1431
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,655
This

1432
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:42,239
Sort of the Counterpoint to the argument that Alex's show tunes

1433
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:46,079
That's of no it was baked in

1434
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:47,359
It was there

1435
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:49,919
The perception of it might not have been

1436
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:51,711
As easily accessible

1437
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:52,991
Buy a passive viewer

1438
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:54,783
But it was there

1439
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:58,111
I do I don't mind that this is shorter I feel like

1440
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:00,927
With this guy has given me a lot to sit with

1441
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:07,839
I'm going to be driving later just going like

1442
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:10,911
F*** yeah f*** that f***

1443
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:11,679
Cooking guy

1444
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:15,775
What's a Big Papi

1445
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:22,175
This is the sort of unsung emotional labor podcast

1446
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:26,271
This struggling after the fact

1447
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,039
To survive

1448
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:31,135
It is it is like oh okay

1449
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,415
Alright I'll touch that hot

1450
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,951
All right but

1451
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:37,535
How recording on Tuesday I learned a little bit
