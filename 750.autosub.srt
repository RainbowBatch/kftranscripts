00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Soletic

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392

00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,832
Collegeboard.com

Alex Jones

5
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,656
Quick question for you

6
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:14,496
What's up my bright spot today is

7
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,800
You know I know they were going into the thanks

8
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:23,200
Giving week lot of feelings about Thanksgiving

9
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,992
Of course but it's

10
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:25,760
It is

11
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,040
At best

12
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:32,160
Take away a lot of a trappings at the time to think about things that you're thankful for

13
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:37,280
Jordan Breanna audience and

14
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:43,680
Having a moment to think about these things and how how great and how many things we have to be thankful

15
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,472
For Eyes is very

16
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:49,568
Humbling and nice experience that I've had the last couple days

17
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:55,968
Yeah yeah you know I actually almost prefer when I had fewer things to be grateful for

18
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:02,368
Be grateful for it freaks me out

19
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,904
Weigh less than any of them

20
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,536
Give me 1/3 of 60

21
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:15,936
Yeah it's it's overwhelming but positive way and thank you all very

Very grateful

23
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:26,176
The jewelry that awarded 1.5 billion dollars baby

24
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:32,576
Another thing to be grateful for, thankful do played whatever small role in that as I did

25
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,344
We did

26
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:40,000

00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:21,599
He probably isn't but we don't know the Jordan

105
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:27,999
Have Alex in the present-day on timeout because I feel like if it's Thanksgiving is one thing we should be thankful for

106
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,535
Matt is being able to

107
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,559

You know Linda mentioned certainly think

00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,807
Can thinking about my family

113
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,599
What what better way

114
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,695
To celebrate Thanksgiving on

115
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:03,839
Then to enjoy the deposition of Alex's dad

116
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:08,703
So today we're going to be talking about

117
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:13,311
Did the Connecticut case

118
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,455
To trick you

119
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:25,855
Right right you know a lot of my normal mood I wasn't expecting the David Jones death

120
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:30,207
Position you had me on that one you've got me clean clean there yet

121
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:36,607
I'd like to know that I still got still got a few options and eyebrow fake a great part of our relationship

122
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:43,007
For still learning got to keep it fresh

123
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,543
AJ's dad

124
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:51,199
As we know Alex's Dad is he is a dentist by trade

125
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:57,599
He is somebody who is B6 smartest boy in Texas

126
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,879
Is variable

127
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:02,463
One of the smartest Boys in Texas and and so the globalist

128
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,023
Straight to recruit him into a program of eugenics

129
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,887
Orloff the population that he said no thank you notes and they just really like alright cool

130
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:16,287
No big deal why don't you tell your blowhard son about this in a few years because

131
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:22,687
View to you via I suppose very obvious means that we have a secret program before you would

132
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:29,087
Beyblade all at 4

133
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,623
World we're going to leave you alone

134
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:35,231
The guy who knows our plans that could possibly afford them by telling your blowhard son

135
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:39,327
The radio show with millions of listeners

136
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,423
He is the subject of fables

137
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,239
Yes on Infowars horseshoer

138
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:50,079
And at least definitely

139
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:56,479
Current Berkshire but we'll see any more pics and ideas

140
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,503
That didn't that didn't

141
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:02,367
End up stopping Society lecturer younger years

142
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,999
Yeah. There's a lot of that I know about him and

143
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,791
Facts

144
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,583
I know real facts

145
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:18,239
Whatever I know Alex fact about him but I don't know that much about him in general

146
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:22,335
I not really even seen pictures of him before the deposition

147
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,639
Not really heard his voice

148
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,783
I've never heard on Infowars Alex said he refuses to

149
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,063
Smart

150
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:37,439
And at least a fairly smart boy in Texas still

151
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,231
Snow in 2019

152
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,303
He sat for a deposition with Chris Maddie

153
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,351
And Norm is there

154
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:47,679
My friend Norm Pata source is representing him

155
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:52,031
And I think this is a shorter deposition as a whole

156
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,103
It's probably about an hour long all day

157
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,127
And

158
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,151
I think

159
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:03,295
That it still has some pretty interesting things being said Alex's dad

160
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,343
And maybe some things that

161
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,879
Help

162
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,415
Didn't help with Cato yeah

163
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,719
Brighton

164
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,255
With David

165
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,583
Can I ask you a quick question on Cone

166
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:21,727
Before we before we get before we get going and their actual tone is revealed I would like to know

167
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,519
Is this

168
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,567
Predicting he's going to be somewhat

169
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,335
Combative

170
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,663
Just kind of like a kind of like an aloof a******

171
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,223
Maybe a little aloof

172
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,783
I wouldn't say he's like super combative

173
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,551
He's not

174
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:43,743
Forthcoming okay alright alright

175
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,791
Bring up the the sort of tone

176
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:49,375
There is a something I'd like to point out

177
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,679
And you can take note of as we go along

178
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,215
America's debt

179
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
He

180
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:58,079
He's very like much smarter than Alex

181
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:04,479
Very good at not answering questions while answering them in a way that kind of has the

182
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:10,879
Appearance of an this going to be the first time that we are looking at somebody who is about to get trapped

183
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:11,903
Going

184
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,951
Oh well I know this is a trap

185
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:20,351
Maybe even a step before that

186
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,887
Dangerous

187
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:27,263
Starkiller with a discussion of his his coming to Infowars

188
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,799
When did you

189
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,335
I'll retire

190
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,615
From your career is a dent

191
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,199
I still

192
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,479
Have a life

193
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,039
But I retired from Act

194
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,807
Back to practice

195
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:40,831
2000 +

196
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,183
And is that when you became

197
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:45,951
Involved

198
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,231
In the operations

199
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
Capri's Pizza

200
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,423
That is when I became more

201
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,191
Formally

202
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
Involved

203
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,751
So we got it we got a text I'm here

204
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,519
My friend

205
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,455
Yeah he's got that he's got much more of a voice that you kind of expect for someone

206
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,503
That sort of Jones character

207
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,367
He's somebody who is not spent the first twenty years of his career doing a Rush Limbaugh

208
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:19,231
Impression right to destroy any chance at all of that accent any longer

209
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:25,631
I would say that if Alex sounded like this a little bit more of a I don't know if you could do

210
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:32,031
Who is delivery no this is yeah

211
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:36,639
Text boy draw

212
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,687
He's taking his time

213
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:44,063
So before he left his

214
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,903
Practice his Dentistry

215
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:53,791
In 2013 even before that he was part of the business as if it was a family business

216
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,095
This is something kind of weird here

217
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,631
What was your role before then

218
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,215
Justice being involved in

219
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,031
An advisory role essay

220
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,567
In a family business

221
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,895
So Alex would sometimes ask you for advice

222
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,663
About that

223
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,711
Occasion

224
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,527
Did your involvement

225
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,551
Anything other than

226
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,319
A Barbie house

227
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,087
Device

228
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,367
No

229
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,415
I'm in an

230
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,695
And

231
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,279
And what types of

232
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,583
Matters would he ask for your advice

233
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,711
Largely what am I

234
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,503
Perceptions were about things

235
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,295
We're going on in the world

236
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,367
Moral compass

237
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,487
So for example

238
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,023
Alex might be

239
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,047
Be considering covering

240
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,583
Turn story in the news

241
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,351
And would

242
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
Discuss that with you

243
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,239
Not so much it's like did you hear such a

244
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,007
Concession water

245
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:09,823
Best of

246
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,895
Now that's that's basic

247
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
Sickly what he would

248
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:17,247
Say to me and I was largely he wanted to know what I thought of

249
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,783
His expressions

250
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,319
And things but I don't know how much

251
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:27,743
Papaya papaya what do you think of fentanyl the Chinese dragon it's an interesting thing

252
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,767
David

253
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,839
To say that he is the moral compass

254
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:38,495
Yeah particularly because going to be starting in 2013 to be more involved with the business and this is around

255
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,543
Around the time that San Diego coverages

256
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:44,383
Is going on if indeed he is a moral compass then

257
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,431
You would hope that they would be

258
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,735
Plenty of evidence of him being like Alex

259
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:53,855
Stop this Alex may be listening or maybe not it's entirely possible that you could

260
00:15:54,111 --> 00:16:00,255
Imagine a scenario where even though he is Alex's dad

261
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,791
But

262
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:05,119
I think I think presenting yourself in that way

263
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:11,519
Raise the expectation of like what did you do as the moral compass mean if if if if you were to describe

264
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,287
Tumi

265
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,335
If you are now if you were to say Jordan

266
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,359
Describe

267
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,175
What's the moral compass for Infowars looks like

268
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,479
I would say it is

269
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,247
Cracked

270
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,295
The glass is completely removed

271
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:27,647
The White and the red lines are exactly the same there just one color

272
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,719
It's spinning in all directions simultaneously

273
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,279
And somehow constantly being thrown out the window

274
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,071
Hindi

275
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:41,471
Ongoing active being thrown out the window thing is it's not if it wouldn't be used

276
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:45,823
I wouldn't lay claim to being one I wouldn't be like haha I know what my role is

277
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,895
Maybe doesn't have True North it doesn't

278
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,455
It doesn't seem to be functioning

279
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,271
He he gay

280
00:16:54,527 --> 00:17:00,671
You can kind of see a little bit in there the way that there is a dancing around questions

281
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,695
I instantly

282
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:05,279
This is a man who understands the consequence of things

283
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:11,679
Like I don't know what he thinks the consequences are or any of that stuff but they are there

284
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,215
He's a person who knows.

285
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:19,615
A known almost scientific would like if I remove this tooth There Will Be Blood like an that kind of sense so if I save

286
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:25,759
Cause and effect

287
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:31,903
He's saying that he kind of like gave advice and like all this stuff and it's like okay

288
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:38,303
So you're saying that he would ask you about what stories to cover attic

289
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,911
Split pull that back

290
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,983
In 2013 he became more involved with the business

291
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,775
And at this point

292
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:54,687
He entered into what I would describe as a very bizarre Financial arrangement with Infowars

293
00:17:55,711 --> 00:18:01,855
Right this doesn't last very long as they have for a year or so

294
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,159
For another Arrangement cakes input this is

295
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,183
This is why

296
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,255
In 2013 did you

297
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,215
I became indirectly an employee of

298
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,055
Okay

299
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,335
Why we didn't

300
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,407
I had a professional Corporation

301
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,175
Contracted

302
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,199
With large dental practice

303
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,223
This Management Group

304
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:31,807
And that Corporation lost its income when it lost

305
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:32,831
It's an employee

306
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,623
And so that Aunt

307
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,415
2K my professional Corporation

308
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,463
Spade lost opportunity fees

309
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,255
And it paid me

310
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,559
To be an employee of Alec

311
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,327
Townsend

312
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,631
Free Speech systems

313
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,399
Play paid

314
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,423
Your

315
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,983
The corporation that you can fold

316
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,519
Four lost lost off

317
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,287
Opportunities

318
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,311
As a result of

319
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,103
Retiring from your dental practice

320
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,407
And that Corporation

321
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,175
You can fold

322
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,455
Then paid you

323
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,991
A salary

324
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,807
In connection with your work for free speech system

325
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,623
Why was it arranged

326
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,975
Purpose of winding down in continuity

327
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,559
It was probably not impart

328
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,583
But it was a real

329
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:22,751
What employer

330
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,287
Yes

331
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,055
When was that

332
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:25,823
I believe that

333
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,591
What's the next year

334
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615
2004

335
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,407
That's

336
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,175
Weird

337
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:36,575
But I don't know if it's necessarily suspicious or anyting

338
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,879
It's not packed evasion but it's like

339
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:44,511
Hey if you do it this way there's 20% extra for something or other along the way.

340
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:50,911
Possible write-offs or something even less so to sneakily there could be situations

341
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:55,263
Visionware like he was the primary Center of that dental practice

342
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,895
And maybe transferring over to somebody else being bored like the center of the dental practice

343
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,175
Would take time

344
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:06,015
And so in order not to torpedo that other persons

345
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:10,111
Ability to practice maybe that's why but it is weird

346
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,135
And it's just

347
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:17,535
It just 1 and 100 examples of really bizarre Financial things surrounding Infowars

348
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:21,119
Unusual insofar as it's a

349
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:26,751
Clear evidence of somebody who knows the financial system is doing something to their

350
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:33,151
You know it seems like if it was like a practical issue about the dental practice itself maybe there be

351
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,967
Way to get up a buyout or something

352
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:41,343
I don't know anything but it just thought it was like

353
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:44,159
It's weird I don't think this one is nefarious

354
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,999
But I do think this is an evidentiary

355
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,791
That suggests there are

356
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:54,399
People at work with financial information that they are capable of

357
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,959
Bleeding in certain ways good

358
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:02,847
The line between legal and illegal maybe just a matter of who enforces what

359
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,895
You know England

360
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,687
Ghetto this is Alex's dad

361
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:13,343
So there is also the consideration of like having your dad come work for you was important

362
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,367
Enough that you

363
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,928
Didn't this Byzantine arrangement

364
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,720
Why is that what's

365
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,512
Like what purpose of this

366
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,560
I don't know it it's

367
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:28,960
It may not be shady as an arrangement about the surrounding circumstances of it make it feel quite

368
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,776
The moment Alex Jones is involved in shady as s***

369
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,312
That's fair enough

370
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:38,688
So David Jones as we know was the Human Resources Director

371
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,736
During that first year

372
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,760
Or thereabouts

373
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:42,784
2013

374
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,088
Do you have

375
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,112
Title

376
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,416
Free speech

377
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,720
I was sort of a

378
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,512
The consultant in an HR Direct

379
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,144
But not really

380
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,424
There we go

381
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:02,752
Not really title or you want really those not really a title

382
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:07,104
Okay yeah they just are allergic to titles after Wars

383
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,432
They can't no one will own a title

384
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:15,808
I mean if you if you have a title that you are responsible for the thing that that title does right

385
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,344
That's legally dicey

386
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,744
Rob dues the news director and tell anyone ask him about it so much

387
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,048
He's just kind of a consultant at Large

388
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:32,704
What Alex on the company and tell her I don't

389
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,568
Company that he also owns

390
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,104
I find that

391
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,872
Again

392
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:44,992
To be Shady the title

393
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,808
I was genuinely excited because I was like finally

394
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:51,392
I get to know what H&R means in this context

395
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,440
And immediately the rug is Pulp

396
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,232
Madden really do that what

397
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:58,816
Not what you talkin about know he did do it now I know

398
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,120
But that wasn't a Time

399
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:11,872
So don't expect to buy.

400
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,664
And I take it that

401
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,968
From 2013 through the present day

402
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,760
Your responsibilities have evolved

403
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,528
Thursday

404
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,088
It's been a full-time engaged

405
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,648
But what you done during

406
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,328
In the sense that anyone

407
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,096
Job change

408
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,120
Overtime

409
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,400
There are vagaries

410
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,936
Alright bottom day today

411
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,704
Resultant

412
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,728
Challenges

413
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,776
I'm asking me and lie about your principles

414
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,824
What would I like to do then

415
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:42,848
There is two

416
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,128
Describe for me

417
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,664
From 2000s

418
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,944
In 13 going forward

419
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224
What your

420
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,016
Responsibilities have been

421
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,928
Largely just to be sure we have a good environment for our employees

422
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,232
That where

423
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,000
Compliance

424
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:02,048
2 state and federal guidelines

425
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,072
Unsend that we do

426
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,352
Business properly

427
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:07,680
I do a little bit of this

428
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,752
That is the most non-answer you can get

429
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:13,312
But it but it feels like an answer sort of

430
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,872
Have your responsibilities change

431
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:19,712
Insofar as life brings change to us all

432
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,248
On a daily basis

433
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:27,136
Orange balls from the branch

434
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,440
Listen to poetry

435
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,000
Everybody call me

436
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:36,864
Yeah but it's it's it's tough to break

437
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,680
What do this what do you do

438
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:46,336
On a daily give our point out give me a rundown of your day I like

439
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:49,920
I got to make sure that our employees are in a good state

440
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:56,320
9:51 I make sure that

441
00:24:56,576 --> 00:25:00,672
State of being h

442
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:07,072
I think this next clip sums up some of that stuff a little bit but also don't expect

443
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,656
So is that true generally of the other

444
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,448
Areas of the business day

445
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,472
You are awesome

446
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,520
Involved in

447
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,824
Solving problems as they arise

448
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,640
Our business

449
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,664
Is a

450
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,712
Single Talent business

451
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,504
The Distributing by one party

452
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,296
And I endeavor

453
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,088
To take care of some of

454
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:29,856
The delegate

455
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,624
It duties

456
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,416
It's not convenient

457
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,696
Should be done by the pro

458
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,704
Who do you report to

459
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,264
Airport

460
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,800
To Alex if anyone

461
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,360
Who else reports directly to Alex

462
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,896
Everyone

463
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:53,920
Okay

464
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:56,224
Alright so everyone reports to Alex

465
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,808
He is to be the sort of all roads lead to Alex Wright

466
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,600
And

467
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,904
So you you don't understand we were saying

468
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:10,304
Well I understand that what he was saying was you know AJ does everything and what he doesn't do I do

469
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,144
Is inconvenient for him

470
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,776
What do you do I get what you're saying

471
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,056
But right

472
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,872
You're forcing me to infer

473
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:30,272
So much of your responsibilities by saying you know he does everything and when he doesn't do something I pray

474
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:35,392
What is it exactly that is inconvenient for Alex to do

475
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,208
He's a single Talent

476
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,792
This is very annoying little frustrated

477
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:45,120
I'm screaming in my head didn't tell me what you do

478
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:50,240
So we may not find out exactly what they do or he does

479
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:56,640
But another thing we don't find out is how much he makes a that is because Norm is insisted he don't say

480
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,200
Are you currently employed by free speech

481
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,224
Yes

482
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,504
In the same capacity

483
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,088
And what's your salary

484
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,392
Necessary.

485
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:10,976
Everybody.

486
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,256
It's okay here's what I'd like to

487
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,072
I'd like to write it down

488
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,608
And give it to you

489
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,632
Borders at

490
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,168
Given the way

491
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:19,936
Read some of the depth

492
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,216
Have been publicized

493
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,080
So what I'd like to

494
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,360
I can write that number

495
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,456
Republic

496
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:38,112
This is agreed to am so his salary is written down on a piece of paper or something

497
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,904
It said it's not revealed

498
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,464
My instinct about that meat

499
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,768
Feels like it's probably a lot then right

500
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:51,168
Absolutely I don't think it would necessarily need to be something that is Fox to keep under

501
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,960
Raps if it's a normal salary

502
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,240
I mean

503
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,776
Let's go to the tape

504
00:27:56,288 --> 00:28:02,432
How long how many zeros did he rig you can see the little swirly motion with his hand right how many zeros did he

505
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:08,832
Right on that I'll be the paper believe it was probably written down during the break while they were off the Record so it's not not on film

506
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:15,232
Yeah cuz they they go to a break after this request is made until the actual tape stops

507
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:19,840
Fix backup well if it's okay for us to find out that

508
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:23,168
Owen and Daria make an absurd amount of money for being shity

509
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,496
Then I'm I'm guessing David makes well over $1000000

510
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,032
I'm sure they pay him

511
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,056
An absurd amount

512
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,848
Being the fact that

513
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:34,688
You know he has the interest in pqp yard and like

514
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,224
He knows every

515
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,248
Everything

516
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:42,112
It just API feels like the whatever compensation he has got to be like

517
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:48,768
I mean obviously if I were normal probably like

518
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:51,328
Okay I definitely don't tell him that you got to

519
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,608
Massive bonus

520
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:57,728
Right before the deposition do not reveal that you received several million dollars

521
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,544
Hours before you walked into this courtroom

522
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:04,640
Get to talkin about

523
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,432
Employee handbook

524
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,576
Inexplicably it does and then there's a there's a revelation here

525
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:15,392
Free Speech systems has an employee handbook correct

526
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,928
When did that

527
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:17,696
How come you doing

528
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,768
It and its permutations

529
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,048
For a long time

530
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,608
4:40

531
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,912
We got there

532
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,704
Do you know who drafted it

533
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,056
Probably

534
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,592
Holman talvin

535
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:37,920
Doesn't

536
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,248
Holman

537
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,552
Taube

538
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,720
They merged

539
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:52,768
Waller

540
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,304
Okay

541
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:57,888
And then

542
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:58,912
McQ

543
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,192
Come on board

544
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,984
You said that employee handbook his head

545
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,008
Different permutation

546
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,544
We

547
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,128
As we became larger

548
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,176
When you have 50 or more employees

549
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,712
Is there other DDS you have

550
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,736
Open so we elect

551
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:13,760
2

552
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,808
Co employee Free Speech Electric

553
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,832
Medical employee with

554
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,112
ADP total

555
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,184
Okay

556
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:21,952
What

557
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:23,744
What does that mean

558
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,328
It means that

559
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,608
We

560
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,960
Have a partner in rhr

561
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,240
Development in

562
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,776
Administration

563
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,336
That is a division of ADP

564
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,640
That

565
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,176
Call employees are employed

566
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,760
Forgive me

567
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,088
What is ADP

568
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:52,928
The largest data processing company in the world

569
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,464
That does payroll

570
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,488
Okay

571
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,280
They provided a coffee

572
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,560
Dysfunctional process

573
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:01,632
Payroll for employment to help assure compliance

574
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,400
Swift

575
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,704
But did he leave

576
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,520
Employment handbook issues

577
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,544
Notice

578
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,872
And process do you have a

579
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,456
Point of contact

580
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:17,248
At ADP that you deal with

581
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,296
Yeah we have on

582
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,064
Corporate

583
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,600
Preventative and I don't remember what her

584
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,368
Her name is

585
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,160
Okay so you don't deal with it

586
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,720
So this

587
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,744
Is

588
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,560
I like what a human resources department would do

589
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:36,960
Yeah and they've outsourced that the ADP ADP basically does all of this stuff

590
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,752
Person there and the

591
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:44,896
Presumed HR person at Infowars Alex's dad doesn't know her name and hasn't talked to her in a while doesn't really

592
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:49,248
What is the human resource I really want to stress this

593
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,528
Mr. Jones

594
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,552
A great deal

595
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,600
What do you do

596
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:56,928
What do you do

597
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:03,328
So much of what is been in my experience in places that I work what the HR department does your

598
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,120
Describing is ADP

599
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,400
You are

600
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:09,216
So you're telling me is that you don't have a job

601
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:12,032
Because you contract that job out to another company

602
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:18,688
And I'm just now finding this out and I've never heard of this other company before we're on year how many of us suing you

603
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:27,904
It sounds like that would be stuffing be inconvenient for Alex to do today

604
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:34,304
Staying in touch with ADP to be on top of the human resources

605
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:39,424
Stuff that they do that also be inconvenient for Alex Price

606
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,728
Very confusing what do you do sir

607
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:48,384
Not expect an answer I am shaking him by the shoulders

608
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,480
Until it had walked back and forth not going to help him

609
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:56,320
So will you talkin about marketing strategies

610
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:00,928
And this is B there's an interesting bit of phrasing work

611
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,208
It's done here

612
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,744
My correct sir that

613
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,048
You are

614
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,328
Personally

615
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,632
Familiar

616
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:10,656
With

617
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,472
Free Speech systems

618
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,032
Marketing and business policies

619
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,896
To the extent that they exist yet

620
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,456
And

621
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:24,992
What

622
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:25,760
Your

623
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,344
Personally familiar

624
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,368
With

625
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,160
Free Speech systems

626
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,184
Marking busy

627
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:33,952
Strategies

628
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,720
Correct

629
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,512
Free speech

630
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,536
SMS marketing

631
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,840
To the extent that

632
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,608
Today exist

633
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,680
So

634
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:47,776
I'm not saying that they exist but if they do I know about him

635
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:50,592
I mean

636
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:53,664
I I know about

637
00:33:53,920 --> 00:34:00,064
The inner workings of elrond's council as well but it does not really exist no does it so I can't really be

638
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:06,464
Be held responsible for what elrond's council does contraire

639
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,256
Responsible

640
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:11,840
This seems like

641
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:18,240
Real nice and on answer answer again because the answer even if to the extent they exist is Acura

642
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,288
Even if that is an accurate answer than the answers

643
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:29,504
To the extent they exist exist in

644
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,136
Into your answers I think that is what are the policies

645
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:38,720
Do the extent that they exist suggest

646
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,536
Thing exists

647
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,560
Somewhere

648
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:43,584
What is it

649
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,376
Maybe what is the thing that exists

650
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:51,008
We won't know immediately but we do know that

651
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,056
There was a sworn

652
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:53,824
Statement

653
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,104
That David Jones sign

654
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,408
Had to do with elements

655
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,944
Of the marketing plan

656
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,992
That are confidential

657
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,272
Okay

658
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:07,904
Okay I'm so mad Maddie wants to know what about this

659
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,464
Is confidential and proprietary

660
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,000
And boy this is annoying

661
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,816
Don't you take a look at paragraph 11

662
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:15,840
Your declaration

663
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,984
Starting with that second Center

664
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:26,080
I am aware that plaintiff seek information in.

665
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:26,848
And occupy

666
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,872
Among other things

667
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,432
Related to the business and marketing plan

668
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,760
And I just want to skip to the end of the above entity

669
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,040
Right

670
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:39,904
So I want to focus specifically on business and marketing plans

671
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:44,000
Hell of the above entities

672
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,304
Some of those above entities down

673
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,376
That didn't really exist or have any marketing plan

674
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,656
Turn off I'll get to that

675
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:51,936
But I just want it

676
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,216
Make sure that we are

677
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,752
Operating with the same

678
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,824
You are where this time

679
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:00,384
That the police were seeking information

680
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,408
And documents

681
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,688
Related to free speech

682
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,712
Systems

683
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:06,016
Free Speech systems business and marketing

684
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:06,784
That's right

685
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,832
And

686
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,136
That information am I correct

687
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,208
You were tested with confidential and proprietary

688
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:14,976
Correct

689
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,024
It was my intent

690
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:22,912
Testify that some of that could be proprietary that there was confidential information such

691
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,704
People's names address

692
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,240
Two Social Security numbers

693
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,544
And thanks Cuz off and on our tips line

694
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,104
People would use that as a means of getting through to cuss

695
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,384
Customer service they thought it was

696
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:34,432
Quicker pipeline to effect

697
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,480
Listen often times there was information

698
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:43,392
That we were prohibited from sharing with people and it's my concern that was going to be scattered all over the known universe

699
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,440
Information would be contained in a business

700
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,208
World Market

701
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,232
Correct

702
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,304
Shouldn't be

703
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,120
Right

704
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,936
You were tested am I correct

705
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,984
That information

706
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:00,288
Regarding the business and marketing plans

707
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:03,104
A free speech systems with confidential and proprietary

708
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:03,872
Correct

709
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:08,736
That seems reasonable to me and highly valuable

710
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:09,760
Capri's Pizza

711
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,528
Correct

712
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,368
Well if you don't know how to do business

713
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,136
You can't do busy

714
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,696
Soap

715
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:18,976
So

716
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:19,744
Tell me what

717
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,280
The business

718
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,304
Plan

719
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,840
Or plans were

720
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,912
That you were referring to as confidential proprietary highly

721
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:32,288
Essentially our core philosophy

722
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,312
Sophie is what was

723
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:38,176
Jesus involved and I don't know that I really should have been concerned because it

724
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,712
It's probably not articulated

725
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,992
Ty perine

726
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,320
What the f*** is going on

727
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,368
So

728
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:52,768
Let me let me ask you what you took away from that and see see how you are processing information

729
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,560
Alright so here's our strategy

730
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,352
When a thing happened

731
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,144
We reacted make people mad

732
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:01,728
But if you write that down people be like that

733
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:08,128
That makes you sound like an evil person who's trying to make people angry so we keep it all in our heads buddy there's no no

734
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,408
Marketing strategy

735
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:12,480
Expensive just screaming at you maybe maybe

736
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,760
Your clothes

737
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:21,440
Something that's mildlyinfuriating about this back-and-forth and how this goes it's like

738
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,488
Are sworn declaration that you made here

739
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:27,328
It says that there are parts of the marketing and business plan

740
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,376
That are confidential and proprietary

741
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:36,032
What is that mean well you know some people use r or tipline as a put another put the credit card information

742
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,360
Has nothing to do with the business plan

743
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:42,688
Nope certainly not I guess it shouldn't be in there

744
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,968
Well

745
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,016
Look it's just an idea

746
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,552
It's just

747
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:50,368
And maybe it's not confidential maybe I

748
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:57,536
Yeah that's not even on paper and maybe it's just our core philosophy

749
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:01,120
That maybe it's not on paper

750
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:03,424
Is a misunderstanding of a business

751
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:09,824
No I recognized that perhaps they didn't go to a to a Traditional Bank

752
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,616
In order to get a small business loan

753
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:15,200
That's requiring it a a suite of business plan

754
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:19,040
Necessary to present in order to get that loan right under stand that

755
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:21,344
Alex's dad Baltimore show

756
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,648
Which is a nice way to do it if you

757
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,416
You can do it

758
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:28,768
But I'm pretty sure you still have to write down a business plan sooner or later

759
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:31,584
If you want

760
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:34,912
Well here is what this boils down to

761
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:38,752
The primary philosophy that may or may not be confidential

762
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,568
Essentially our core philosophy

763
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,336
What was

764
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:47,200
Jesus involved and I don't know that I really should have been concerned because it's

765
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,736
It's probably not articulated

766
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,016
Ty perine

767
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:57,440
But in reality it has to do with the fact that our customers are so loyal to us that they believe in what we're doing today

768
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,464
Such a degree

769
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,072
Did if we say something is good for you in as a good value they're going to buy it and buy a lot of

770
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:07,424
And you know you don't really

771
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,032
It's it's hard to articulate that but it's it let the core of the heart of things can

772
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,336
Can sometimes be very simple and very valuable

773
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,384
Understood

774
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,152
Pedigree

775
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,944
The business plan

776
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,480
Well I think what you just

777
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,504
Scribus

778
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,296
A component of the

779
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:26,624
But that there is no written

780
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,392
Business

781
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:28,928
Plan

782
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:30,976
Pertaining

783
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:36,096
There is a business plan but it's in Alex Jones is

784
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,376
Moosehead

785
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,424
Is there any written business

786
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,984
No probably not okay

787
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:48,384
So Alex has an idea of his head of how things are supposed to go and then it's never a reticulated

788
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,664
Put on paper anywhere

789
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,504
Find this believable I appreciate that what he essentially

790
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,552
Danced around there was like

791
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,088
We lie

792
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,368
We lied to that

793
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,392
Because

794
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:02,464
They believe what we say about other s***

795
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,864
Yeah then we lied to them about our products business plan is our audience will buy whatever we tell them

796
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:15,264
Exactly that's our business so captured them and trap them in an alternate reality that they view US

797
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,032
As a source

798
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:18,592
For all reliable information

799
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:24,992
Thereby making our bulshit products so much easier to sell them literally anyone else on this f******

800
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:29,856
Play Jim Jones didn't have a f****** business plan

801
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:35,488
So there's still the question of like what is confidential and proprietary

802
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,560
David will not be specific

803
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,352
You are also aware

804
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,120
That

805
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,704
The plaintiffs were seeking

806
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,776
Information and documents pertaining to the Free Speech systems

807
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,312
Marketing data

808
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,104
In sales

809
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,384
Analytics

810
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:53,407
And what

811
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,455
Yes

812
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:56,991
Would you

813
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,527
Described as competition

814
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,295
Proprietary

815
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,575
Cracked heels

816
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:04,159
What marketing data in particular

817
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:06,719
He's confident

818
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,999
Proprietary

819
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,535
That priest

820
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,655
The core

821
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:15,935
Facts of

822
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,775
What are prices are for things what it cost

823
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,543
Dubai

824
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,359
Materials

825
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:24,895
We sell per year

826
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:28,223
What stages we sell those to and things of that

827
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,759
Any any business

828
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:30,783
As trade secret

829
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:31,807
Okay

830
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,599
And you consider that to be

831
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,391
Marketing data

832
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,695
I probably would but I don't

833
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,487
I don't look at

834
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:40,511
I understand

835
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:41,791
And the

836
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:44,607
Different pricing what do you do

837
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,375
And

838
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:49,983
Profit margins do you consider that to be included within sales Analytics

839
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,799
I don't know

840
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:53,823
What the definition

841
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,847
Can-Am sales Analytics

842
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,919
It's like what it is

843
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:58,943
To cover a hole mole

844
00:42:59,199 --> 00:42:59,711
Potato sand

845
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,503
It's hard to know what it may

846
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,783
Understood

847
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,575
And I also understand that

848
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,599
Perhaps you didn't

849
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:10,719
Prepare the first draft of this declaration but this is the term that you swore to

850
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:15,583
And you made me certain representations about in your declaration take

851
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,607
So

852
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,143
What I want to know is

853
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,935
When you swore this document

854
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,263
Did you understand sales Analytics

855
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,823
Include the things I just described for you

856
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:26,847
Pricing

857
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,383
Pricing trends

858
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,663
Profit margins

859
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,199
Dad of that nature

860
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:31,967
Not enough

861
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:32,735
Sterling

862
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,551
Okay not necessarily

863
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,599
Did you in fact

864
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:40,159
Consider that to be included within sales anywhere

865
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:40,927
When I'm asked

866
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,951
Jessica General Quest

867
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,231
Something's Express

868
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:46,303
In general terms I doesn't necessarily include the

869
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,071
Specifics

870
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:50,399
That's what I'm asking you is what in your mind

871
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:53,471
Was included in the term sales analytics when you included here

872
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:57,311
The reasonable connotations that a reasonable man would have

873
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,615
And you are reasonable man so you tell me

874
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,383
What is a

875
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,151
Included

876
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,175
I'm not going to

877
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:03,967
Norm

878
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,247
So why don't we

879
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,271
Take a brief break

880
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:11,647
Let's infuriate playing tennis against the drapes as they say

881
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,183
We

882
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:16,255
Frustrating as as a Daria

883
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:18,559
Deposition was

884
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:22,911
Because she was in many ways this she was trying to do this

885
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,703
Because she's

886
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,751
Weird evil psychopath

887
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:33,151
Yeah we came off like she was a weird evil psychopath who is like occasionally like I'm not going to answer that and then stepping into the Trap

888
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:38,015
Yeah he's just slippery enough he's annoying

889
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:39,039
It's not like

890
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:43,135
I'm soap I hate you it's more just like man

891
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:47,487
I swear to God that one more

892
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:53,887
There's only so much work I dare you to say that this isn't on me

893
00:44:54,143 --> 00:45:00,287
Mrs. in front of God and the law there is only so much one man can take sir that I have

894
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:04,127
Have from the past couple questions and answers that I feel like I might be onto something here

895
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:08,735
So when David is talking about the things that are secret and proprietary Trade Secrets

896
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:15,135
I think he's specifically just talkin about the profit margins they make on things that they sell and how much money the business brings in

897
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:22,047
This is the information that he didn't ever wanted enforce desperately doesn't want to be made public because if it does that threaten

898
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:24,095
The stability of what David is described

899
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:26,655
Is the primary business plan the company has

900
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:30,239
Their entire marketing strategy relies on the audience

901
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,519
Trusting Alex

902
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:38,175
They've been suckered into believing that they exist in this false reality where the globalist are coming to get them and the only hope they have is this

903
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:40,223
Does Lombre voice in Texas

904
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:46,623
He's on a mission directly given to him by God against agents of the literal devil and God has granted Alex discern

905
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,159
Ornamented inside of the things

906
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,207
That are Beyond normal Mortals

907
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:54,559
So when Alex tells you that you need water filtration systems to combat the globalist

908
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:56,351
Trying to poison you with fluoride

909
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,655
The audience is likely to believe that

910
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:05,055
What Alex tells them that they need to take a special iodine to give themselves a higher IQ which is only lower because of global

911
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,591
Blister deprive them of iodine

912
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,383
The audience Buys in

913
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:13,503
Hippie audience's faith in Alex's shaken these propositions would start to sound dumb

914
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:16,575
So it's pretty critical to protect Alex's image at all cost

915
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:21,439
Certain things are acceptable to acknowledge like Alex's problem with alcohol because

916
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:27,071
He could use that to peel even more to the audience as an imperfect vessel doing the Lord's work

917
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,351
On the other hand

918
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:32,959
If you audience were to actually understand the financial underpinnings of enforcing Free Speech systems

919
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:38,335
And they realize the scam Alex has been running on them for over a decade

920
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,383
That's a bit harder to defend

921
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:47,039
Did the audience understood the millions of dollars Alex takes out of the business for himself if they saw his ridiculous houses and lavish

922
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:47,807
Lifestyle

923
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:50,367
If they know what he spent on luxury if they

924
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:54,463
New how high is profit margins were on the b******* placebos that he sells them

925
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:58,047
Vacaville High Chancellor Road in the trust that the audience is put in

926
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,583
It was out that there is no business

927
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,119
I think that this is

928
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,399
More or less

929
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:06,495
If you read between the lines kind of what David to say

930
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:11,103
I don't know I feel like it might be against

931
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,895
The law but it could not

932
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:15,199
Because we live in hellscape

933
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:15,967
But

934
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:18,015
If what I'm hearing is correct

935
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:21,599
He doesn't want to give the actual cost

936
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:25,951
That they spend on the stuff that actual profit margin was right Terry

937
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:26,975
Proprietary

938
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,511
But more importantly

939
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:34,655
Alex says that s*** on the show all the f****** times Drew so if that stuff is not true

940
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:41,055
If he's constantly repeating we're giving you the best prices on the Bubba blah

941
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:47,455
50% speak in specifics on there too

942
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:53,855
Question for the the Federal Trade Commission true

943
00:47:54,111 --> 00:48:00,255
Would be it would be manipulative advertising false advertising perhaps advertising

944
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:06,143
Interesting question that again the FTC might have some thoughts about why the

945
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:11,775
Big crimes that caused all the problems aren't crimes except for they make all the money and then you can buy the government to make them legal

946
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,079
Yeah that's it that's all

947
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:17,151
The flaw in the system

948
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:19,455
So I think the

949
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:23,295
I think that this is the dynamic really that's going on is that like

950
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:27,647
If the audience understand that the business aspect of this

951
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,671
Is

952
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:30,975
Thought you manipulating and using them

953
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:31,999
Essentially

954
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:34,047
They lose faith in that

955
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:37,375
Then there is no more money coming in and this whole thing goes

956
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:44,799
Even if they believe us about the globalist in these like other things like even if that is retained

957
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:49,919
Then this whole thing collapses and the business the market of it

958
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:52,223
Is no longer workable

959
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:55,807
He's basically saying our business philosophy is fraud

960
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:07,839
Holy water

961
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:10,143
Is the church is that what you want to hear

962
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:12,959
So this next clip involves

963
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:19,359
Has played in the trial itself to say about

964
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:23,199
Ambulating spikes oh yeah I remember that were you aware weather

965
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:24,991
Free Speech systems

966
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,295
Collects data

967
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,063
Concerning

968
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:33,439
When during an Alex Jones broadcast it has

969
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,743
Ammo sales activity

970
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:40,351
Only in the sense

971
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:44,703
That if there have been days where we had extraordinary good sales

972
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:45,727
Someone will

973
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:46,751
Say what was Alex

974
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,031
Saying when that happen

975
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,055
And so we liked

976
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:49,823
Emulates

977
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:50,591
Spikes

978
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,407
And so that would be done on the Fly

979
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,687
But it's not done

980
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,967
By any Analytics

981
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:56,735
You would think Ivan

982
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:57,759
Terms of a

983
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:00,575
Right so that there's data that

984
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:05,951
Free Speech has available that show that can chew a spike in activity

985
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:06,719
And

986
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,815
Theoretically that would be pause

987
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:13,887
Possible to do if you need

988
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,679
Then someone who had access

989
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,703
To Analytics

990
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,471
To go in and

991
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:18,495
Determined

992
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,287
And on those

993
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:22,079
Occasions where there have been

994
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,383
Spikes in sales

995
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,943
As you said that's something that

996
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:31,295
Yes

997
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:34,111
Well that's unfortunate combined with

998
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:40,511
The clear data that exists that there was a gigantic Spike

999
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:46,911
You bet and sales after Wolfgang halbig was on and after they put that the day they posted that article

1000
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:47,935
Call about the FBI

1001
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:50,239
Saying that no one died at Sandy Hook

1002
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:52,799
And so on

1003
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:59,967
I mean those two things put together without from

1004
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:05,087
I don't think anybody else it in fours would have said that

1005
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:05,855
That

1006
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,135
To this point it's

1007
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:10,463
Fairly clear that David is baby kgs of them all

1008
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:16,863
And he's capable of slippery slope in his early 20s flipping through a lot of little little

1009
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,143
Cracks in the in the fist

1010
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:22,495
But I don't know how he revealed may be the most important line

1011
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:28,895
Many of these episode have a thought about that and I think that's because he didn't know what was in some of

1012
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:35,295
The emails like turning over access

1013
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:40,671
I still like Google analytics data and stuff like that and withholding certain things

1014
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:42,463
But the snapshots

1015
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:47,071
Like Google analytics reports that were

1016
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,239
Are there

1017
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:59,615
And so this doesn't seem like that threatening of a thing to say why wouldn't you

1018
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:04,735
If you were doing a business why wouldn't you lean into the things that work basically

1019
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:11,135
And if you assume that you're not getting the information on what exactly work

1020
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:11,903
When

1021
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:14,975
Then yeah you just say something that seems reasonable

1022
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:21,119
Of course and unfortunately in concert with the the information that is available

1023
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,143
This just

1024
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,679
Literally says

1025
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:25,215
Well of course

1026
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:31,615
We would recreate because it was profitable

1027
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:36,479
Yeah we are being what I'm saying to you is if something makes a lot of money I eat

1028
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:37,503
Sandy Hook coverage

1029
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:42,111
Then we would continue to do it there for making more money now

1030
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:49,791
So part of the business is investment in supplements inasmuch as like you got to

1031
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:54,655
Yeah I got to get a new formulation you've got to invest in the creation of the supplement

1032
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:59,775
And sometimes they pay off sometimes they don't leaving aside the fact that

1033
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:03,615
Most of the products that Alex ends up selling or just private labeling of

1034
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:05,151
Already existing product

1035
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:11,551
Yeah there isn't really that what they talking about we invest in

1036
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:14,111
Product development I think if

1037
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:17,695
I think what he's trying to say is centrally is that like

1038
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:22,559
You know you maybe buy a lot in bulk and then sometime something doesn't sell

1039
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:24,095
That's what he said

1040
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,631
Yeah

1041
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:27,423
You can parse this yourself

1042
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:29,215
You you said

1043
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,239
In

1044
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,799
Paragraph 13

1045
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:34,079
That

1046
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,407
Free Speech systems had

1047
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:43,551
Invested significant resources into into developing

1048
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:45,343
Their business and marketing

1049
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:48,159
Strategy so my question for you is

1050
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:53,279
Can you describe the level of investment into those strategies and windows in Bessemer

1051
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:55,839
Let's side developing

1052
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:56,863
A new product

1053
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,655
Cost two hundred

1054
00:53:58,911 --> 00:53:59,423
Thousand dollars

1055
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:01,471
If it doesn't sell well you basically

1056
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,495
Delete that are high

1057
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:03,775
Sell it at wholesale

1058
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:08,895
And so you learn the hard way certain things sell and certain things don't say

1059
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,967
Right I see so

1060
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:14,527
Free Speech systems actually

1061
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:17,087
Pays to develop the product

1062
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,111
Sales on a store

1063
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:21,183
And those Investments have

1064
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,719
Risen on the order of hundred thousand

1065
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:23,487
Dollars

1066
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,511
With respect sir

1067
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:25,279
Products

1068
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:28,863
Those would be the minimum

1069
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,143
Minimum cost

1070
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:32,959
Generally I mean no smallest thing you can do in bike cost

1071
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:34,239
Effectively probably in

1072
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:38,079
Thirty-two $50,000 category but it's hardly worth

1073
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:39,615
Stafford to do it so they

1074
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:40,639
Substantial

1075
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:41,663
Amount of risk involved

1076
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:43,199
Producing a product

1077
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:43,967
If it doesn't

1078
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,527
And Soto

1079
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:47,807
The

1080
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,391
Providing

1081
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:53,439
Dad and information about those

1082
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:55,231
Business and marketing strategies

1083
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:56,767
What results in peeling

1084
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,815
The wells invest

1085
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,375
Yes that's true too

1086
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,911
And I was hoping that you

1087
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:04,703
I was hoping this time too

1088
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:05,471
Prevent fungus

1089
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:09,311
It sounds a little paranoid but

1090
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,079
But there are

1091
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,103
Certain

1092
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,151
Political

1093
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:14,687
Grapes

1094
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:15,455
That

1095
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:16,735
Have some in the

1096
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:17,503
Anteater

1097
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,271
Our

1098
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:21,599
Platform which is primarily

1099
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:25,183
Informational we radiologically driven and we want to

1100
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,207
Promote a message

1101
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:27,231
It has to do with

1102
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:29,279
Traditional American values

1103
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:32,607
And we believe that there are people that would like

1104
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:33,631
To put us out of business

1105
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,167
And we think that

1106
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:37,215
Of the knowledge of

1107
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:38,239
What are true

1108
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:39,263
Financial

1109
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,287
Condition is

1110
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,567
Could be used for harm

1111
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:42,591
Interested

1112
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:48,991
So there's a couple of ways that you could interpret that that if people knew what their actual

1113
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,271
Financial State was

1114
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,295
Is it could lead to harm

1115
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:56,159
You could think that means like well if people knew how poorly they were doing

1116
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:58,719
They're in that they were that close to the edge

1117
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,511
That it would hurt them

1118
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:01,791
I don't think that makes

1119
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:08,447
You could interpret it as if people knew how well they were doing it could hurt them because that could

1120
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,983
To be used against them as a

1121
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:12,799
Look at this pile of cash they have

1122
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:15,103
And I think that's a possibility but actually

1123
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,127
I think

1124
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:20,735
Taking this as a thought that branches off of the supplement

1125
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:22,527
Conversation and stuff

1126
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:23,807
I think

1127
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:27,903
That what he's actually saying is more to the effect of

1128
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:34,047
If they knew who we private labeled from they could put pressure on them and they wouldn't allow us to sell the product

1129
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:38,143
I think that that's more like what what we're going out here

1130
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:44,543
Because Alex knows that you can't take sponsors and stuff because unless they're like Mike Lindell

1131
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:45,567
Somebody who's like

1132
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:46,335
Already

1133
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:48,895
Superfriend gym and immune from

1134
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:55,295
Any kind of push back that comes from it and I have to assume that some of these companies

1135
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,319
If it were public

1136
00:56:56,575 --> 00:57:00,927
That he's private labeling their products and telling them they would terminate that agreement

1137
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:05,791
As opposed to withstanding the kind of criticism

1138
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:06,559
But they would get

1139
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:08,607
I think that that's what David saying

1140
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:09,631
In this

1141
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:16,031
Yeah it can't be it can't be that he think obviously it's not people knew that we were doing poorly because

1142
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:18,335
You combine that with the political thing

1143
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:20,639
Then what would happen if she's describing people

1144
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,407
Clowning on

1145
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:28,063
You know they mock them that wouldn't be that wouldn't be damaging to them that I could be advantageous exact in some

1146
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,879
Subway's because the audience would rally to the aid of

1147
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:32,927
Of their Heroes

1148
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:37,535
The only the only possibilities as far as this question is concerned is

1149
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:41,887
If people knew what we were doing and how well we were doing

1150
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:42,911
They would try and stop

1151
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:47,263
So the less they know about what we're doing and how well we're doing

1152
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:48,543
The less people bother us

1153
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:53,919
It does it feels like it could be that whatever it is it's like a nice or something

1154
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:55,455
So

1155
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:57,247
The dynamic

1156
00:57:57,503 --> 00:58:00,575
Of covering things because they

1157
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:01,599
Drive

1158
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,879
Sales and stuff

1159
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:05,183
Comes up the part of the crime

1160
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:07,999
And are you aware that

1161
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,839
Of circumstances were in those occasions

1162
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:13,887
There was a spike in Revenue that

1163
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:17,983
It was decided by Alex

1164
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:19,007
Perhaps others

1165
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,031
They would try to

1166
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,591
Recreate that Spike by

1167
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:25,407
Covering the same story or returning to the same story

1168
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:26,175
No I'm not aware

1169
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,199
Okay

1170
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:28,735
That's just something that you into it

1171
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:29,759
Would have happened

1172
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:32,319
Just something I've observed

1173
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:34,367
Wait

1174
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:36,415
So you've observed it but you're not aware of it

1175
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:38,719
In that regard

1176
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,375
I've observed

1177
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:46,399
For example if

1178
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,423
People are being

1179
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:48,447
Stressed out

1180
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:52,543
About the idea of there being very dangerous flu thing

1181
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:53,311
Things out there

1182
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:54,591
And stuff and we

1183
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,151
Found that there is a

1184
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,175
Product it is

1185
00:58:58,943 --> 00:58:59,967
License PDF

1186
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:01,503
FDA to be a good Surfer

1187
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:02,783
Infection

1188
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:04,063
And actually you can

1189
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,855
Can make claims along those lines

1190
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,903
If there is a

1191
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,439
Headline that they

1192
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:13,535
Disease Control Atlanta as Center Atlanta is saying

1193
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:15,327
Please up five times

1194
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:17,631
Send Wayside we have something that we believe will

1195
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,399
Sport near me

1196
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:22,751
And I personally use it as a hand sanitizer

1197
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:25,311
You know that's kind of puff resale

1198
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:28,639
Puffery Soule

1199
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:32,223
Now this is interesting because this isn't 2019

1200
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:34,271
It's right as before

1201
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:41,695
We know from watching the way the covid is covered and the way that Alex tries to sell the sea

1202
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:42,463
Silver product

1203
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:46,559
It matches up very closely and very well with

1204
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:47,583
This puffery

1205
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,887
David Jones might say

1206
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:50,911
And

1207
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:52,959
I mean he's not saying that

1208
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:57,567
But the way ilex did sell those products that you can make claims about

1209
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:58,591
Was fraudulent

1210
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:03,711
Yep he was mixing up his internally taken silver with the topical

1211
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:04,991
Silver

1212
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:09,599
In terms of its ability to protect or or ward off viruses

1213
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,623
I have this

1214
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:11,391
My friend

1215
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:12,927
Not good

1216
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:15,231
Wow that is that is

1217
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,767
Just a vape

1218
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:18,303
Could not be more

1219
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,071
Clear

1220
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:23,679
After watching there will only be alone survivors followed by

1221
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:27,519
Call does it's all a lie you just need silver

1222
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:30,335
It's like well it's your your take

1223
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:31,103
Is

1224
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:36,479
Money that's your take on things

1225
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,527
That's what you need to do to get money

1226
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:46,207
Saudia the subject of Gunn fear comes up the Alex talking about they're going to take your guns all the

1227
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:50,559
Something that is

1228
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:53,119
Helpful to drive sales

1229
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:59,519
Write an interesting take on this shouldn't have

1230
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:04,127
And you can see him double back on us to strike the record

1231
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:05,407
And when

1232
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:06,431
Alex

1233
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,711
Discover stories

1234
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:08,479

1235
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:11,551
Amplify that

1236
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,319
Concern

1237
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:14,367
Has it been your experience that

1238
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:16,671
That increases

1239
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:18,975
Both traffic to the website

1240
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:21,023
And people find byproduct

1241
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:25,119
Counterintuitive but negative issues

1242
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,143
Is that are depressing

1243
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:27,167
Inara bummer

1244
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:27,935
Tender Hearts

1245
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:28,959
Hertz sales

1246
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,799
We sell a lot better when Alex

1247
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:33,823
Cheerful

1248
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:35,871
And enthused about every

1249
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:39,455
Everything and what winners we are when he's mad at the world because

1250
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:40,479
Screwed up

1251
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,527
We're losing our rights peep

1252
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:43,551
People tend not to buy

1253
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:46,879
And if you seen that borne out by the data

1254
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:47,903
Yes you have

1255
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:50,207
Best out of this maintained by

1256
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:51,999
Prepuce not maintain

1257
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:55,071
I would say it's anecdotal but I am pretty good on him

1258
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:55,839
Anecdotal

1259
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:57,375
Okay

1260
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,143
Okay

1261
01:01:58,655 --> 01:01:59,679
Wow

1262
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:06,079
That yes to the is there data is ago I f***** up obvious

1263
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:12,735
So obviously what a fun little what a fun little trap

1264
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:15,039
Okay all right those are good answer what are you doing

1265
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:18,111
Just constant little

1266
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:22,207
Sneaking in there and if you accidentally answer you revealed a lot more than you wanted

1267
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:29,375
Have you seen the data sir oh yeah there's sheets of anecdotal stories

1268
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:31,679
Dataprise

1269
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:38,079
Talking about manhood smooth smooth also if people buy more when Alex's happy maybe you should try being happy more

1270
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:44,479
Maybe they wouldn't be in such Financial Straits and wasn't screaming and threatening to go off pretty regularly

1271
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:45,503
It would be better tomorrow

1272
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:47,295
Maybe maybe

1273
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:51,647
Subject of mda's comes up non-disclosure agreements

1274
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:56,767
But everybody except Alex's dad apparently his hind

1275
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:58,815
Antenor

1276
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:03,679
Chimes in this play I want to talk a little bit about non-disclosure agreements

1277
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:04,447
When did

1278
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:07,775
Free Speech systems first start requiring employees to enter

1279
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:08,799
Nda's

1280
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:09,823
From the very beginning

1281
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:11,871
Have you signed an NDA

1282
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:15,455
Are there any other employees that you're aware of

1283
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:17,247
I would not find an Indian

1284
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:18,527
You the only one

1285
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:20,831
Define idiom

1286
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:25,951
When you say from the very beginning

1287
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,743
What are you

1288
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:28,767
What's the beginning for you

1289
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:30,303
Well the beginning tomatoes

1290
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,607
This when Alex moved out of his house

1291
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:33,631
And on Demaree

1292
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,935
And I don't know what year that was

1293
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:37,215
Probably 2,000

1294
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:38,239
Over 2,000

1295
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:41,311
And your understanding is that from that time

1296
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,871
He started requiring every employee hired by Prince

1297
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,479
Set 2005

1298
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:50,527
And that's a

1299
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:51,295
Ballpark

1300
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:54,367
Now that you could be two or three years

1301
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:55,135
Before after

1302
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:58,207
No I'm coming in with a I wasn't paying attention

1303
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:04,607
Fell asleep again my bad my bad listen I just hope I don't fall asleep in the courtroom or nothing I'm I right

1304
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:11,007
I'm on the ball

1305
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:11,775
Wilkinson

1306
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:20,735
So

1307
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:23,807
So Andy are pretty important

1308
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:30,463
When you don't want people talking s*** about how many fake stories you tell

1309
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:33,791
Are you lie about everything there's another reason

1310
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,351
Do you have an understanding yourself

1311
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:37,887
Why

1312
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:40,959
It is important to free speech systems to have

1313
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:43,263
Their employees under non-disclosure agreements

1314
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:48,127
It's a useful to communication tool

1315
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:49,151
What

1316
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,199
Particularly it is event

1317
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:52,735
Twisted people are making

1318
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:53,759
If people develop

1319
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:56,319
Let's just say mental health issues

1320
01:04:57,087 --> 01:05:00,159
And one of the things that waiting to get it back

1321
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:01,183
Offered

1322
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:02,975
Jacobson was

1323
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:04,511
Some psychological help.

1324
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:05,791
Because we thought he was knocking

1325
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:07,071
Congrat with reality

1326
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:09,119
And ultimately his EEOC

1327
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,143
Complaint was dismissed

1328
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:15,263
Okay so if I understand what you're saying is that

1329
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:16,543
One of the

1330
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:19,615
Things that a non-disclosure agreement

1331
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:22,943
Prevents is if somebody becomes mentally on

1332
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:23,711
Stable

1333
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:28,319
The company is protected from what they might say after they leave the company

1334
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:31,647
Right

1335
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:35,999
It's not too effective with people who aren't thinking well but if people are think

1336
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:36,767
Working well

1337
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:38,303
They can be aware that

1338
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,583
Did they have DVDs

1339
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:40,351
That could

1340
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,143
Have concert

1341
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:43,935
If they are improving

1342
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:45,983
The badass

1343
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:50,335
Just put it in basic terms isn't purpose of the nda's

1344
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,359
Happy's pizza stones used

1345
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,383
Prevent employees

1346
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:54,687
Disseminating information

1347
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:55,711
That is

1348
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:57,247
Proprietary to free speech systems

1349
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:58,271
Right

1350
01:05:59,039 --> 01:05:59,551
Yes

1351
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:05,951
I could put it that way instead of saying in case somebody has a mental health crisis as it can't weird

1352
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:10,303
Should about us later or something describing the reason

1353
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:16,703
That is completely fallacious because you're saying that if somebody has like a mental break

1354
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:18,495
Or whatever after they leave

1355
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:20,799
Then NBA is helpful for

1356
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:27,199
Getting them to not say bad things are not syncing correctly

1357
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:31,551
It's just it's nonsense this is such a

1358
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:38,207
I I mean I appreciate the true orwellian doublespeak of an NDA

1359
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:39,743
Is good for communication

1360
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:41,535
But I think it is

1361
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:48,191
Because it's communicating

1362
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:50,751
Very true

1363
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:56,895
So the subject of customers comes up and this got to bum me out a little bit

1364
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:58,431
Real sad

1365
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:02,271
Some of these customers have been been around for a long time

1366
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:03,295
Don't know

1367
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:05,855
A percentage in mind of what percentage of

1368
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:06,623
Free pizza

1369
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:08,159
Revenues derived

1370
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,695
From products tails

1371
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:10,719
Infowars store

1372
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:13,791
No

1373
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:15,327
Give a ballpark

1374
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:17,375
Possibly something like

1375
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:18,911
80% problem

1376
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:22,495
And then the remainder is comprised of

1377
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:23,263
Donations

1378
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:25,823
From processed through infowars.com

1379
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:27,871
Used to be from

1380
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:28,639
Description

1381
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:30,431
Services

1382
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:31,967
Some advertising

1383
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:35,295
You know

1384
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:40,927
The core customers are very important to us and one of the strange things that occurred

1385
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:43,999
When we were deplatformed everybody thought we would go away

1386
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:46,303
But many of those core of loyal

1387
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:47,327
Customer

1388
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:49,887
Mercer virus before they even knew what the internet was

1389
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:50,655
Bicycle

1390
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:52,959
So they either use

1391
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:54,495
Telephone numbers are

1392
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:55,775
New what iron

1393
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:59,871
Email address was or whatever

1394
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:00,895
I could do it

1395
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:01,919
But

1396
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:02,943
Deplatforming

1397
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:03,711
It's hardest with

1398
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:04,735
Acquisition

1399
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:05,503
A new customer

1400
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:06,783
Search engine

1401
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:07,807
Not only

1402
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:14,463
Don't send us they tell people they tell 2 billion people if you put link to Alex Jones run for

1403
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:18,303
And don't say you're doing it says you want to criticize him we're going to

1404
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:20,351
Take you down and kill you too

1405
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:25,215
Exaggerating a little bit no not at all

1406
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:26,239
Alright

1407
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:29,567
So much because I

1408
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:33,663
What he's saying is more or less like what I want deplatforming came around

1409
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:34,943
Everybody Talks

1410
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:37,247
We would go away but it turns out jokes on you

1411
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:43,647
We have people trapped even more tightly than you even imagine

1412
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:45,439
Why is all of our customers use

1413
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:50,303
Phone right at 4

1414
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:51,583
50 years yeah

1415
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:57,983
But he does Express something that I have made a point of a lot and that is the financial impact

1416
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:00,543
Of the deplatforming is largely going to be felt

1417
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:03,359
In the acquisition of new customers

1418
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:09,503
New people coming into his Revenue stream is hurt by the lack of Freedom frightened terms

1419
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,295
Disseminating content

1420
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:13,599
And these platforms

1421
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:18,207
I'm just by their very nature if you're not growing you are

1422
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:21,279
Drinking because there is a going to always

1423
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,047
Be

1424
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:28,447
A certain amount of people who get this illusion to turn right go on to hardcore stuff again sucked into

1425
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:29,727
The Q or whatever

1426
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:36,127
Your fanbase is never going to be static necessarily is if you are constantly adding new people in

1427
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:38,943
That it will eventually be entropy

1428
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:41,759
If you're going to lose

1429
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:48,159
No I mean it's it is nice to hear in the deposition of Alex Jones's father that we are

1430
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:49,183
The right to be so f******

1431
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:55,583
Hard on everybody when they won't stop platforming and that's what that he's the one explaining that that's how they get new

1432
01:09:55,839 --> 01:10:01,983
You f****** people right that's why the criticism is particularly harsh about people like Rogan

1433
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,007
Yep

1434
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:04,543
Make these

1435
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:07,103
Ill-advised

1436
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:14,783
People who share that f****** Bon Iver

1437
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:16,831
I'll do have f****** Cuban a doll thing

1438
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:17,599
Yeah

1439
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:20,927
He doesn't get new people anymore unless those

1440
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:23,743
Do you do it

1441
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:27,071
And you don't want to be one of those bags

1442
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:28,607
Yep

1443
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:30,399
Anyways anyway

1444
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:34,495
I was watching this and it doesn't

1445
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:36,287
Feel like Alex much

1446
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:38,591
Jesus dad

1447
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:40,639
Yeah and it doesn't feel like Alex

1448
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:41,407
That much

1449
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:47,039
His voice is much more measured Fairy look like

1450
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:47,807
Pauses

1451
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:54,207
Thoughtful long pauses supposed to confuse

1452
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:56,255
He doesn't seem angry

1453
01:10:57,535 --> 01:11:02,399
Maybe he's better at controlling that maybe he's just an older person is more life experience

1454
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:08,287
He seems aware of what questions are being asked to him and why they're being asked

1455
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:09,311
For the most part

1456
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:10,591
Yeah this doesn't

1457
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:16,223
Feel like Alex but in this next clip I really saw I saw a

1458
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:18,783
And so that Core group of customers

1459
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:19,807
Some of which

1460
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:21,087
Appreciate the internet and

1461
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:24,159
I'm somewhat you developed before

1462
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:25,183
But but it

1463
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:26,207
Play predated

1464
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:27,743
Social media influencer

1465
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:29,023
You're trying to say

1466
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,839
Before social media became someone

1467
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:36,191
Audience

1468
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:38,495
Which is the product

1469
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:40,031
The product buying audience

1470
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:41,311
It is critical to maintain

1471
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:42,847
Obviously right

1472
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:46,431
When he made that Al Gore joke which is

1473
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:48,479
Something that Alex makes two

1474
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:49,759
It's a bad joke

1475
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:56,159
Yeah I'm laughing he's looking around for sort of validation on his joke told him there is a look on his face

1476
01:11:56,671 --> 01:12:01,023
That is like that I see Alex's face right here

1477
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:06,655
And I'll try and get a screenshot of that and tweeted out but like

1478
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:07,423
To be like

1479
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:11,263
You're coming towards the end of this hour deposition

1480
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:14,591
I get it yeah cic the the

1481
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:15,359
The Alex

1482
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:21,759
Any drones that is an interesting an interesting question you know that

1483
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:22,527
How much

1484
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:29,183
You know I like obviously I've noticed myself doing many of my father's mannerisms overtime sure especially

1485
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:29,951
Age

1486
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:33,535
Couldn't go the other direction is the question I have

1487
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:35,327
Could David Jones

1488
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:38,143
Have spent so much time with his a******* Sun

1489
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:41,215
Now he can't help but be like

1490
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:47,615
Elgin like Al Gore making the internet in my right guys at I'm pretty funny or how much of that Indian Alex is the

1491
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:50,943
The influence of the moral compass of Infowars

1492
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:54,271
31 West Olympia

1493
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:56,831
They talked a bit about

1494
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:59,903
Interaction that he has with Alex

1495
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:03,743
Apparently they only talk business like once a month or something

1496
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:06,559
Define difficult to believe and so did Maddie

1497
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:08,863
But this is just

1498
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,655
I mean

1499
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:17,055
First of the month I put my gold coins into the into the safe and then we begin business meetings new business

1500
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:23,455
Only comes after old business obviously this answer to the question and description here is like

1501
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:25,759
It's okay characterizes everything for me

1502
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:28,575
I want to see about your

1503
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:30,367
Relationship with Alex

1504
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:32,415
Can you describe it

1505
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:34,207
Professional dynamic between the two of you

1506
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:35,743
Mom

1507
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:37,535
Business relationship with Alex

1508
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:39,583
Just highly business-oriented he wants

1509
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:41,887
That he's a big fan of George Washington

1510
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:48,543
And he wants read a biography of George Washington where George Washington hired a friend of his to manage one of his Plantation

1511
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:54,175
Hey wrote the guy letter saying just because you're my friend doesn't mean I'm not going to hold you to a very high standard

1512
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:57,503
I'm going to hold you to a much higher standard than I do anybody else sucks

1513
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:58,271
Expect you to do it

1514
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:02,623
And I would say my range

1515
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:04,415
Professional relationship is rigorous

1516
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:10,047
So you have an anecdote from a founding father

1517
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:12,351
Story that may or may not be

1518
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:14,143
Allele

1519
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:17,215
From a book that Alex allegedly wrote

1520
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:24,639
Yeah but then also the other thing they're of my business relationship is business-oriented

1521
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:31,551
I'd like that that has come to characterize what I feel when I think about David Jones Faz

1522
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,831
Answer non-answer

1523
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:38,719
There's nothing ironically like pulling teeth

1524
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:45,119
It really is just give any specific areas like II

1525
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:47,167
But after that question I'm like okay

1526
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:48,191
Okay David

1527
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:49,471
Great story

1528
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:50,495
What do you do

1529
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:56,127
What do you do what do you do if you are held to a higher standard

1530
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:00,479
How your how do I understand her

1531
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:04,575
What is the basis of that standard what are the standard

1532
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:06,879
Spy with your judge

1533
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:13,279
Thing you did that you were doing things that are inconvenient

1534
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:19,679
I will not expect

1535
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:24,287
I can't speculate about Thursday

1536
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:26,591
Yeah yeah it's annoying

1537
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:32,223
And we're not able to get Doctor Jones

1538
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:38,623
Comeback for other deposition Explorer I think there's a lot of follow-up

1539
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,647
Questions

1540
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:40,415
Maybe wooden

1541
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:41,183
Has been

1542
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:45,791
As in there Mya the lawyers mines in 2019 that's certainly

1543
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:48,863
Later down the road would have been

1544
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:49,631
First thing to

1545
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:51,167
I get to the bottom of butt

1546
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:53,727
Apparently he wasn't

1547
01:15:54,239 --> 01:16:00,383
Responding to the request I think you need bill for this one I think

1548
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,407
Could really cracking

1549
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:04,735
I think David I think there's a point where David wood

1550
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:11,135
He's if you feel coiled spring there's going to be a point

1551
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:14,719
Where is you can get him there and he will explode on you

1552
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:20,607
I don't think it's possible to imagine that there's someone in the Jones family that isn't like

1553
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:22,911
Serta full of Summer Rae

1554
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:29,311
Yeah I'm not saying that I'm not saying he's obviously he's not as easy to get a rise out of as Alex

1555
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:32,639
Try to do anything to get Alaska

1556
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:36,479
Write this it this is a nut that you would have to take some time to crack

1557
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:41,599
Mary is a professional person who is like well I'm not going to

1558
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:42,879
Purposefully

1559
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:47,999
Try and infuriated person beyond all reason that's just wrong

1560
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:54,655
Auto professional interior saying that the key is a gummy worm

1561
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:59,775
I don't know we may never know if possible

1562
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:03,871
So are we come to the end of this exploration of family time

1563
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:06,431
Happy Thanksgiving to us all

1564
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:09,503
Tualatin Heights

1565
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:16,927
I thought this was Illuminating in some ways but also fairly Limited in.

1566
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:18,719
The amount of time that they had

1567
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:20,511
He was very clear that it was

1568
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:21,535
Pretty tight

1569
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:22,815
Because at the end

1570
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:26,143
Norma's is saying I cry think this is about all

1571
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:27,935
The time we're going to give

1572
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:29,727
No it's okay

1573
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:37,407
It couldn't have been as impactful as a lot of the other I like Alex depositions or the corporate reps wear

1574
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:40,991
You're here for 2 days

1575
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:48,927
I still think there's a lot to be to be to be said for this this is one that really for the first

1576
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:49,695
Time

1577
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:50,719
For the first time

1578
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:54,303
I want to dig into what the f*** is going on with this dude brain

1579
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:56,351
You know after this deposition

1580
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:58,143
I I feel like

1581
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:01,215
This is an Avenue where if I can understand

1582
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:02,751
This guy

1583
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:04,031
Then it will be much

1584
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:10,431
Clear all that.

1585
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:16,831
So apparently he won't answer the f****** question

1586
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:21,183
That's where we are

1587
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:24,511
That is true

1588
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:30,655
But at the same time we still get the you know the answer about the spike strip

1589
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:35,519
We're optimization about the confidential and proprietary

1590
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:41,919
Elements of a marketing plan that may or may not exist call Susan Alex's head

1591
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:44,735
Nonsense

1592
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:46,527
Jordan will be back

1593
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:49,343
In theory weather episode soon but until then

01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:55,743

01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:57,791

1596
01:18:58,047 --> 01:19:00,351
Emilio Emilio on dzx Clark

1597
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:01,887
Gosh it

1598
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:08,287
On your way home to go by the library for me

1599
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:11,615
Things that I have checked out too long.

1600
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:15,711
You actually read that you got to read this

1601
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:19,295
The sex robot

1602
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:24,671
Alex
