00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,736
Knowledge party.com

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge babe I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
Need

4
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:11,168
What about Alex Jones

5
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:18,080
My brakes today Jordan as we continue the 2022 serial Adventures

6
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,128
Made aware

7
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,920
That's there's a new captain

8
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:22,944
Crotch

9
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:26,528
Out there all right when I heard about this

10
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,576
You're crazy for this one Captain Crunch

11
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:32,160
What is it you're out there

12
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,720
Caramel Captain Crunch

13
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,488
Yeah it's not go

14
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,024
No how could it be

15
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,304
Dads

16
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:41,888
It tastes bad and also it tears your mouth into shreds right

17
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:46,752
The concept of it is

18
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,032
Time for that

19
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:52,640
Tsar there's just like Cocoa Puffs and then I guess the

20
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:59,040
Captain Crunch pieces are like sort of caramel ish but they're not really bad and I realized as I was eating it if this was more

21
00:01:59,296 --> 00:01:59,808
Karmaloop be worse

22
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,392
Oh yeah yeah yeah I bought it

23
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,416
So

24
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,976
It wasn't good anyway I appreciate the effort

25
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:10,304
It's almost like what they should have done if they were going to do that

26
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:14,400
It's almost like what they should have done is gone with a caramel corn

27
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,424
Kind of

28
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,824
Angela on some of them

29
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,200
You got maybe a little caramel coating on the others like a like a popcorn situation you don't then

30
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:33,088
Yeah and it feels maybe a little more I'll tell Manolo so maybe you have like more of a seasonal family

31
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,880
Yeah it will get suck

32
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
It's not good

33
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,744
I mean why not just make

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,512
Crab

35
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,144
That makes more sense captain crunch's of the Seas

36
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,680
Barnacle flavor

37
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:52,288
Go for it to take weirdos

38
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:56,128
Crab and crunchy water flavored

39
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:00,736
It makes her milk all salty and taste like Brian

40
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:04,320
I like it

41
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:07,136
My bright spot is

42
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,672
I found out

43
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:12,768
Some people texted me that Jordan Peele

44
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,352
Being Jordan Peele Fancher

45
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,912
You know the quality other Jordan

46
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
Right

47
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,216
Sheep

48
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:21,984
You show

49
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,032
Call The Quiet part loud

50
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,336
How far is that

51
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:31,200
It's a horror podcast

52
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:35,296
But it's a joke what's funny to me

53
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,600
Is cuz I didn't even think about that

54
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:41,440
Somebody texting me that and then the other two days ago

55
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,232
The thought occurred to me like oh

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,512
Oh

57
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,304
There had to have been

58
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,352
People who accidentally found my book

59
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,264
Based upon that all the Jordan and the name are the there had to have been so I met

60
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:01,408
He might be higher in search results way higher way higher

61
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,432
What's funny to me of

62
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:06,016
Alright is that I don't I didn't pay for the analects

63
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,808
I'm the Squarespace or whatever

64
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:11,648
But it does show you if there's been a huge bump in traffic or not

65
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,440
The day it was released

66
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:20,095
Huge spike in traffic with a bunch of people whether or not they

67
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:26,495
But it makes me laugh

68
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:32,895
Why do people say what is so funny to me is they looked at me like what the fuc

69
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,663
Is this

70
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,199
Wow this is going to

71
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:39,295
Turn pills going to sue this guy this guy on the ropes

72
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:44,159
Well congratulations on Backstreets traffic

73
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,183
But yes

74
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,743
All over

75
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,559
We do not upset on Friday although we

76
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,583
We did

77
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,887
Mean to we did attempt to

78
00:04:54,399 --> 00:05:00,287
I'm in the situation was that Alex has been waiting for him to re-emerge

79
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,311
Right

80
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:07,711
TD special of some sort but now he was he stayed true to his word of not working

81
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,247
Proud of them

82
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,807
Took another vacation was at the studio all week

83
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,831
And left

84
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,391
Owen Shroyer in charge of the ship

85
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,695
Answer that made things a little bit tough

86
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:22,559
And now we arrive back here on Mondays episode and

87
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,887
Alex has still been out of studio and

88
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,655
I

89
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:31,007
Decided that what we should do is go back and look at a little bit of the stuff that happened

90
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,031
Over the course

91
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,079
Of the beginning of the week

92
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,615
And

93
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,943
See the response to the Club Q shooting

94
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,223
Colorado Springs

95
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,015
I feel like

96
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,295
That is worth

97
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,111
Seeing how they covered it

98
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:49,183
You know it wasn't Alex himself it was Owen Shroyer who is

99
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,231
Leading the charge

100
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,023
In the studio

101
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:59,679
And so yeah that's what we're going to look at here we're going to talk a bit about November 20th and 21st

102
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,727

Thank you you are now it's a crap I listen to 200 episode

00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,623
I'm a policy wonk

00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,391
I have

123
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
Risen above

124
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,607
A little breaking for me

125
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,167
And then we're going

126
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,191
Comeback

127
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:37,983
And I'm going to

128
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,263
Start the show over

129
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,943
I got plenty of words

130
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,223
At the end of the day

131
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,271
F*** you and your new world order

132
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,319
Horse you rode in on

133
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,855
And all your s***

134
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,135
Maybe today

135
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:56,927
Maybe I'll just

136
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,815
And you never see me again

137
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,655
I never wanted

138
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,239
To the crew in the leicestershire

139
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:12,799
Bentley

140
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:24,063
So I'm going to start things off here with just a clip of the beginning of the November 20th

141
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,695
We don't talk a lot about Owen

142
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,583
Find him to be unpalatable to listen to

143
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,119
I think you sucks

144
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,167
Is bad

145
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:39,935
Kind of

146
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,471
A knockoff

147
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:45,823
Alex and he's doing the shotty imitation of this person

148
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:50,175
And he doesn't understand what makes Alex compelling as an orator

149
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,479
Or as somebody who's speaking

150
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,503
Galax

151
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,551
Those things that make Alex

152
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
Fascinating

153
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,647
A chaoticness to Alex

154
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,719
There's a confidence there's an unpredictability

155
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,487
Let make

156
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,767
What do you think things like

157
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,815
Someone brought in Donuts

158
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,583
Stop it

159
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,423
Yeah I appreciate that he's

160
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,215
A chaotic nephrite

161
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,495
Black

162
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,263
Fat

163
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:19,103
I mean at the very least Owen has no idiosyncrasies

164
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:24,479
There is nothing that makes Owen a unique in any kind of Truth

165
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,295
And if there is anything it feels very

166
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,063
Contrived

167
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:34,207
If there's anything that's idiosyncratic about him it feels like this is me signalling to

168
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:40,607
The right-wing troll base or whatever you know there's nothing there's nothing organically Owen

169
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,911
Other than like a man kind of snarky

170
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:46,751
Kind of generic in Alex impression

171
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,567
And so when you begin the show I mean this is really just

172
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,103
And how its impression this far as I

173
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:51,871
Unconcerned

174
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:58,271
Ladies and gentlemen here we are on November 20th

175
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,031
Global Journey

176
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,399
You're not an animal

177
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:06,367
10 things that Alex Goes constantly as he's dramatic

178
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:09,439
Monologues over the intro music and kind of

179
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,767
Are you sad that it's one of the only things that perhaps you could

180
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,559
Unqualifiedly say he's good at

181
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:23,007
He is good at ramping up some kind of an artificial sense of drama in the end now

182
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,311
I think Humanity stands poised

183
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,127
Like there is something that even though you know it's

184
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:28,895
Faking It

185
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:35,551
Domino's meaningless there's still something it's like there's a dramatic tension to that

186
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:41,695
Like there's nothing better than authenticity or whatever once you can fake that you've got it made

187
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,231
You know that kind of idea

188
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,279
And Alex can jump

189
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:51,935
Yeah probably anticipating and Owen is so

190
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,215
Transparently

191
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,751
Just like

192
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:00,895
But again even even in that faking the authenticity he's faking the fake

193
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,175
Version that Alex

194
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,967
Exactly

195
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,735
Just

196
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:05,759
Boring

197
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,087
Alright alright kid

198
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:15,487
Get your own style reminds me of when I'm when I was starting out in Inn, Dayton

199
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:21,887
Canaan Impressions Kyle Kinane there was a Mitch Hedberg

200
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:26,239
They're all those people who were starting out who were just doing impressions

201
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:32,639
There's a lot of people have distinctive deliveries and it's hard not to

202
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:39,807
Be your influences you get caught in that kind of vibe and then if you don't break out

203
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:44,415
You should stop forever you know it's that kind of thing if you don't develop your own voice

204
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:47,999
Quit there isn't there isn't a whole lot going on here

205
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,815
Outside of a Canaan impression metaphorically

206
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:57,471
So on the evening of November 19th through 22 year old named Anderson Aldridge interclub.

207
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:01,055
Q in lgbtq club in Colorado Springs and open fire

208
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:05,663
They killed 25 people and 25 others were injured in the attack

209
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,455
This story is first

210
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,479
Foremost a tragedy

211
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,295
In another sign of the rising tide of anti-lgbt

212
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:17,695
Violence in no small part facilitated and encouraged by modern right-wing media that accuses all members of that community

213
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,999
Good evening pedophiles who are out to groom your child

214
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,839
Alex some Ever Wanted Infowars is complicit in that trend

215
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:27,679
And and the natural endpoint of promoting and normalizing that mentality

216
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:30,495
Is it some people who internalize it and accepted as

217
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,567
May be inspired to take matters into their own hands

218
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,871
Beyond being the tragedy this

219
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,431
Case is also a complete f****** mess

220
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:45,087
The accused shooter Aldrich is the grandson of a right-wing California politician who supported the January

221
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:45,855
6th riot

222
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:50,975
And is the son of a very homophobic former pornstar who went by the name dick Delaware

223
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,815
Who also appeared on an episode of intervention because he was addicted to meth

224
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,887
To complicate matters even further Aldridge

225
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:03,775
Lawyers have claimed that Aldrich is non-binary and wants to be referred to with they them pronouns

226
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,591
Who just caused a lot of varying reactions for people

227
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,151
The prevailing attitude people

228
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:13,759
Seem to have is that this is a ploy to dodge potential hate crime penalties in the case

229
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,319
Since babe never spoken about this prior

230
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:19,135
And they were known to routinely use anti-lgbt

231
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:19,903
Peekyou slurs

232
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,695
People were very shocked

233
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:28,095
To see an interview with their dad where he expressed his surprise hearing his son was involved

234
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,119
A gay bar

235
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,959
Not because five people were murdered but because he was concerned that his son was gay

236
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:39,615
It's really awful to see but in the interview he also says that he hasn't been in aldrich's life for over a decade and

237
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,431
He doesn't come off as a very sober interview subject

238
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,247
Even though he hasn't been in his son's life

239
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,879
He does say that he raised his child to know that being gay is wrong and then fighting is the answer to confer

240
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:57,791
He seems like a s*** influence even though he's very clear that he's talking about hand-to-hand combat and that guns and

241
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,815
Murder are not good

242
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,095
Good distinction

243
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:00,863
Great

244
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:06,239
On top of all this Aldridge's mother called the police after Aldridge made a bomb threat targeted her

245
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,055
But too often the case charges were pressed

246
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,847
And Aldrich was able to keep his gun

247
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:18,015
I do believe that Aldrich could have made that bomb threat but also the mom is not a great source of information

248
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:18,783
Either

249
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,319
From an article in CNN

250
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,087
Quote

251
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:27,487
In 2009 Aldridge's mother received three years of probation for convictions of public intoxication and falsely

252
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,023
Reporting a crime to the police

253
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,559
The false report can Vicks

254
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:36,703
Since a May 2008 incident in Murrieta California in which police responded to a reported home invasion

255
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,055
And found voepel lying on her bed with her hands and legs bound with duct tape

256
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:47,711
Mobiles initially told police a man had put string around her neck boundary with tape and placed a knife on her chest

257
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,015
She admitted the following day however

258
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,575
That she had been under the influence of Narcotics

259
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,367
And fabricated the incident because

260
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:58,207
Quotes she was lonely and wanted attention of police reports

261
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,791
All of this just completely makes me feel ill

262
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:06,911
And at the end of the day I feel terrible for what Aldridge clearly had to live with growing up but that doesn't

263
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,191
Really matter anymore

264
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:12,543
People who have had more difficult challenges of some Advantage not to murder five people with

265
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,567
Clear intentions

266
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,591
To kill many more

267
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,127
I don't want to send

268
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:20,735
All the love and support I can to the survivors and friends and families of those lost

269
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,783
I call her in Colorado Springs

270
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,575
As well as that all of our lgbtq

271
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
YouTube family

272
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,367
Anyway

273
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:32,767
It was somewhat convenient that Alex was out of Studio last week because that meant that we didn't have to talk about his coverage

274
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,047
Of the shooting but I think

275
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,351
It's actually important to loop back and take a look at

276
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,167
My reasoning takes into account a few

277
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,519
The first is that it's relevant to understanding tours angle on this story

278
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:50,175
The second is something that I thought was a little bit more compelling which is that the right-wing media is coverage of this attack has been in.

279
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,735
In a way that I think does field

280
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,503
Different

281
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,527
For lot of folks

282
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,807
Then other times in the past

283
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,343
Princeton

284
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,367
Tim pool took

285
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:01,439
To Twitter to rationalize the shooting is the natural reaction

286
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:04,511
To the idea that cloak you had a quote grooming of that

287
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,327
Which is the way he characterized A Drag Brunch

288
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,351
The club was hosting

289
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:15,263
Get a sickening take that legislation needed to be passed in police needed to stop events like all aged Ragbrai

290
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,287
Crunches

291
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:21,407
But because that wasn't happening it only makes sense that people would try to solve the problem with violence

292
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:25,247
In this clip where he's trying to be like a piece of s*** troll

293
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,039
I noticed that he slipped a little

294
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,599
Now he's just trolling

295
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,647
As a whole with this question that he's

296
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,439
It's not a sincere question

297
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,255
But see if you can notice where he slips up a little bit

298
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,303
A bunch of goddamn pedophiles

299
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,583
Are grooming children

300
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,607
I'm when we're like

301
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,399
Hey stop associating

302
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,703
All lgbtq people with groomers

303
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,983
Y'all keep f***

304
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:46,751
Can do it

305
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:47,775
So you're laughing

306
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,335
If you claim

307
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,639
Drama refers to all

308
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,407
Lgbtq

309
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,943
Then you are calling

310
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,223
All lgbtq

311
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,247
See people groomers

312
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,295
And you are inciting violence

313
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,343
Stop inciting violence

314
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,111
Against

315
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,391
41

316
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:08,511
He knows damn well that right-wing figures use the term groomer as a catch-all for their anti-lgbtq big

317
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:15,167
It's cute game he's playing here but in order to take it seriously you'd have to imagine that Tim is never talk to or listen to any of the

318
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,215
People who come onto his show as gas

319
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:21,055
The slip-up I was talking about is that he says lgbtq p

320
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:27,967
He says that because he hangs out with a community of people who use that term to imply that pedophiles are inherent part of it

321
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,527
A distinct group within the lgbtq community

322
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:35,391
It's a hard slip-up to make too because it requires him to pronounce the P sound

323
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,671
Twice in a row

324
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,695
Which he did

325
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,999
To say lgbtq people

326
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,047
Yep it's a little bit taller

327
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:48,703
Matt Walsh has another figure that is decided to dip his toes into the Waters of justifying mass murder because of his own prejudice

328
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,519
You put a video on YouTube where he said quote

329
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,335
Is it that hard to not cross dress in front of kids

330
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,639
Is the compulsion that overwhelming

331
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,943
If it's causing this much chaos and violence

332
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,247
Why do you insist on continuing to do it

333
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:08,671
The trend among these figures is that they've decided to push the idea that the shooting while probably unfortunate is justice

334
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951
Viable because Drag Brunch

335
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,719
Exist

336
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:14,303
They paint the picture that the Drag Brunch is what's causing the violin

337
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,655
Lgbtq folks would just agree to exist in the constricted boundaries

338
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:21,215
The right-wing extremist speakers in the media demand

339
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,007
Then the violence would stop

340
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,823
This behavior is legitimately

341
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,639
Very difficult for me to distinguish from making failed terrorist

342
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:33,503
It's all bulshit it's not even a sincere pointed someone like Matt Walsh is making

343
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,039
And it all makes me completely sick

344
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:42,207
The types of reactions that we see from these ostensibly more mainstream figures are the sort of things usually normally

345
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,743
Just here in places like Infowars

346
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,511
But now

347
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:50,911
Daily wire pundits and Tucker Carlson are walking all the way up to the Infowars line and debatably Crossing

348
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:57,055
Will be helpful to accurately get a sense of what Infowars coverage consisted of in the after

349
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,919
This episode that we're going to be covering here it starts with November 20th

350
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,199
The day after the shooting

351
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,991
When Owen was filling in for Alex

352
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,319
Who's the Sunday show so it begins at 4 p.m. central

353
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:13,183
There's no reason for them not to be aware of a lot of the primary details by the time Owen gets on there

354
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,791
You look mad

355
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,583
I don't know

356
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:23,423
By their own logic day then it's fine to murder them

357
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:28,031
Like I don't I don't even know how you can say that without recognizing

358
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:32,127
That if you are their self the cause of violence in lgbtq people

359
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:36,991
Can murder you based upon your own dumb f****** argument so I don't give a fuk

360
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:40,319
Alright I understand it's

361
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:43,135
It's important to recognize this into something or argue

362
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,183
I don't I mean I don't care

363
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:48,511
Images trying to not

364
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,559
No we're not I'm sorry

365
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:56,959
I don't mean to cut you off so I'm cutting you off so please continue that's on me that's on me

366
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
Do you think that

367
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:02,591
There is a hope that maybe some of the people in their audience would take this as a sincere argue

368
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:05,151
Argument that they want to commit to

369
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,199
Right because of the

370
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,503
Bad and stupid implications up

371
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:13,087
Just a deflection from taking any kind of stock

372
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:19,232
Of the kind of rhetoric that you are engaged putting out into the world and the consequences videos can have

373
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,792
Right and I say that

374
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,328
And I mean what you know

375
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,888
4 years ago I think I'm on your team

376
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:29,984
And now I don't think that what they say matters

377
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,264
Beyond

378
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,056
If you say it then you said it

379
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:39,712
Via I don't I think I don't care if they are genuine about it or not I don't think it matters

380
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:45,344
Clearly I think clearly the people who want to

381
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:51,744
Say that s*** and then whenever somebody challenges them walking back cuz I wasn't being serious I wasn't being super

382
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,768
I don't give a s***

383
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,304
You said it.

384
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,840
It Is by

385
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,888
Tim pool f****** argument

386
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,680
Farm to murder Tim

387
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,264
Well but that being said

388
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,800
His argument is bad

389
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:11,200
Yes absolutely I'm so it is not a justification to feel super hot to be totally clear

390
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:17,088
I agree with you in the sense that I do think the people if they're saying things and make an argument station

391
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,136
You know you want it now

392
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:23,488
Make that I mean I just don't care if you think your trolling or not that's over

393
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:27,072
For we used to have that trolling thing where you be like

394
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:33,472
Oh they don't mean it I don't f****** care if they mean it anymore their people's were saying that it's almost it's almost

395
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,240
Most irrelevant

396
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:40,128
Or if you mean something as much as the effect that what your have

397
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:48,576
Nope no more no more walking back no more pretending that you were trolling no more nothing you own that forever now

398
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,368
Temple can go f******

399
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,696
Tim pool

400
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:56,000
Fair enough

401
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:59,328
So Oma

402
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,352
The shooting

403
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:04,704
It says not enough first and foremost on his mind but it does have a guest coming

404
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:08,800
30 minutes

405
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,008
Surgery

406
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,760
Owen is not

407
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,296
Covering the shooting

408
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
Per se

409
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,160
But he's leaving the show talking about how he's having Alex Stein on

410
00:23:56,672 --> 00:24:00,512
Because he has a video that he put out where he went and was being a dick

411
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,304
At drag queen story

412
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:07,168
So you can hear in there always engaging in the exact

413
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,704
Start of demonization

414
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:12,800
Campaigns at the right is just

415
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,592
Characterized

416
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,408
Yeah I know I mean at the end of the day

417
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,480
This needs to be a society white acceptance that

418
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,272
The far-right wants to kill gay people

419
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,064
Beyond

420
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,112
Daddy said he wants to

421
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:29,696
That we need to all agree on what to do with themselves

422
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:34,304
I mean again I really don't care

423
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:37,376
I just don't care I'm addicted

424
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,680
To being precise

425
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,448
Fair enough

426
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:44,288
So Owen talks about how they have a rifle

427
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:47,872
Symbol of rifles there there's a people who were protecting

428
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,920
The drag queen story time

429
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,968
It seems like they're not really like

430
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,016
Understand the dynamic

431
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,408
Have a good time

432
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,688
With Alex Stein

433
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:58,016
Yes there are people with

434
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:02,624
Rifles who are protecting a drag queen Story Time and apparently the story

435
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:07,744
Discovering is that there are more gay people who are turning against

436
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:12,352
Drag Brunch is the idea that

437
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:15,424
They would arm themselves

438
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,448
To protect themselves

439
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,496
Has not yet sunk in

440
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,520
To the right wing

441
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,824
They haven't that like the idea is like

442
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,872
So people have guns there

443
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,920
Meaning they're there to print

444
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,688
Text

445
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,760
Against other groomer showing up

446
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,064
As opposed to to protect

447
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,112
Those people inside

448
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,136
From Eufaula

449
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,440
Even if you take

450
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,976
The shooting

451
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,512
In Colorado Springs

452
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,280
Away

453
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,560
From

454
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,584
A2B

455
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,352
Fully

456
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,376
Fair

457
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,424
At the time that we're recording this episode

458
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,008
I don't think we know enough about a full motive

459
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,032
Or anything

460
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,080
Yeah you can make some pretty

461
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,664
Decent assumptions based on available information

462
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,504
But you know there is still a little bit of a leaping to a conclusion

463
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,296
About the precise mode

464
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,088
But even leaving that aside

465
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:07,648
If you don't want to get tangled up in that

466
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,928
You can still save it like

467
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:15,328
Proud boys are showing up and disrupting aggressively drag queen story times in various parts

468
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,096
To the country

469
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,632
A lot of times arm

470
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,912
Yelling about how there's

471
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:25,056
Pedophiles grooming children and hear the idea of armed security in response to that is even

472
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,592
Understandable

473
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,128
You know it even if

474
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,408
There hadn't been

475
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,200
Refusing it would make total sense

476
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,224
100%

477
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,016
But yeah

478
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,320
It's weird it's almost like

479
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:39,136
No just heard a punting on talking about the

480
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:43,744
Do the Elephant Room right now still covering these topics

481
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:47,328
That are adjacent to the subject

482
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,120
Find to be

483
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,216
Not the tip of the spear

484
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:53,984
No

485
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,752
No no

486
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,288
It's I suppose

487
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:02,688
Pretending that the worst thing that you are at fault for didn't happen so you can

488
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,712
Continue to make it

489
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,624
So we got to kill some time here sure why not

490
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,208
Show me Subway

491
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:37,760
I don't necessarily buy shut the fuk up you don't have anything

492
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,912
We don't we don't take cash anymore

493
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,032
Sorry

494
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:37,152
You're not up to date on your phone

495
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:15,552
The paranoid fantasy

496
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:19,392
Kind of getting in the way of enjoying the thing that I am fine with him

497
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:24,512
Inconvenient it is convenient to not take a boat across the Atlantic

498
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:27,840
You know I get it I appreciate it I like to get on the plane

499
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,632
And then you go from one

500
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:34,752
Country to another it's great houses paranoid fantasy what happens

501
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,776
Pterodactyl

502
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,544
Left

503
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:42,944
Right you don't even know which side the pterodactyls are on

504
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,480
Alright see you in the plane

505
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,248
Yeah

506
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:47,040
Where is it easier to Rob

507
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:53,952
Get out of the plane exactly

508
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:57,024
Run an improv show is another problem playing

509
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,328
Exactly they are trying to get you

510
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,984
Like accustomed to Flying because take it out of the plane so they can put on

511
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:13,664
So you'll be acclimated to bad improv shows no matter where you go also to Owens point

512
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,432
I mean I think

513
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:17,248
Babe and someone who's worked in a bar before

514
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,528
It's

515
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,088
Way more convenient to have tabs

516
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,648
It's substantially easier than making

517
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,928
Change for people

518
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:30,560
Especially if it's a busy bar in the second it's dangerous to be a high cash business

519
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:36,960
That you're at the end of the night you have tons of money you have you has the potential

520
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,240
02

521
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,544
Put yourself in a bit more of a dangerous situation

522
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,824
For robberies and such

523
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,872
I think that there's only positive

524
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:44,640
Stu

525
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,968
Bars if they choose to being cash

526
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,248
Non

527
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:52,320
Using bars

528
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,600
To Owens arguing

529
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,136
I say

530
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:59,232
When when when when when will stop whining

531
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,000
You whine

532
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,024
Ray's wine

533
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:04,864
Winding so about 20 minutes into the show

534
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,704
I want finally gets to talking about how there was a shooting

535
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,456
Club

536
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,440
Are you kidding me

537
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:33,536
Oh man

538
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:39,680
So you can see here is Owen begins to bring up the story of the shooting in the space of twenty-four seconds implants

539
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,216
Three separate suggestions

540
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:45,312
To distract the audience from the possibility that this was a mass shooting directed at a community

541
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:49,920
Did his show and his employer Target routinely with ridiculous Lander and

542
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:55,296
First on couches the conversation in terms of discussing the liberal media is a response

543
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,320
So the shooting because

544
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,368
That's more fertile territory for him

545
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,392
He doesn't have the chops

546
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,952
To actually discuss the shooting itself but yelling a bunch

547
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:06,048
Dumb s*** about random tweets he saw is basically the same thing on Infowars

548
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,376
2nd Owen says this is a quote supposed Gabe

549
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:16,800
He knows that if the target of a mass shooting was a gay club there's a high likelihood that a potential motive is homophobia or

550
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,872
Transphobia which are the primary drivers of Infowars contest

551
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,272
In order to create distance in the audiences mind between the possible motive for the shooting and the rhetoric they hear everyday

552
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:28,064
Owen tries to subtly suggest

553
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,600
But it's not actually a gay bar

554
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,392
If I want wanted to do it

555
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:34,720
Tiny bit of research e could have found their website and seeing that instead of

556
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,768
Serving aioli fries they have

557
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,048
Gail Lee fries

558
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:40,096
It's on their menu which is a subtle hint

559
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,120
Very subtle

560
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:47,776
He could have checked out their drink menu and seeing that quote cock shots are on the menu which are described as quote

561
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:51,872
Jello shots dispense through a white or brown cock shaped syringe

562
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:54,176
Check they also have a shot called the c******

563
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,504
Which is fire whiskey and Bailey's alright

564
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,552
I'm not into it

565
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:02,880
The Wayback machine has snapshots of their sight going back to 2000

566
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:06,976
For where they're described his quote at the premiere gay restaurant and Nightclub

567
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:10,560
Their phone number is 571

568
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,328
Gay

569
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,632
I say this with nothing but love and respect

570
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,168
This is not a supposed

571
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:15,936
Gay club

572
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:21,568
It's an Owens interest to muddy the waters though so he throws that into plant seeds of Suspicion in the listener

573
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,104
And actually

574
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,152
If this is more important than it may seem

575
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:31,808
An article about clubque was published in the Colorado Springs Indy in July 2020 with the headline quote

576
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:36,160
Colorado Springs last remaining gay bar Club Q changes with the time

577
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:41,280
That article is a fascinating tale of the queer history of Colorado Springs

578
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:47,680
And how it went from a severely anti-lgbtq environment to the 90s to Tabitha Vibrant Community in a bunch of Gabe

579
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:54,080
Bars to this point in 2020 where there was just this one gay bar left in town because has technology advanced

580
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:57,920
You didn't need to have a specific lgbtq bar for people to meet up

581
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,968
They could use apps and online dating

582
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,272
So many of the other bars became quote

583
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,552
Gay-friendly butt

584
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:09,952
Club Q that the owner Nick greska told the India bout a former bar they worked at quote

585
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:14,560
When people would call us and asked if we were at a bar I was instructed to say

586
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,096
We were a gay-friendly bar

587
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,888
Not explicitly gay bar

588
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,168
But that's not enough

589
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:23,776
Clubque was supposed to be explicitly gay and as greska put it quote

590
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:28,384
The whole idea of this place was to have a safe place to get a permanent one in the city

591
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:32,736
This is the place that only suggesting is maybe not actually a gay bar

592
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,760
Because he's an idiot

593
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:36,576
You just talk s*** and it doesn't know anything about the subjects he covers

594
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:43,488
The third thing he does is it gets all weird about the club being called clubque which he totally isn't saying is I'm going to do with you now

595
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,512
Ron stuff totally not

596
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:50,912
He's doing this because the audience is trying to associate things that are connected to the Q folks to be a globalist

597
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:51,680
Psyop

598
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:57,824
So that was one of yours one of the main defenses that Alex deployed about why January 6th wasn't actually the Patriots fault

599
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:03,968
I didn't call the shooting of false flag however if it's clubque I think you can put it

600
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:06,528
Together doing this to wink at the audio

601
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,832
Maybe they should think that it's a global Asylum

602
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:15,488
Again the club was named clubque I sent at least 2004 so unless qanon has been going on since their Joy

603
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,280
George W Bush Administration

604
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,328
And therefore it actually predates the Tea Party

605
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,656
If I had to guess

606
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,704
Because I can't really nail this down exactly

607
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:31,104
I would say that maybe the club was named after clubque the long-running dance party for queer women in San Francisco

608
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:37,504
The beginning like the mid-80s yeah that's just a guess but it's also worth noting that a lot of clear oriented things use the letter q

609
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,040
Yeah

610
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:44,160
Anyway as you can tell right out of the gate Owen is invested in throwing out distractions

611
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:48,512
To get away from the heart of the issue and I think that it's pretty f****** obvious why

612
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:53,376
And this is this is one of the reasons that I I find that argument about

613
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:59,008
The shooter's Identity or or whatever about it

614
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,312
In regards to the heinousness of

615
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,592
The crime being a hate crime

616
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,896
If you are attacking

617
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,176
A place that the

618
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,456
Illicitly safe

619
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,480
Forgave

620
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:11,552
People then it is by nature a n

621
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,344
Whitley homophobic crime

622
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,648
Regardless of motive or in

623
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,184
Tent broke because

624
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,024
I don't give a f*** what his brain but their brain

625
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,048
Suggest

626
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:24,096
Is the motive behind their attack

627
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,632
The attack itself

628
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,656
Is the motive

629
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:30,496
I agree I agree with you I do still think that there are important

630
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:34,592
Things to terms of the broader conversation those things are important

631
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:39,200
Particularly in terms of the way that this shooting

632
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,992
Connect to

633
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:44,320
The rhetoric that's being that that's deployed by

634
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:46,368
Checkers in the right-wing media

635
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,392
I think

636
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:51,232
That is where that intersection is important the motive in

637
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:55,072
I agree with you that the effect

638
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,864
Of it is is

639
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,168
It's an attack on the safety of all

640
00:37:59,424 --> 00:37:59,936
Gay people

641
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:02,240
Simultaneous I don't disagree with that

642
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:08,640
Yeah I know I just don't I just wanted to make sure that I was given to the idea that the motive is not unimportant

643
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:14,528
What you're saying is that regards it is entirely possible I believe it's entirely

644
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:18,624
A possible for this person to have not listened to a single word that Tucker Carlson

645
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,744
Or Alex Jones have said it's entirely possible that this is unrelated

646
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,536
To the larger

647
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,072
Global rhetoric

648
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:30,912
Around the circumstances could be very personal but the attack itself

649
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,448
Tells you what the motive is

650
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,240
It's an attack on a safe space

651
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,032
Yeah and it's me it seems

652
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,568
Unlikely

653
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,616
From a lot of surrounding contacts

654
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,384
Text that

655
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,200
That Daddy doesn't

656
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,224
Exist with

657
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,760
In the larger context

658
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:46,784
Right of

659
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,368
Of so much of this right-wing media weather be on social media or

660
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,184
You know these people's actual shows

661
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:54,720
But

662
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:55,744
But

663
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,816
The extent that there is a Clear Connection

664
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:03,168
That is something that is a little bit March

665
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,448
That I can respect

666
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,496
So Owen

667
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,800
Plays a little bit more of a sort of

668
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,080
A deflection game

669
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:08,192
I'm not sure this argument is as good as Owen thinks it is

670
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:14,592
He's saying that his rebuttal to people calling for gun reform based on the mass shooting is to point out that there are even more shootings

671
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:20,480
Isn't it just saying that the problem is worse than the gun-grabbers or say this is dumb

672
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,016
Hopefully this is a dishonest ARG

673
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:26,112
Owen isn't arguing for anything political or even productive

674
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,952
At the core he's saying that people shouldn't care about the Club Q shooting

675
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,744
That's the point of this present

676
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:38,400
He's pushing back against people caring about a mass shooting at a gay bar where five people were killed and many more would have been

677
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:40,704
The shooter had been beaten up by Brave bar

678
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:46,848
Obviously other shootings are tragic as well and they are all indicative of problems that we need to address

679
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,688
The issue comes down to these not being analogous situation

680
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,992
And because of that the game Owen thinks he

681
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,528
He's playing is actually meaningless

682
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,320
He doesn't

683
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,856
We care about those other shootings

684
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,416
No I mean I I don't

685
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:04,768
Like it is it is something where

686
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:07,072
Even if this person

687
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:07,840
Owen

688
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,680
At one point had some sort of ability to

689
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,448
Connect

690
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,240
Empathetically to a story

691
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,544
By virtue of this

692
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,616
As your job as like your imperative

693
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:22,944
And as as the social group that he surrounds himself with

694
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,736
Old murders

695
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,016
Are are nothing

696
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,040
You know like

697
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:33,696
I8 how can you not be affected blows my mind you kind of have to take on a bit of solipsism

698
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:40,352
Absolutely like nothing I can really be real for you

699
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:44,192
Southern shootings and it's like I don't even have time to express like

700
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,216
Bat box

701
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,752
3 up man man

702
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:52,128
Don't think you said one that f**** me I've been there was another that f**** me up and then you said another

703
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:55,455
That's f***** up it's bad yeah

704
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,223
I don't

705
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:56,991
Know if

706
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:02,879
Separate incidents like the one that talked about in Baltimore is 2 people were injured

707
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,671
Yeah that's bad

708
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:06,463
I mean I'm not sure

709
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:09,023
If that is the same

710
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:15,423
As a mass shooting at a club I mean we live in Chicago and we can talk about the gun violence in Chicago

711
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,447
Toggle all we want

712
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,983
But what Owen is talk

713
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,263
About his gun violence

714
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:21,823
Genocide and trying to

715
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,103
Acts like that Izzy

716
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,383
Equivalent to

717
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,175
Gun violence

718
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:29,503
Then there's essentially domestic

719
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:30,783
Yeah

720
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,575
There's a little bit of a

721
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,135
So

722
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,439
What would this show be

723
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,975
If there wasn't a little bit of sexy

724
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,799
Donald Trump

725
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,111
Harass

726
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:11,231
That's funny because Alex Stein

727
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:14,559
Rose to prominence cuz he sexually harassed AOC

728
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:17,119
Man I decide it's funny

729
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:20,703
You know he's calling her at her

730
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:24,799
Pretty ladies so too bad too bad she sucks

731
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:28,383
I needed it is fun that I

732
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,431
Do you know their cowardice

733
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:32,479
Is so distinct

734
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,503
And clear

735
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:37,855
Whenever they specifically go after AOC because it's

736
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,903
It's a combined like

737
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:45,023
One she would never deign to give a f*** about our response so we can

738
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:49,375
And say whatever we want with no repercussions and let Soros level of life

739
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:55,263
Well that's not actually true she might dunk on some of these fools on Twitter

740
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:58,591
Down to the point where she's going to sue them

741
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:01,663
Something and then it'd be over

742
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,455
Over whatever it is in people

743
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,991
Argue in the comments

744
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:05,759
For forever

745
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:11,135
Only it only serves to elevate and get you more attention if she does

746
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:14,975
Exactly and then the fact that obviously

747
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:17,535
The angle that they're going to take is a

748
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,815
Paternalistic massage

749
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:21,119
Without question and it's like

750
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,423
I mean if it's so annoying

751
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,447
You fuc

752
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,215
Nowhere

753
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:28,543
If you want to f****** come

754
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,591
Trolling motueka outfits

755
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,615
It's

756
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,151
Dumb anyway

757
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,711
Alex Stein comes on

758
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,991
And they play

759
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:40,319
A clip of him at that drag queen story time

760
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,855
I just think that this is

761
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:47,999
First of all ridiculous and like this is the day after that shooting I don't know why they didn't

762
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,023
Let's go ahead

763
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:49,791
Put this off

764
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,071
Yeah

765
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:54,399
Alex Stein is available anytime

766
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,935
Do this tomorrow or

767
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:56,703
Next week

768
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:31,775
Cinnamon to put into your time

769
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:35,871
Attempted murder's below the waist

770
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:36,639
God bless

771
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,503
Convoluted

772
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:47,903
People have a political ideology that says that they should support on Susan's Braxton the Second Amendment

773
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:54,559
You really disagree with the concept of drag queen story time it should be antithetical to their gun absolutism to mock people for

774
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:55,583
Carrying in public

775
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:59,423
And this is why it's important to understand that they don't actually really care about gun

776
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:03,519
I mean I mean I care about guns and they want them but they want what they represent

777
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,287
More

778
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:10,687
They want the ability to impose mortal fear in political enemies and couch it in a philosophical love for the Constitution

779
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:17,599
For instance they want folks to their team to be armed to the teeth when they go to protest at a reproductive Health Point

780
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:20,927
So the people seeking care or the clinic staff are terrified

781
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:27,583
Courser protests in the wake of the killing of George Floyd they want people on their side to be armed and wandering around acting is Vigil

782
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,119
That is good

783
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:34,239
Conversely they don't want principal gun owners to protect the targets of their attacks

784
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:40,895
They mock carrying guns here when the people are outside of drag queen story time or if armed citizens were to post up at

785
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,663
Abortion clinic

786
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,735
They don't want guns in these contexts because

787
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:50,111
What those guns represent which is that vulnerable communities may not be as vulnerable as you want them

788
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:54,463
He's incredibly distasteful for them to be playing this the day after the shooting

789
00:46:54,975 --> 00:47:01,119
How excited is just mocking the idea of armed citizens protecting the drag queen story time which is the exact type of event that people like

790
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:04,447
Tim pool and Matt Walsh would go on to use as a justification

791
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:06,751
Why the shooting maybe wasn't so bad

792
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:09,055
Also sinuses really bad at this

793
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:12,639
He strikes me as the kid in like I School play who's overact

794
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:19,295
He's Hamming it up a little bit too much because he knows that no one would pay attention to him if you reeled it in I was subtle

795
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:24,415
I have a subtle mode and no sucks

796
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,439
He doesn't understand

797
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,975
And because he's f******

798
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,255
King stupid along with the rest of

799
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,535
Is that what he's

800
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,559
He's essentially saying

801
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,327
Is that

802
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,911
All of the horrible f****** murders were committed by us

803
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,447
Because

804
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:39,519
If you are insistently belittling the

805
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:42,335
Concept of your ideological opponent

806
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:46,687
Having guns and in fact having all of them be squirt guns

807
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,735
Then you are actually insisting that

808
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:55,135
The only people who murder people are the f****** conservatives you f****** moron

809
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:57,183
Exactly you f****** idiot

810
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,999
Now there is also a subtle

811
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,047
Maybe

812
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:04,095
I don't know I don't know if this is a conscious

813
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:07,679
Motivation necessarily or if it's just sort of like

814
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:10,239
Something that's a part of this and that is that

815
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,775
There is an egg goal

816
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,567
Of kind of mocking

817
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,847
These folks

818
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:15,871
So they won't

819
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:18,687
Show back up there won't be people

820
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:22,015
Standing there right and giving a message that like

821
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,807
This is not a soft target

822
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:27,903
There is a desire for these people who are standing guard and such

823
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:28,927
To go away

824
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:32,255
And I think they do and is pretty aware this as

825
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:34,047
He explains how he

826
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:35,583
Antifa out of Austin

827
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:07,327
You were afraid to do a deposition

828
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:33,951
Rip Austin antifa

829
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:39,583
That is one of the most deluded

830
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:45,983
Things I think I've ever heard I'd like to remind everyone of the time that I got dunked On by a child

831
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:52,383
I don't think anybody is that interested

832
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:54,175
Mocking them into submission

833
00:49:54,431 --> 00:50:00,575
Infowars had to hire an outside lawyer to be there f****** corporate representative because we

834
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,367
He made fun of them to be right

835
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:05,183
We made fun of you too bad

836
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:10,303
And now you're going to act like you have f****** s*** get out of here

837
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:16,703
Into submission

838
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:19,263
Dum Dums in Chicago

839
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,127
Amazing

840
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:25,151
So

841
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,943
I agree weary of

842
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:32,319
Hearing Alex Stein's voice reasonable and so I decided to let's go on

843
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,855
Check out other

844
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:34,623
Episode

845
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:37,951
See where we're at and sewed the American Journal

846
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:39,487
The next day

847
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,767
Harrison wasn't host

848
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:43,327
Arizona Christy Lee who is hosting

849
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,095
I believe

850
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,119
And I

851
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:47,935
Didn't care

852
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:51,519
Can we bring another character into this

853
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:55,359
If it's a fill-in host hosting and is not like

854
00:50:55,871 --> 00:51:02,015
One of their actual Varsity players that I don't have anything to grab onto we could get rid of doctor number for

855
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,295
All soap operas

856
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,319
And no one would notice

857
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:06,879
Well that's it for the doctor number for

858
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,671
I mean what about house

859
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:15,071
Oh well I mean I'm talking about

860
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:18,143
Doctor number for in the script you know what I'm saying

861
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:24,287
This is Kristi Lee is Doctor number for in the script and we can cut her out

862
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:26,079
She's got two lines of dialogue

863
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:26,847
Max

864
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:29,407
Well actually I am my own argument falls apart

865
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,943
Because

866
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:33,247
The later seasons of House

867
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:37,087
He ended up having to pick Survivor style competition

868
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:43,487
Got a bunch of.

869
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:45,023
Doctor Who

870
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:48,095
So maybe maybe there's

871
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:51,423
11 actor on the show and the writers like hey

872
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:57,823
We've got a whole thing where were eliminating a bunch of people I'm like s*** I hope I don't find out that they didn't need me

873
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:04,223
Cowpens was one of the doctors I meant his character committed suicide because he went to work for like the Obama

874
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:07,807
Realized

875
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:10,111
Character office

876
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:12,927
Bummer

877
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:18,559
We go to the 21st on the Infowars Alex Jones Flagship show

878
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:20,607
And is hosting again

879
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,423
We Begin the show

880
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:27,775
With Alex on the phone Alex is hosting on the phone

881
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:18,975
So he's taking care of the big issues here on this Monday episode Alex's come in specifically on his way

882
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:21,791
Vacation on the phone to complain about Elon Musk

883
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:25,375
You know what is a fan of History

884
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:29,471
Particularly you know I used to do the bit about ants

885
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,751
Andrew Jackson and dualculture

886
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,543
Sure know that kind of

887
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:33,567
And in

888
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:37,407
Thinking about that you know it always kept it within the point-of-view of the p

889
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,687
People within the duel

890
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:40,735
And their Social Circle and how they react

891
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:42,783
What I

892
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:43,807
What I forgot

893
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:47,391
At least what I overlooked I'm just now realizing is what

894
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,415
Must have been like

895
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:50,719
For just a regular poor person

896
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:53,023
To suddenly read in the paper you know like

897
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:55,583
F****** Alexander Hamilton dead

898
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,863
You know and be like

899
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,143
Alright man

900
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:04,799
What is Elon Musk and Alex Jones had a duel it didn't occur to me that we would all get to be like a

901
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,591
He wants dead nice

902
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,359
How about that

903
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:11,967
What one of them would be dead dispute

904
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:18,367
Exactly like how weird would that have been you know in a political Arena

905
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:20,927
That would be very weird and I think

906
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:23,743
Bad sister

907
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:24,511
Let's look at this

908
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:25,791
Boom threat

909
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:29,375
He just sent it to exact a letter H back on Twitter

910
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:33,471
Amen he quoted a Bible verse

911
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:38,079
Elon Musk is saying that he's going to put a millstone around

912
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:42,175
Well Alex Beasley Bible is the fundamental inviolate book that is a threat

913
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:46,271
Dakota scripture at me it is at 5

914
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:48,319
Scripture boating hat

915
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,135
Alex

916
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,415
Ariana chair

917
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,383
Yeah that makes sense

918
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,175
Yep

919
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,711
No arguments for me

920
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:51,039
The boj is involved in his tweet

921
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:53,855
Elon Musk

922
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:57,951
Doj is Riker tweets for Elon Musk

923
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:01,279
They are not busy

924
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,047
Nope

925
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:34,047
Nice

926
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:39,423
It's the it's the Infowars snap funded that's where you at that's where you know where we're at

927
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:42,239
Yeah good ad reads he's too good at a trade

928
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,263
The fuk up now

929
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:45,311
It's also man

930
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:46,335
Like

931
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:47,615
But with what's

932
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:54,015
You're on vacation you're calling in to complain about Elon Musk and try and sell your shirt

933
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:56,831
Vacation he still needs money and he still reads Twitter

934
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,135
Where else is he going to b**** about it

935
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:01,695
It's pretty remarkable though that like

936
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:02,975
I mean

937
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:06,559
Yeah the shooting was big news for talking about it

938
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:08,095
Alex is going to come in

939
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:17,311
Got a weird that he's starting off just being petty about Elon Musk reading do you know I mean

940
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,359
In his world though

941
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:20,895
It is it is like

942
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,687
Look at the world we live in now

943
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,967
And

944
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:26,015
This is a f*****-up event

945
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:29,855
And unfortunately the new cycle is going to

946
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:31,135
Move on

947
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,159
End

948
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:35,999
As much as we make fun of Alex for being a f******

949
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:38,303
Non serialized show

950
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:42,655
Unfortunately all too often we live in a non serialized show

951
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,679
In this regard

952
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:46,751
And so I can see why he'd be like a f*** it I better

953
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,287
I can get away with not talking about

954
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,823
Is that all

955
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:54,943
I got Tim pool and Tucker Carlson and all these motherfukers out here that is

956
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:56,991
The case then essentially

957
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,783
What is this reveals

958
00:57:59,039 --> 00:57:59,551
Is

959
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:02,879
Elon Musk tweet

960
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:03,903
Would also

961
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:09,279
Then I'll move out of the editorial choice

962
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:11,839
Pay attention just to things that are

963
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:13,887
Weirdly self-aggrandizing

964
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:19,775
As you said earlier might be a part of the gig

965
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:23,103
So Alex continues to complain

966
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:23,871
About Elon

967
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:24,639
Tweeting about it

968
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:58,943
I don't think I most people in the last forever that thrilled with what he lawn was up to with Twitter

969
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:01,759
I don't know what kind of charade Alex is trying to pull here

970
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:05,855
The entire first segment of the show is Alex Shilling his supplements in book

971
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,135
Desperately begging for money

972
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:09,951
And now the second segment is clearly just Alex

973
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:11,231
Complaining about a lawn mower

974
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:14,303
This is an important Dynamic to understand perfume

975
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,351
The first is that Alex

976
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:21,983
Really can't disappear for too long because no one else moves product at nearly the rate he does

977
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,775
If he wants to take time off

978
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:30,175
He does kind of need to pop in and do s*** like this to reassure the audience that he's still there and remind them that they need to give my

979
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:30,943
Money to the cult leader

980
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:36,063
These people will not tithe 40n or Harrison but Alex can coax that out of

981
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:42,719
You got it the second is that from a Content perspective the Club Q shooting is not relevant enough for Alex to address on the show

982
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:45,791
A while he's on vacation

983
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:49,375
However what's super important to talk about is that Elon Musk

984
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,655
Mentioned him on

985
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:52,703
He doesn't covered news

986
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:55,263
Not he's not competent talk show host

987
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:57,055
But he's amazing at wrangling attend

988
00:59:57,823 --> 01:00:03,711
He's done it since the VHS and bullhorn days and now the technology and social media has evolved this is that equivalent

989
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:09,343
With you on saying that Alex isn't going to be let back on Twitter Alex knows that he has an opportunity to get

990
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:14,207
Some attention but it requires a responding to keep the image of a fight alive and

991
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:15,487
The window is short

992
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:17,023
He needs to

993
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:18,815
You know get in there

994
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:19,583
Now

995
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:24,447
Because him responding when he gets back from vacation don't give a s***

996
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:27,775
Self-aggrandizing drama is what Alex is most interested in

997
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:34,175
And Alex probably should have known that deal on felt this way about him if all the other stories that he tells her true at all

998
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:38,015
Alex is very strongly implied that he's gone to dinner with Musk

999
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:39,295
Because of the Rogan connect

1000
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:43,903
How to talk about how Joe is told them that Elon loves him and all this but

1001
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:48,255
Now that musket come out publicly said that Alex has a piece of s*** and is never coming back on Twitter

1002
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:50,303
I guess all that other stuff didn't happen and

1003
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:54,655
How to explain why you made it all up just to Dazzle the listeners

1004
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:59,263
The great yeah yeah it is it is funny to me now like

1005
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:01,823
How open

1006
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,615
So many Corporation

1007
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:05,663
Then share about paying my Atlas

1008
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:09,503
We're going to support these politicians I mean we still need our tax

1009
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:14,111
Texas low they want to kill gay people

1010
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:16,415
It Isn't So

1011
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:19,743
People like Alex are all complaining about the left

1012
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:21,535
Just coming to Kelly's like man

1013
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:27,935
The left is nowhere near this s*** the left is nowhere near owning Twitter selectors nowhere near owning Coco

1014
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:33,311
Cola in or whatever it is you want In fairness of woke ideology that runs Coca-Cola

1015
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,079
And

1016
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:40,479
The left of own Twitter right that's the problem with Twitter

1017
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:41,759
Too much left is Conte

1018
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:47,647
So Alex complexity of course

1019
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:37,055
Are you just think this is

1020
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:41,151
Sad yeah he's almost 50 I know

1021
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:43,455
This is an adult being like

1022
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:48,575
Elon Musk does not play by the rules of his Twitter poll I mean

1023
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:50,623
Kyra mean

1024
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:57,023
We'll put these tweets on screen is about the worst sentence end up in the English language second only to the

1025
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:58,303
There's a lot of big news

1026
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:01,887
Someone made a meme

1027
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:03,679
Repertoire

1028
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:04,703
Is it strong

1029
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:06,239
Oh my God

1030
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:12,639
I don't like the way this guy who all bought a toy using imaginary money

1031
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:16,735
It's going to be mean to me this is

1032
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:18,527
Very sad very very sad

1033
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:19,807
Yep anyway

1034
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:21,343
Alex understands

1035
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,367
Elon splasher

1036
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:43,871
Is it

1037
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,151
What

1038
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:44,799
This is this is a six-week hit the panic button put on his big boy pants

1039
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:46,079
Are peas the left

1040
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:46,847
But then

1041
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:49,407
Compared himself to Jesus Christ too far

1042
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:52,223
That's too far also I would say that if there are moles in

1043
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:55,551
Involved I know of one person that you need to call

1044
01:04:55,807 --> 01:05:01,951
How to take care of this and that is Anderson Cooper

1045
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:02,975
Back mole quotes

1046
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:06,047
And then I forgot that Anderson Cooper was the

1047
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:09,887
Mark L Walberg

1048
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:11,935
Goldberg

1049
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:14,239
That's the right boy

1050
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:17,567
So this is pathetic but I got to say I admire Alex's swing here

1051
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:22,943
If there's one thing that Elon Musk certainly doesn't seem to care much about it all it's a piece

1052
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:23,967
But

1053
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:24,735
This is great

1054
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:29,087
Now it's can keep all the Rogan backstory and still be mad at MUSC

1055
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:31,391
About him not getting that back on Twitter

1056
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:35,487
He just has to pretend that he's actually mad about his must compare himself to Jesus

1057
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:38,303
Alex does about himself

1058
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,583
All the f****** time

1059
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:46,239
Almost dead was quoted Bible verse which if you compare that with Alex's grandiose stories about how God selected him to fly

1060
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:47,263
Like the literal devil

1061
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,823
Really seem like that big of a deal

1062
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,639
But Alex needs an excuse to be mad but isn't

1063
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:53,663
Just pettiness

1064
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:58,527
And religious bulshit pops the audience so this is a good play honestly I think he nailed it

1065
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:00,831
How you needed the thread that needle

1066
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:01,855
Yeah used

1067
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:02,879
Pulling out a rap

1068
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:05,183
That's what he's going for here because

1069
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:12,351
Sneaky Snake

1070
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:17,471
Beef with Elon musk's cuz if he keeps coming then it's great

1071
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:20,543
One of Alex's great

1072
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:21,567
Trick Susan's

1073
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,615
Trying to

1074
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:29,759
Get people caught up in fights with him that serve to elevate his own position Elon Musk

1075
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:30,527
Pig

1076
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:31,551
Great

1077
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:38,207
So what would this show be without a little bit of veiled anti-semitism

1078
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:41,023
Did not know that

1079
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:59,967
You said they were good

1080
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:05,759
Big story

1081
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:12,159
Superhero Alex wears his position at the NBA with his opposition to NFL players taking a knee as a silent protest

1082
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:13,183
Police brutality

1083
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:14,463
I don't think

1084
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:20,863
This is also just a talking point from 2019 that I was just pulling out of his ass to defend himself because he really doesn't have an actual tooth

1085
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:22,399
Transfer his actions other than to

1086
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,423
Play Olympus track

1087
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:29,823
Albert borla is ahead of Pfizer and on November 10th he was given the adl's courage against hate

1088
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:32,127
Also would have passed recipient of that

1089
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:35,199
Clumpy will Kaya have a Chobani grapes

1090
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:39,295
The reason we got this award had to do with well I'll just quote his acceptance

1091
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,063
Future

1092
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:46,463
Somatic messages on message boards and on Flyers posted in communities across the country suggesting that the

1093
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:51,071
Coronavirus was a tool for Jews to spam expand the global influence

1094
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:52,607
The Jews were profiting

1095
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:54,911
From covid-19 Jews were the real virus

1096
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:58,239
Heat Peddlers referred to the Jew vaccine

1097
01:08:58,495 --> 01:08:59,775
To dissuade others from receiving

1098
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:02,847
So messages even refer to my own Jewish heritage

1099
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:04,127
Do use it as evidence

1100
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:05,663
That the widespread vaccine effort

1101
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:08,479
It was part of a calculated long-term Jewish plot

1102
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:10,783
To Institute a global Jew government

1103
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:13,343
It makes sense why borla got this award

1104
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:19,487
Given the context of everything and wow it's fair to agree or disagree with some of the points that he makes in his speech

1105
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:21,535
He didn't say any of those things Alex's claim

1106
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:26,911
How it's probably only knows about this beach and his award at all because of this line

1107
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:30,239
Quote now they're bright spots amid this Darkness

1108
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:33,823
Just last month a jury awarded close to a billion dollars

1109
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:40,223
The families of those who lost loved ones to the Sandy Hook massacre because of one man with a microphone spoke disgusting and disgrace

1110
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:40,991
Hazel eyes

1111
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:46,111
The jury flat-out rejected his lies and made an unambiguous statement that such evil is not acceptable

1112
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:49,695
That got an Applause from the audience

1113
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:53,023
And Alex is probably just a little pissed off that he didn't actually get a name check

1114
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:53,791
Yeah

1115
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:55,327
Yeah that's pretty funny

1116
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:56,095
Say my name

1117
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:57,887
That's pretty funny

1118
01:09:58,143 --> 01:10:00,191
Yes I think that's the only reason Alex even knows by

1119
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:01,983
Mother lost a billion dollars and you don't even

1120
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:09,919
This entire segment is essentially Alex claiming that too he didn't do any of the things that people say about

1121
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:11,967
Sandy Hook

1122
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:14,783
Anybody lawn Moss chair and then of course

1123
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,935
Even more ads

1124
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,727
Biggest alley-oop

1125
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:35,519
Biggest sale reader pudding

1126
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:41,663
Gifts in with the orders that you make me out to be it's a bumper sticker

1127
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:44,735
It's randomly generated by the robot

1128
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,527
In his Warehouse

1129
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:48,575
They're going to put little things who knows

1130
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:49,855
Could be anything that you get

1131
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:50,879
Like a Cracker Jack

1132
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:56,511
Yeah just as useless as surprises

1133
01:10:56,767 --> 01:11:00,351
That's a big sale also double Patriot points

1134
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:06,239
Ann and I will say that use code 1776 checking if his surprise

1135
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:07,263
Was

1136
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:09,823
Is one of the Batman Forever McDonald's mugs

1137
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:10,591
From the past

1138
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:11,871
I might get something

1139
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:12,895
I really might

1140
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:15,967
If he was throwing in old Batman Forever mugs

1141
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:16,991
Those things were

1142
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:20,063
Unbreakable Deborah why would open up my order from

1143
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,855
Infowars

1144
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:29,023
Great song and off after his

1145
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,327
But then it comes back from commercial

1146
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:39,423
Think about it

1147
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:45,311
You're almost

1148
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,079
50

1149
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:52,479
There's been so much whining and now you're going to end it with I don't even want to go back

1150
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:56,831
I don't even want it I don't even want it what it is is the principle of

1151
01:12:57,855 --> 01:13:02,719
It's not even he's not even saying that it now play with this

1152
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,999
Cracker Jack box

1153
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:09,631
Oh my God I do think this was worth him coming back after he'd already signed off so that is

1154
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,167
It makes sense

1155
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:14,495
Well you wanted a hit on it and he didn't hit on it earlier he did

1156
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:16,287
To thank everybody

1157
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:17,823
He didn't hit on that

1158
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:19,615
But what is a God

1159
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:21,407
Was that he doesn't actually

1160
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:26,015
Care

1161
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:32,415
Grace came back anyways Elon Musk

1162
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:37,023
Came back and he was like I'm not to touch on this earlier I didn't bring it up there was the shooting

1163
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:44,703
Once does it get mentioned

1164
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:46,495
Completely bizarre

1165
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:48,543
Samoan takes over and immediately

1166
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:49,823
Brings up

1167
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:38,975
What

1168
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:51,007
This is essentially a threat

1169
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:57,407
In Patriot militia type communities and ideology it's well understood that when disarmament happens it's time that

1170
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:58,431
Do you got to start killing

1171
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:02,015
I brought it up in the past but this is idea is essential to

1172
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:03,807
To the book unintended consequences

1173
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:09,183
Also in the Turner Diaries the inciting incident that leads to the Insurrection is the Cowan

1174
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:10,975
Government confiscation of Fire

1175
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:15,583
Owen is reached the point of covering the story where he's just making veiled threats

1176
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:18,655
If you take this mass shooting this bad consider that if

1177
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:25,055
Regulation all my friends will start killing cops and engaging in a full-scale insurrection

1178
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:28,127
Becoming the American Al-Qaeda that they've always wanted to be

1179
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:34,527
So if you compare it to the killing that we would do human tasks on regulation this shooting really isn't that big a deal

1180
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:36,575
Think about it that way and stop complaining

1181
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:38,879
Basically which sucks

1182
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:43,487
Yeah and it only works so long as

1183
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:44,255
It's a threat

1184
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:45,279
You know

1185
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:48,351
It only means something so long as it's a threat

1186
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:51,679
Because obviously if they were to actually try that s***

1187
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:54,239
It's not going to dare not going to

1188
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:55,775
Overthrow the f******

1189
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:58,079
They're going to be Criminal

1190
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:03,199
I wish I would have thought similar things maybe

1191
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:04,991
2 years ago that's fair

1192
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:09,087
That's fair I mean even the morning of January 6th I thought

1193
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,879
There's no way this is

1194
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:14,207
There's no way they're going to get inside the

1195
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:17,535
Yeah yeah but I thought that was nice

1196
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:27,007
That's that's a lot of surprises I do a lot of expectations

1197
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:30,079
That we may have might might be faulty

1198
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:33,151
That is fair but that said I think that

1199
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:36,991
Overthrowing the government sure maybe lofty but

1200
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:39,551
The idea of creating

1201
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:41,599
Sal's of

1202
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:45,183
It's actually far more engaged and active domestic Terror

1203
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:46,207
I don't think

1204
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:47,487
Gay is unrealistic

1205
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:48,767
Stick for what they are

1206
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:52,607
I'm going to throw this out at you and it's going to be an unpopular thought

1207
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:53,631
To that

1208
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:56,703
They're all lazy and cowardly

1209
01:16:57,983 --> 01:17:02,079
Well I think that you might Comfort yourself in

1210
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:03,871
Constantly viewing

1211
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:06,431
The lazy and cowardly want

1212
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:10,271
I think that behind that are number of people who

1213
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:11,807
You may not have ever heard of

1214
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:13,855
You aren't media figures

1215
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:15,135
Who are less

1216
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:15,903
Stop

1217
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,951
Barbie that's something you should be worried

1218
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:18,975
That's fair

1219
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:20,511
Anyway

1220
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:21,535
CBS News

1221
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:22,815
Did a piece

1222
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:24,095
But Owens

1223
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:26,399
Excited and condescending about

1224
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:51,743
The Grinch

1225
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:56,351
Minions

1226
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:24,767
You're being away

1227
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:42,687
Was that making fun of them

1228
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:23,391
You have to prove that

1229
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:34,399
Nope I was way wrong

1230
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:46,431
Because then guess what

1231
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:47,711
Guess what guess what

1232
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:48,479
Hillary

1233
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:49,503
Hillary

1234
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:51,295
I bring Hillary back

1235
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:52,575
I just can't

1236
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:58,975
Just too insane just too insane stop it I thought was going to be assassinated before the midterms

1237
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:02,047
Are we supposed to be

1238
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:04,095
Thought we were hit by a nuke

1239
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:08,959
CBS News did a story about hunter's laptop because

1240
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:14,080
And the timing of this is because they were able to acquire a copy of the data directly from the source

1241
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:17,152
Not a second or third-hand thing

1242
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:23,552
The data with friends a computer Specialist or two who said that they didn't believe that they saw us

1243
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:27,392
Signs of being added to the Nevada.

1244
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:32,256
This isn't the same thing as saying that all the Absurd right-wing media claims about the laptop Ark

1245
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,024
Confirmed

1246
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:38,656
It's not even saying that the basis for a lot of those claims is authenticated because these people like the Rudy

1247
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:40,448
Giuliani's of the world and such

1248
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:41,472
They may be working

1249
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:44,288
From a copy of the data that had filed added to them

1250
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:50,944
All the CBS piece can really assert is that the expert they spoke to didn't see signs of tampering in the data directly

1251
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:51,712
From the source

1252
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:55,552
This isn't necessarily as much of a win is Owen wants it to be

1253
01:20:55,808 --> 01:21:00,928
He doesn't get to congratulate himself for being part of a media organization that made a ton of s*** up about the laptop

1254
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:03,744
After an actual media organization do some legwork

1255
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,536
It doesn't actually prove in towards

1256
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:07,328
Also

1257
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:08,608
I fucken love this segment

1258
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:09,632
Hello

1259
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:11,424
This development so much

1260
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:16,032
Now I guess Alex and Infowars need to protect Joe Biden at all costs

1261
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:22,688
If they attack him they're just doing the globalist bidding because they weren't biting out-of-the-way it's a trap

1262
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,224
That's what I'm saying

1263
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,504
Yeah right hand

1264
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:26,784
They're just

1265
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:27,552
That is just

1266
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:28,576
Non-Stop

1267
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:34,720
I don't think it may I don't think it does make them feel good I don't think it makes him feel good

1268
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:38,560
For CBS News to somehow pretend to confirm that they're right

1269
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:40,864
Even if they were right which they're not

1270
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:47,520
Also I just tried to Pat myself on the back

1271
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:50,080
I don't say that.

1272
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:53,152
Tough to pull off a sarcastic

1273
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:54,944
But

1274
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,224
One of the easiest

1275
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:58,272
Mistakes a lot of people

1276
01:21:58,784 --> 01:21:59,552
You think

1277
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:00,832
It should go on

1278
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:02,880
You don't need it to go on

1279
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:04,672
Four claps

1280
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:06,208
Maximum is all you need to know

1281
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:07,744
Sewing

1282
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,304
Get back talking about the shooting and of course

1283
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:12,096
Just distraction

1284
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:18,496
Deflection course

1285
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:07,136
This is desperately Owen doesn't want to address

1286
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:09,440
The actual point and talk about the actual shooting

1287
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:16,096
Yes it is like so much that he's decided to play a game of shooting roulette with the producers which even if he finds a tunnel

1288
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:18,656
Shootings across the country doesn't prove a point he wants

1289
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:22,496
Set to if anything makes a stronger case for gun reform

1290
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:23,776
Yeah but again

1291
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:25,056
This is important to remember

1292
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:28,128
He's the one who doesn't care about these shootings in the intercept

1293
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:31,712
He's the one who sees them as a prop adjusted

1294
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:36,064
We can use to distract away from having to talk about the shootings that had a little too close to home

1295
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:42,720
People talk very constantly about addressing violence in inner cities it's just a towing never hears those voices because they're part of it

1296
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:44,256
Community but he doesn't give a s*** about

1297
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:47,840
These are predominantly poor and non-white communities so

1298
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:49,376
He doesn't hear them

1299
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:50,400
Care at all

1300
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:51,680
Please

1301
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:58,336
Let's play this game of roulette let's do it. Let's see what you get to say is

1302
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:01,152
I think this is a great job Owen

1303
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,224
Oh man

1304
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:08,064
Good work

1305
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:11,136
Still defending myself on the back again didn't work

1306
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:14,464
So he's just going to try to water because it doesn't go smoothly

1307
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:20,352
As I thought that maybe these producers would find headlines right away water

1308
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:40,992
I mean that's

1309
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:44,832
That's an insane that's just

1310
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:47,648
That is a person whose lives under a rock

1311
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:49,440
And is told news

1312
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:54,304
From a f****** an insane bro and personally have not seen his home

1313
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:58,144
So I don't know if it's under a rock

1314
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,424
He does just

1315
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:05,824
Deaf people hand him fixed

1316
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:15,296
No like awareness of political issues that aren't germane to the Infowars core message

1317
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:19,136
He doesn't know about political

1318
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:26,048
Movement to activists that are working on other issues like inner-city violence

1319
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:27,328
Tensor

1320
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:30,656
It's

1321
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:32,192
Muted

1322
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:34,240
It's not relevant to him he doesn't give us

1323
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:37,056
Yeah so it will course he has this this

1324
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:38,592
Sort of conception that

1325
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:41,408
No one cares

1326
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:47,808
You're the only person who cared then you could go find people who care

1327
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:50,880
And unfortunately you're sad fairly can't fly

1328
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:53,952
You know what I've noticed

1329
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:55,488
Listening to this much Owen

1330
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:56,512
Is that

1331
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:57,280
Owen

1332
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:59,072
Has the

1333
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:02,400
Cadence and the lack of

1334
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:05,472
Value to anything that he saying

1335
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:11,872
That requires him to make a point and then landed in order for it to sound logical

1336
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:18,272
Exactly and Alex doesn't need to land upon to do any of this s***

1337
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:21,856
Chaos exactly like that's the thing that Owen wants

1338
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:23,392
And can never have

1339
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:26,976
And I think that that's one of the things that makes him so boring like

1340
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:31,072
Alex like I said earlier he's unpredictable in a in a certain way

1341
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:36,960
He does get boring sometimes and there's a lot of repetition but there is still an ice age

1342
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:39,264
Anything Could Happen

1343
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:43,616
He could storm out confidence to storm out of the studio

1344
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:46,944
Yeah give a s*** because he runs the plates right

1345
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:47,968
Owen doesn't have

1346
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:53,600
That and he's a really boring because if you have to land your

1347
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:55,648
Points or argument or anything

1348
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,184
Then the landing should be

1349
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:03,584
Be good if you wanted to be interesting or the landing to be interesting and it Landing isn't superficial stupid

1350
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:04,864
Choir DeLand

1351
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:07,680
Is he needs his producers to feed him

1352
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:10,496
Yeah and that is not coming

1353
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:11,776
Find a headline

1354
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:26,624
Against

1355
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:59,392
I guess the girls having a hard time here we talked about this earlier in the bomb threat charges were

1356
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:04,768
Filed so there's no reason to think the FBI had any involvement in the case nor that they were following Aldrich

1357
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:11,424
Bring this up I guess it's worth noting that there were

1358
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:14,240
Confiscation of aldrich's guns after the bomb threat

1359
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:18,336
What Ellen sport that kind of law or would that be a violation of the Second Amendment

1360
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:22,176
Baby doesn't support confiscating guns from people to make terrorist bomb threat

1361
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:26,016
Describe doesn't really make sense here it seems irrelevant

1362
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:28,576
101 is doing is

1363
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:31,648
He's trying to say that this was a false flag without saying it directly

1364
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:38,048
The FBI got in contact with Aldridge after the bomb threat and then use them as a patsy or a mind-control sleeper age

1365
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:39,072
Agent or some s***

1366
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:43,168
Is the consistent pattern with Alex's mass shooting conspiracies from James Holmes

1367
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:44,192
Adam Lanza

1368
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:49,312
And always signal into that knowing that the audience is well aware of what he saying without directly saying it

1369
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:50,336
Yeah good for you

1370
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:53,920
My my lit teacher when I was in high school

1371
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:57,504
I was with him all four years and we beat we became pretty close

1372
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,856
He always used to say sarcastically at my dad

1373
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:04,928
That sarcasm is a tool of the weak mind

1374
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:06,976
Right but

1375
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,536
When he did say it genuinely

1376
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:12,352
He was speaking specifically about Owen Shroyer

1377
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,192
Satire

1378
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:18,496
So he's still got to kill more time cuz

1379
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:19,776
Is that lines are coming

1380
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:42,560
Where are you landing on this

1381
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:44,096
What is happening

1382
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:46,144
Coherent

1383
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:57,408
The patrons neutralize the threat of the gunman

1384
01:30:57,664 --> 01:31:00,992
But according to they could have done it even better

1385
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:02,272
If someone had a gun

1386
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:03,040
Weird

1387
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:05,600
F****** stupid and that's dangerous as an idea

1388
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:12,000
Odds are that someone with a gun wouldn't have been able to subdue the shooter much quicker than they did and in a crowded

1389
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:18,400
It's really dangerous to be in a situation where you're exchanging gunfire really high likelihood of hitting an

1390
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:19,168
Another Patron

1391
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:25,824
Really dumb stuff but I guess it's the only thing better than a good guy who takes care of Business Without a Gun is a hypothetical

1392
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:26,848
Good guy with a gun

1393
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:28,128
Who does a better

1394
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:29,408
Jobstack ask

1395
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:34,272
Looks like those producers aren't having an easy time finding a shooting that fits Owens a narrative here

1396
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:35,040
Weird

1397
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:38,112
Yeah I mean it doesn't get more obvious

1398
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:40,416
Exactly what's going on

1399
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:41,184
Then

1400
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:44,768
The right-wing being like this guy who

1401
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:48,608
Neutralize the shooter he can go f*** himself cuz he didn't have a gun

1402
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:49,888
Really weird what are you

1403
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:54,752
You talking about that's not a hero to you is that the hero regardless of

1404
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:59,616
Political ideology right but also like is it a better outcome

1405
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:03,712
For someone to have killed the shooter then for them to face

1406
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:05,504
Consequences

1407
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:07,808
Be tried in a court

1408
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:11,392
There's a I don't understand I mean I do understand

1409
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:12,672
Yeah of course

1410
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:18,560
There can no no Heroes cannot be found White

1411
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:23,680
Adnan Malik it is like the only hero

1412
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:25,472
Is our fictional John Wayne

1413
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:27,776
If the real John Wayne was gay

1414
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:30,080
Which we can't ever possibly believe

1415
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:32,640
Sewing

1416
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:33,408
Do some headlines

1417
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:35,968
Not good

1418
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:50,304
I don't know if the producers are asleep at the wheel or what but I guess Owens just going to reuse the same headlines you brought up on Sunday

1419
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:52,096
A show which seems a little bit soft

1420
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:57,216
If these are the things he insists no one cares about I would suggest you look a little bit deeper

1421
01:32:57,728 --> 01:33:03,104
The first shooting Adventure doesn't Baltimore and if interested he could check out the Abell Foundation

1422
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,664
A nonprofit committed to combating gun violence

1423
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:09,248
Baltimore through investing in community programs that aim to intervene

1424
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:12,576
Hidden an at-risk situations and prevent future viola

1425
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:19,232
In 2021 they dispensed / 14 billion dollars in Grants to community-based projects in areas like Workforce

1426
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:20,768
Education and the Arts

1427
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:27,168
This is a group that takes the problem of gun violence in Baltimore very seriously and is working to address the underlying causes

1428
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:28,448
And influence others

1429
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:34,336
Or if you wanted to go like a more religious route he could discuss the Catholic Charities Safe Streets Baltimore

1430
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:37,920
Many other groups to and this is an issue that's disgusting widely

1431
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:40,992
I'm second to no one brings up his outside Philly

1432
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:43,808
Have the same Dynamic is true in Philly as it is in Baltimore

1433
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:46,624
Are tons of people at Goodwill working hard to create

1434
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,416
Solutions to the problem of violence with

1435
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:49,440
Community-based initiatives

1436
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:55,072
The premise that no one talks about these shootings because they are politically useful or whatever is just false

1437
01:33:55,584 --> 01:33:56,096
It's just

1438
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:57,120
01

1439
01:33:57,376 --> 01:34:03,520
What are the issues with what's going on is that either right-wing does rising tide of anti-lgbt Q sentiment that a bunch of

1440
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:06,336
To make a name for themselves in that media sphere

1441
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:07,360
The lives of

1442
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:11,456
Tik-Tok account essentially exists solely to demonize trans people and drag performer

1443
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:18,112
Matt Walters entire brand now seems to be the guy who's really weird and angry but other people sexuality and

1444
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:24,512
Alex Stein put himself on the map I sexually harassing AOC and I was making antagonistic videos of drag queen story

1445
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:29,632
Auntie trans talking points field way more than one GOP midterm campaign

1446
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:33,216
It'll be hard to find a right-wing media pundit who didn't traffic in the

1447
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:35,520
Calling random lgbtq folks

1448
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:37,568
Groomers for horrible crimes like

1449
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:38,848
Being a teacher

1450
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:45,504
In this environment it's clear that a Target is being put on a particular Community who are being scapegoated and used as a punching

1451
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:46,272
Back 4 blood

1452
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:47,040
Google points

1453
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:51,648
That's a scary and dangerous situation that we all understand leads to violence

1454
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:56,768
We've already seen Children's Hospitals targeted for bomb threats after being pointed out by lives of Tik-Tok

1455
01:34:57,536 --> 01:35:02,400
Cowboys have shown up and crash drag queen Story Time yelling about grooming kids off and well-armed

1456
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:07,264
It's Crystal Clear to anyone paying attention that this is a situation where the ice is thin

1457
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:11,616
And the people who are escalating this tension and raising the temperature have no intention of stopping

1458
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:16,224
So when there's a mass shooting like this at a gay bar like what we saw in Colorado Springs

1459
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:22,624
It's very easy to understand how that that hit particularly hard for people who care about and respect lgbtq

1460
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:24,928
The writing has been on the wall

1461
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:26,976
What something like this was bound to happen

1462
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:31,328
The people who were inciting hate gleefully continue to do so at them

1463
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:32,608
The horrific happened

1464
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:38,496
At the time of doing this episode it does remained to be seen fully with the motive for the shooting was

1465
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:44,128
It's easy to jump to conclusion to this was definitely an anti-lgbtq motivated

1466
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:47,456
And I think that the preliminary information points in that direction

1467
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:51,296
But it is possible that there's another another motive there they were yet to learn

1468
01:35:51,808 --> 01:35:53,088
Even if that is the case

1469
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:54,368
It doesn't change anything

1470
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:56,928
About why an event like this would be particularly pain

1471
01:35:57,696 --> 01:36:03,840
A community suffers a tremendous loss and a deprivation of a place where they felt like they could be safe while the entire media

1472
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:05,120
Ecosystem demonizes

1473
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:06,656
And dehumanizes

1474
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:07,680
Pain response

1475
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:12,544
How did immediately ecosystem pretends that the shooting is actually their fault because they hosted Drag Brunch of

1476
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:19,200
The actual shooter's motive aside the toxicity and fully committed nature of the anti-lgbtq positioning

1477
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:22,016
Of these right-wing figures is on Full display

1478
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:22,784
And it's repulsive

1479
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:29,696
Anyway if Owen wants to continue playing this game where he has an intern Google shootings that he can pretend to care about I guess we can do that

1480
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:30,720
But

1481
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:32,000
Is

1482
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:34,816
Very clearly ignoring a

1483
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:36,608
Celia difference

1484
01:36:36,864 --> 01:36:37,632
Between things

1485
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:40,192
Because it's threatening it implicates

1486
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:40,960
His worldview

1487
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:43,008
Maybe I just think it's pathetic

1488
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:44,288
Yeah

1489
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:45,824
Yeah I mean

1490
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:49,664
It's it's hard

1491
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:52,224
To have lived through so many f******

1492
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:53,248
King genocide

1493
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:55,296
Around the world

1494
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:57,856
That have happened

1495
01:36:58,624 --> 01:37:00,160
Beginning with this type of rhetoric

1496
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:02,976
And not look at this type of rhetoric

1497
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:05,792
Happening around us and and not be

1498
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:08,352
F****** me the outcome is not good

1499
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:11,936
The next stages after

1500
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:15,776
These kinds of portrayals of people it doesn't lead to

1501
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:17,568
Acceptance

1502
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:20,896
We come to a greater understanding of each other

1503
01:37:21,152 --> 01:37:22,688
Note that is not the path

1504
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:24,736
That the right-wing media figures

1505
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:26,272
Like we we discussed

1506
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:27,040
How many inches

1507
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,600
And that is troubling

1508
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:30,368
Yep

1509
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:31,392
Sewing

1510
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:33,440
Heather revelation

1511
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:34,976
Cow

1512
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:36,256
Using what

1513
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:38,048
Braids wear

1514
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:38,816
It is had

Victorian Farm

1516
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:29,248
Reasoning or even

1517

Thomas Rhett

1518
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:10,720
What

1519
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:15,584
This is f****** pathetic

1520
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:19,424
I want is presenting this is a revelation he had while looking at his news

1521
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:25,824
That the globalist need to disarm Americans because they can't bring in a world government with so many armed Patriots out there I mean this is a

1522
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,872
New thought that he's pretending

1523
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:31,456
This is the most Elementary Infowars talking point going back

1524
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:32,736
Decade

1525
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:39,136
Portamento talking point of the entire thing the whole reason they want to take guns according to Alex's.

1526
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:45,536
Reminder reason constant rambling is because they needed on our population who can't fight back when the UN troops are the devil

1527
01:39:45,792 --> 01:39:47,328
Foreclosure wob invade

1528
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:53,984
This is 101 stuff and honestly this would be like me coming here on episode 751 of our podcast and

1529
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:57,824
But I looked at this stuff I listen to Alex and I do like

1530
01:39:58,336 --> 01:39:58,848
It dawned on me

1531
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:00,384
That they aren't sincere about

1532
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:01,408
Got the things I say

1533
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:04,224
Just hits me that they ramp up bulshit in order to push

1534
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:08,320
Extremist right-wing ideology until useless product so they're terrified entrapped audio

1535
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:10,880
What a revelation I just had

1536
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:14,208
It's ridiculous when he started

1537
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:17,792
I wrote down it's nice that they can still learn about the global

1538
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:19,328
It's nice

1539
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:25,728
Well they said he tended and I was like you can't learn anything about the global at this this is

1540
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:31,616
Tactic that people can use to make at right thing sounds somehow more important

1541
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:36,224
Did the same thing when Alex is like last night I was thinking and I saw the full picture you know or whatever

1542
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:42,624
Is a grandiose elevation of a Monday and claim it makes me feel

1543
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:44,672
Like what I remember from

1544
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:47,744
K-lite for like youth groups and when I was in church

1545
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:49,280
And like it would be like

1546
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:50,304
I had this revelation

1547
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:52,096
God

1548
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:52,864
Love's

1549
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:56,448
Yeah you know it's like okay you had that revelation

1550
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:59,008
But like you're not understanding

1551
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:00,288
He loved

1552
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:01,824
Right okay

1553
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:03,104
Alright

1554
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:04,128
Previously

1555
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,152
I do

1556
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:08,480
Also makes me think of times when I hang out with people who are too hot

1557
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:13,600
Reminds me of when a boss would come in and be like hey babe

1558
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:14,368
I just realized

1559
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,160
I'm wearing shoes

1560
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:22,560
Everybody's doing their regular a***** sitting in front of the computer every now and again talk in the boss comes in as I hate

1561
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:24,352
I just had this idea

1562
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:26,400
What if we tried an ad campaign

1563
01:41:26,912 --> 01:41:28,960
And you're like that is how business works

1564
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:34,592
I don't know what else to say to you the globalist want to take guns because they need to today world

1565
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:40,992
Yeah you should watch some of Alex's Phelps also you can't arm 300 million Americans

1566
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,040
Because some of them are baby

1567
01:41:43,296 --> 01:41:43,808
Wow

1568
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:44,576
Now

1569
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:48,416
According to Gallatin now

1570
01:41:49,184 --> 01:41:55,328
Fair

1571
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:56,096
Conceivably use

1572
01:41:56,352 --> 01:42:01,472
Like I mean obviously there

1573
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:03,008
So

1574
01:42:04,032 --> 01:42:04,800
Illenium tickets

1575
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:53,184
Not necessarily worse because the shooting happened at a gay nightclub like a shooting like this would be bad no matter what

1576
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:56,000
There's an element that Owen is intentionally ignoring

1577
01:42:56,512 --> 01:42:59,328
It's worse that this shooting happened at a gay club because we're

1578
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:04,192
Currently existing at a time of increased anti-lgbtq

1579
01:43:04,448 --> 01:43:07,264
And a time when the prevailing attitude

1580
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:13,664
Is that we should regress back to a time when Society had absolutely zero tolerance for any nonsense non-straight identifying

1581
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:20,064
A shooting it appears to Target that community at a time when that rhetoric is flying around the right-wing freely

1582
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:22,624
Does sting a little more than it might otherwise

1583
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:26,720
But mass shootings particularly in public places are awful no matter what

1584
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:30,816
The shooting at the Walmart in Virginia last week is a horrible tragedy for example

1585
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:33,632
Just

1586
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:36,704
I just don't think that this is an honest

1587
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:39,776
Exploration of anyone

1588
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:43,104
Anyone's actual feelings I got to believe they don't actually feels

1589
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:46,944
I don't know what he feels but this is not like

1590
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:49,760
This is not a well-considered

1591
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:54,112
Dealing with reality well I mean what they want

1592
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:55,392
Is

1593
01:43:55,648 --> 01:43:56,928
To say okay

1594
01:43:57,184 --> 01:43:59,744
We all recognize that gun violence is a problem

1595
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,304
How about our solution is we do nothing

1596
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:07,168
And then we get to continue yelling at our politicians about how they do do anyting

1597
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:09,472
Which I'm telling you that they shouldn't do

1598
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:14,848
So then you can yell about these politicians that don't do anything and you'll believe that I'm helping you in some

1599
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:19,200
Beyond all reason and then you'll blame the politician

1600
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:22,784
Still listen to me and anyways the point is I'm going to be rich

1601
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:24,832
The popular for people are going to

1602
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:26,112
Populist message

1603
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:27,904
Just going to be a chicken in every pot

1604
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:30,464
And a derringer and every create absolutely

1605
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:33,280
What should your little baby

1606
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:34,560
Bjorn b-but

1607
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:35,840
Is something with like

1608
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:37,888
Rifle standing at the other end

1609
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:39,424
So

1610
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:42,752
One pointed at your face to make sure you take care of that baby right

1611
01:44:43,264 --> 01:44:44,544
The one thing that I've noticed

1612
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:46,336
Is that

1613
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:47,616
Look at this a revelation

1614
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:52,736
I don't know how I couldn't have noticed this before but Infowars lies

1615
01:44:52,992 --> 01:44:54,528
Who's Mexico

1616
01:44:54,784 --> 01:44:57,600
Talk about the shooting Owen

1617
01:44:58,112 --> 01:44:58,624
Lots

1618
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:03,648
20 by your gun in Owens just lying

1619
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:06,464
He's just making up a shooter was on an FBI watchlist

1620
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:09,536
Because if he makes up that detail it makes the shooting

1621
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:11,840
Way more suspicious to the audience

1622
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:14,656
And encourages them not to take it at all seriously

1623
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:17,216
Well Owen and sister the anti-lgbt

1624
01:46:17,472 --> 01:46:21,312
Uq ideology can't possibly be the motive for the attack and no one knows the motive

1625
01:46:21,568 --> 01:46:24,640
He feels like it's somehow appropriate for him to just make s*** up

1626
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:26,944
In order to build up his imaginary motive

1627
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:30,016
And explanation for the shooting in this is just f****** disgusting

1628
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:31,552
Making s*** up

1629
01:46:32,064 --> 01:46:32,576
I mean look

1630
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:36,672
Sometimes there is a certain amount of jumping to conclusions that happens

1631
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:41,024
There's some assumptions that this is a factual lot

1632
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:42,816
This is just something that he's saying

1633
01:46:43,072 --> 01:46:44,864
Because it works better for him

1634
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:46,400
Which is Infowars Style

1635
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:47,680
Yeah yeah

1636
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:49,216
He's just so stupid

1637
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:53,312
He's just so dumb these just so dumb

1638
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:54,592
But also boring

1639
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:55,616
Yeah I know

1640
01:46:55,872 --> 01:46:57,408
It is it is unfortunate

1641
01:46:57,664 --> 01:46:59,968
The length of time he's allowed to speak

1642
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:00,736
In public

1643
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:01,760
Yeah

1644
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:02,784
I mean money

1645
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:03,808
That's problem

1646
01:47:04,064 --> 01:47:06,112
So speaking of things that went on too long

1647
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:08,416
Yeah Alex complain about Twitter

1648
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:09,952
Too long

1649
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:12,256
But Owens got a touch on

1650
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:17,120
Power

1651
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:43,744
Yeah for a South African Emerald minor

1652
01:47:58,592 --> 01:48:00,384
Elan

1653
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:43,904
Beautiful words

1654
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:50,304
Is embarrassing

1655
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:56,960
So you know he's trying to make the argument that people who talk about school shootings

1656
01:48:57,216 --> 01:48:58,496
To push for gun reform naturally

1657
01:48:58,752 --> 01:49:01,568
Those are the people who

1658
01:49:01,824 --> 01:49:04,896
I would love to play this game with all window

1659
01:49:05,152 --> 01:49:06,176
Cuz he's at a track

1660
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:08,480
I guess you just wants everyone

1661
01:49:08,736 --> 01:49:12,576
Who could be accused of using the deaths of children for political gain to be kicked off Twitter so

1662
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:16,416
Yuan will be morally and intellectually consistent if he does

1663
01:49:17,952 --> 01:49:24,096
I guess we can make a really clean sweep of all anti-vaxxers that because their whole thing is just using the deaths of children is prop

1664
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:27,936
Apps to build up their political power

1665
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:30,752
To every abortion advocates

1666
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:37,152
No I think I wouldn't like it too much of his standard was applied but he's having a lot of fun here saying Elon

1667
01:49:37,408 --> 01:49:38,688
Condescendingly my God

1668
01:49:38,944 --> 01:49:39,712
He's just the worst

1669
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:46,112
Also owned is conveniently leaving off of Elon says that the reason that he has no mercy for someone like Alex is that

1670
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:50,208
My first born child died in my arms I felt his last heartbeat

1671
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:56,864
Owen probably doesn't want to go anywhere near that considering that his claims that Neil heslin couldn't have held his son after the show

1672
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:57,888
Shooting at Sandy Hook

1673
01:49:58,144 --> 01:50:00,704
Kind of at the Centre of a lot of the lawsuits and

1674
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:02,240
I would understand if he was once

1675
01:50:02,496 --> 01:50:03,264
Bitten Twice Shy

1676
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:05,824
I would totally ignore that part two but

1677
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:06,848
It's kind of glaring

1678
01:50:07,104 --> 01:50:07,616
Yeah

1679
01:50:08,896 --> 01:50:09,408
What you going to do

1680
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:11,968
I think what's funny about that is that this time

1681
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:15,296
He might actually have a better chance of saying that

1682
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:16,320
Because

1683
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:17,600
The it did

1684
01:50:17,856 --> 01:50:18,368
Elon Musk

1685
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:20,416
Without the mother of that child

1686
01:50:21,696 --> 01:50:23,232
Reply to Elon musk's tweet

1687
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:24,256
Saying

1688
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:30,656
I know I'm the only person who cares cuz I was the one there but I was the one holding the I think I saw a

1689
01:50:30,912 --> 01:50:31,424
I don't know if that's

1690
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:35,776
True or not but what I'm saying is that if you were going to say that he didn't

1691
01:50:36,032 --> 01:50:37,824
You have far more to go on

1692
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:40,640
Anything else I understand where you're coming from

1693
01:50:40,896 --> 01:50:44,992
You touch that hot stove

1694
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:51,136
So I believe he's a fan of the Santas a bit or at least the things that he saying

1695
01:50:51,392 --> 01:50:52,672
And this is funny

1696
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:03,424
For any of our electric America

1697
01:51:23,648 --> 01:51:28,256
Aurora.

1698
01:51:30,304 --> 01:51:33,632
Why are.

1699
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:43,872
Can hear in my mind the cheers of not existing people

1700
01:51:44,384 --> 01:51:45,152
Oh boy

1701
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:51,552
Now there weren't tears but imagine them was when Albert born

1702
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:56,928
Cheat on ALEKS

1703
01:51:57,184 --> 01:51:57,696
I suppose

1704
01:51:57,952 --> 01:52:04,096
Yelling saying that the world economic forum is not welcome in Florida is not the Applause line that

1705
01:52:04,352 --> 01:52:04,864
You might be thinking

1706
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:05,888
On account of

1707
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:09,216
What the f*** are you talking about what do you mean

1708
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:09,984
King about

1709
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:11,008
So

1710
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:12,800
Owen touches on Ukraine

1711
01:52:13,056 --> 01:52:15,360
A little bit yeah he's the person I want

1712
01:52:15,616 --> 01:52:17,408
Insightful, do ya

1713
01:52:25,344 --> 01:52:27,392
Civil War

1714
01:52:28,672 --> 01:52:34,816
Not how that works

1715
01:52:45,568 --> 01:52:46,592
I mean

1716
01:53:31,904 --> 01:53:37,280
Sowell human rights abuses are alleged to have been committed by Ukrainian forces as well as Russian forces

1717
01:53:37,536 --> 01:53:39,072
Is this explanation that Owen is giving his

1718
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:40,096
Is b*******

1719
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:46,496
This is embarrassing Libro Russia and its Framing and anyone who took their job is a news commentator seriously wood

1720
01:53:46,752 --> 01:53:47,776
Do this bad a job

1721
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:53,920
Quick note that you responded to Russia and Ukraine cannot be in a civil war

1722
01:53:54,176 --> 01:54:00,320
In essence Russia had the right to invade territory that is Ukraine

1723
01:54:00,576 --> 01:54:03,904
The only reason there's any problem is because Ukraine fought back with some westerns

1724
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:04,672
Support

1725
01:54:04,928 --> 01:54:11,072
State TV

1726
01:54:11,328 --> 01:54:14,400
Quickly executed an Russia installing a puppet head of state

1727
01:54:14,912 --> 01:54:16,192
That is Russia's right

1728
01:54:16,448 --> 01:54:21,824
To do that's what they have the right to do and because Ukraine didn't go along with it now all this bad stuff is happening

1729
01:54:22,592 --> 01:54:26,688
It's actually fairly similar in theme to comments that they're coming out about the Club Q shooting

1730
01:54:26,944 --> 01:54:28,480
Particularly the way that Matt Walsh

1731
01:54:28,736 --> 01:54:29,760
Contempo wood frame

1732
01:54:30,272 --> 01:54:34,624
The shooting happened because the club had a Drag Brunch that they decided to it was a groomer

1733
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:36,928
It was the shooter's right

1734
01:54:37,184 --> 01:54:43,328
For there not to be a drag brunch at this bar but the government of police didn't shut it down for it so even invaded

1735
01:54:43,584 --> 01:54:44,096
To take care of

1736
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:48,448
In both cases there's a state of affairs that they have deemed to be correct

1737
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:54,592
Ukraine it's that Russia could do whatever it wants and in the case of clubque it's at lgbtq folks

1738
01:54:54,848 --> 01:54:58,176
Can't do anything if it in any way offends the extreme right-wing

1739
01:54:58,688 --> 01:55:02,784
Ukraine didn't been to Russia's demand so they're really responsible for Russia invading

1740
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:08,160
You didn't do exactly what the extreme right side so it's their own fault when violence is an actor

1741
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:12,512
You really troubling mentality and if you think about it for even a minute

1742
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:15,328
It's not hard to see how this could be applied very easily

1743
01:55:15,584 --> 01:55:16,608
To justify

1744
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:18,144
Particularly against groups

1745
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:19,936
That you expect yours

1746
01:55:20,192 --> 01:55:23,008
Demonizing and dehumanize I'm not even going to engage with that

1747
01:55:23,264 --> 01:55:24,544
I'm going to engage with

1748
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:25,568
His own

1749
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:27,872
Okay so what he saying

1750
01:55:28,384 --> 01:55:31,456
Is that what he should what Ukraine should have done

1751
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:34,016
Is allowed the Russian government

1752
01:55:34,528 --> 01:55:35,552
To come in

1753
01:55:36,064 --> 01:55:38,624
And disarm the citizens of Ukraine

1754
01:55:39,392 --> 01:55:41,952
Does taking over their territory

1755
01:55:43,232 --> 01:55:45,280
Installing a fascist dictatorship

1756
01:55:45,536 --> 01:55:48,096
Do understand that correctly because

1757
01:55:48,864 --> 01:55:49,632
Consistent

1758
01:55:49,888 --> 01:55:51,424
Just want to be sure

1759
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:53,216
That that was what he was saying

1760
01:55:53,984 --> 01:55:55,520
They should have done

1761
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:56,800
Thereby saying

1762
01:55:57,056 --> 01:55:57,824
That the correct

1763
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:58,592
Answer

1764
01:55:59,104 --> 01:56:00,128
To globalism

1765
01:56:00,384 --> 01:56:01,920
Is for the United States

1766
01:56:02,432 --> 01:56:07,040
To lower its weapons give them to the world economic forum

1767
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:08,832
Because the world economic

1768
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:15,232
Forum is the world and we're just one country so they own everybody so they can just walk in and what

1769
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:19,072
We should do

1770
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:20,864
We should give up our arms

1771
01:56:21,376 --> 01:56:22,656
To the government well

1772
01:56:22,912 --> 01:56:23,680
We might actually say that

1773
01:56:24,192 --> 01:56:29,312
That's actually quite a bit about how

1774
01:56:29,568 --> 01:56:34,176
I just don't understand how people to repair this relationship with

1775
01:56:34,432 --> 01:56:34,944
It's just

1776
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:36,992
It's that same thing of like

1777
01:56:37,248 --> 01:56:39,552
What they're saying is so obviously

1778
01:56:39,808 --> 01:56:40,320
Stupid

1779
01:56:40,832 --> 01:56:41,344
Haunted space

1780
01:56:41,856 --> 01:56:43,648
But it goes against what they're saying

1781
01:56:44,672 --> 01:56:45,440
Because

1782
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:49,024
Matt Walsh making fun of look at you with your fake gun

1783
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:50,816
What are you talkin about

1784
01:56:51,072 --> 01:56:56,704
This guy would have been a hero if only he'd shot the guy instead of stopping him from killing people

1785
01:56:56,960 --> 01:57:00,544
Well this guy would have been the one that we should never give up our arms but Ukraine city

1786
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:02,336
Into the Night

1787
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:09,504
What you're wrestling with his that nothing means anything in these are all just incendiary

1788
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:12,576
And irresponsible poorly thought-out argument right

1789
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:16,416
Made for their own sake and for the sake of getting through the day

1790
01:57:16,672 --> 01:57:20,000
Advanced ideology and selling dump pills

1791
01:57:20,256 --> 01:57:24,864
Yes that is what I'm grappling with Revelation I just had

1792
01:57:25,376 --> 01:57:31,520
So I wouldn't get back to talking about the drag queen story times and the

1793
01:57:31,776 --> 01:57:34,848
Idea that there would be people armed there

1794
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:40,736
And just to advance a little bit of a warning we got some T slurs coming up

1795
01:57:41,248 --> 01:57:42,528
Because of course

1796
01:57:42,784 --> 01:57:43,552
Because of course

1797
01:57:43,808 --> 01:57:46,112
Stand so here here is it just some

1798
01:57:46,368 --> 01:57:47,648
Dumb commentary

1799
01:58:51,136 --> 01:58:54,208
You covered this with Alex Stein yesterday I know you doing

1800
01:58:54,976 --> 01:58:56,256
This is ridiculous

1801
01:58:56,512 --> 01:59:02,656
You can hear the the Sorcerer And the the the way that this is being covered ASD human

1802
01:59:02,912 --> 01:59:05,472
Sizing and demonizing of the people there

1803
01:59:05,728 --> 01:59:10,336
Exactly the the problem that people are discussing

1804
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:13,408
Basically making the argument for everyone

1805
01:59:13,664 --> 01:59:18,784
Yep one last clip here where he struggles to understand people showing up arm

1806
01:59:19,296 --> 01:59:20,064
Toguard

1807
01:59:20,576 --> 01:59:22,368
And I find that to be

1808
01:59:35,168 --> 01:59:37,216
God dammit man

1809
01:59:56,672 --> 01:59:57,696
The red lamp

1810
01:59:57,952 --> 01:59:59,232
So first of all there are plenty

1811
01:59:59,488 --> 02:00:01,536
There's a lot of schools that do have

1812
02:00:01,792 --> 02:00:03,072
Armed officers

1813
02:00:03,328 --> 02:00:06,144
Explain this to him it's actually really simple

1814
02:00:07,424 --> 02:00:13,568
People who are going there guarding that event they were there as officials hired by the state which they would like

1815
02:00:13,824 --> 02:00:15,872
We have to be if they weren't there guarding a school

1816
02:00:16,128 --> 02:00:22,272
Super complicated administrative process to happen where is this people take me to Pond themselves to show up

1817
02:00:22,528 --> 02:00:23,808
Open practice their second amendment rights

1818
02:00:24,064 --> 02:00:24,832
Jojo and should love

1819
02:00:25,344 --> 02:00:26,880
Secondly there's a bit of difference

1820
02:00:27,136 --> 02:00:28,416
Between these events in schools

1821
02:00:28,928 --> 02:00:31,232
He probably is in groups of right-wing lunatic

1822
02:00:31,488 --> 02:00:37,632
Expect a steady diet of Sensational and bigoted narratives about how the schools were secret grooming programs targeting kids

1823
02:00:37,888 --> 02:00:39,936
Is routinely to disrupt things

1824
02:00:40,192 --> 02:00:46,336
And if they were bomb threats being directed at schools that were pointed out by anti-lgbtq social media

1825
02:00:46,592 --> 02:00:50,176
And an entire section of the media was obsessed with demonizing

1826
02:00:50,432 --> 02:00:51,200
Schools and teachers

1827
02:00:51,712 --> 02:00:54,016
In that instance maybe antifa would show up

1828
02:00:54,272 --> 02:00:54,784
Open schools

1829
02:00:55,296 --> 02:00:56,576
Isn't happening in the case of

1830
02:00:56,832 --> 02:00:57,600
The schools but it is

1831
02:00:57,856 --> 02:00:58,624
In the case of lgbtq

1832
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:01,952
Tiki space is particularly focused around drag queen story time

1833
02:01:02,208 --> 02:01:02,976
So you can make

1834
02:01:04,512 --> 02:01:06,560
Owen is a part of the media ecosystem that is

1835
02:01:06,816 --> 02:01:08,352
Obsesses about these events

1836
02:01:08,608 --> 02:01:13,472
Lies about them sinsational Liza's them labels people involved in pedophile zandor demon

1837
02:01:13,984 --> 02:01:17,824
Helen Marvels at the idea that people would show up to provide security from the people who can

1838
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:20,640
Sumac media and show up to antagonize

1839
02:01:20,896 --> 02:01:21,664
And disrupt the event

1840
02:01:22,432 --> 02:01:23,200
He knows what he's doing

1841
02:01:23,456 --> 02:01:23,968
And this is

1842
02:01:24,224 --> 02:01:24,736
Very weak

1843
02:01:24,992 --> 02:01:26,016
Also

1844
02:01:26,272 --> 02:01:31,136
He does realize that this video he's talking about it's on the same weekend that there was a mass shooting at a gay bar

1845
02:01:31,392 --> 02:01:36,512
Did high-profile right-wing figures are justifying by saying that there was a drag brunch at that bar Rodney this is insane

1846
02:01:37,024 --> 02:01:38,816
I don't I don't understand how he can

1847
02:01:39,328 --> 02:01:44,192
I can understand it but I couldn't understand or someone acting from the place of

1848
02:01:44,704 --> 02:01:46,240
Like decent intention

1849
02:01:46,496 --> 02:01:47,264
Could

1850
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:49,312
Make these kinds of points

1851
02:01:49,568 --> 02:01:50,336
It's

1852
02:01:50,848 --> 02:01:55,456
Yeah I know I mean that's that's the type of thing that you can't say in my

1853
02:01:56,224 --> 02:01:58,528
I mean wow

1854
02:01:58,784 --> 02:01:59,552
Just f******

1855
02:01:59,808 --> 02:02:01,088
Wow it's bad

1856
02:02:01,344 --> 02:02:01,856
Wow

1857
02:02:02,112 --> 02:02:04,160
The coverage that they have is bad

1858
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:06,720
Ayodhya

1859
02:02:06,976 --> 02:02:10,560
I wrestle with whether or not I find

1860
02:02:10,816 --> 02:02:12,608
And it more objectionable

1861
02:02:12,864 --> 02:02:14,144
Van

1862
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:15,936
The staff like Matt Walsh's

1863
02:02:16,192 --> 02:02:16,960
Coverage

1864
02:02:17,472 --> 02:02:18,752
No I don't want to choose

1865
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:22,336
I refuse to pay that

1866
02:02:22,592 --> 02:02:24,640
At the end of the day they are on

1867
02:02:24,896 --> 02:02:26,432
Team they all exist in concert

1868
02:02:26,688 --> 02:02:30,016
Yep they're all the same same

1869
02:02:30,272 --> 02:02:31,040
RICO case

1870
02:02:31,296 --> 02:02:32,320
If you will it's just

1871
02:02:32,576 --> 02:02:33,344
It's a

1872
02:02:35,392 --> 02:02:37,184
It's it's baffling to me

1873
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:37,952
That

1874
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:40,256
People would

1875
02:02:41,024 --> 02:02:44,352
Respond to a tragedy by acting in ways

1876
02:02:44,608 --> 02:02:47,168
That serve to make more tragedy more likely

1877
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:50,752
That seems to me to be

1878
02:02:51,008 --> 02:02:52,800
Are you not good way to operate

1879
02:02:53,312 --> 02:02:54,592
And I resent it I find it

1880
02:02:54,848 --> 02:02:55,360
Tubi

1881
02:02:55,616 --> 02:02:56,128
Awful

1882
02:02:56,640 --> 02:02:59,200
I don't like listening to it specially when it's coming from Owen

1883
02:02:59,968 --> 02:03:00,992
On a

1884
02:03:01,248 --> 02:03:02,784
Lighter and less

1885
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:04,576
Serious note

1886
02:03:04,832 --> 02:03:06,624
I think that listening to this much Owen

1887
02:03:07,392 --> 02:03:12,512
Really bums me out until we're saying there was a little bit reassuring inasmuch as like

1888
02:03:12,768 --> 02:03:14,304
Without Alex there ain't no business

1889
02:03:15,584 --> 02:03:16,096
Because like

1890
02:03:16,352 --> 02:03:18,656
You know there's these little

1891
02:03:18,912 --> 02:03:25,056
Flourishes that he thinks are funny like I'm just asking questions

1892
02:03:25,312 --> 02:03:27,360
These are the things that I think

1893
02:03:27,616 --> 02:03:28,640
That he has

1894
02:03:28,896 --> 02:03:31,456
Is he would like to be those idiosyncrasy

1895
02:03:32,736 --> 02:03:34,784
The things we give him for nausea

1896
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:35,808
Today

1897
02:03:36,064 --> 02:03:41,952
Does my character in flares little childish sarcasm thing is supposed to be a character but in fact he's just a whiner

1898
02:03:42,208 --> 02:03:43,232
Yeah

1899
02:03:43,488 --> 02:03:44,000
Yeah

1900
02:03:44,512 --> 02:03:46,816
And it's really really frustrating

1901
02:03:47,072 --> 02:03:48,864
I don't feel like that

1902
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:50,400
That's appealing to an audience

1903
02:03:51,168 --> 02:03:53,984
Bears out in the download numbers

1904
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:56,544
Michelle versus

1905
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:58,080
Horse is Alex's

1906
02:03:58,336 --> 02:03:59,104
That means

1907
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:01,920
It's bad is presentations bad is

1908
02:04:02,432 --> 02:04:02,944
Are we

1909
02:04:03,456 --> 02:04:06,528
What he tries to do this grandstanding I can

1910
02:04:06,784 --> 02:04:09,344
Can find shootings I can play this game all day

1911
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:12,416
Kitty from the lands at B

1912
02:04:12,672 --> 02:04:14,976
I mean it is it is so much

1913
02:04:15,232 --> 02:04:15,744
Just

1914
02:04:16,512 --> 02:04:18,048
Especially in reaction to this

1915
02:04:19,072 --> 02:04:20,096
It is a group

1916
02:04:20,352 --> 02:04:22,400
But people who want money and power

1917
02:04:23,680 --> 02:04:25,472
They just don't care if there's a river of blood

1918
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:28,544
And I'll pretend there isn't that's that's better

1919
02:04:29,056 --> 02:04:32,896
We would like money and power and if there's a river of blood that it takes to get there

1920
02:04:33,152 --> 02:04:33,664
F****** fine

1921
02:04:34,176 --> 02:04:36,480
I'll just pretend that it's everybody else's fault

1922
02:04:36,992 --> 02:04:38,784
I'll just pretend that probably

1923
02:04:39,040 --> 02:04:45,184
Exactly that trail that leads to me

1924
02:04:45,696 --> 02:04:47,232
Probably those people over there

1925
02:04:47,744 --> 02:04:49,536
I know the trail leads to me

1926
02:04:49,792 --> 02:04:52,608
But haven't you read that book about Hansel and Gretel

1927
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:55,424
Baby baby know where they were going

1928
02:04:56,192 --> 02:04:56,704
Sucks

1929
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:57,472
Yep

1930
02:04:57,728 --> 02:05:00,032
I'm sorry to have put this episode

1931
02:05:00,544 --> 02:05:01,568
Together

1932
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:08,224
I guess I did make this episode but it's not my fault that Owen did the thing

1933
02:05:08,992 --> 02:05:10,528
Know this and this is what need

1934
02:05:10,784 --> 02:05:11,296
Needs to be

1935
02:05:11,808 --> 02:05:13,088
Like I didn't know

1936
02:05:13,344 --> 02:05:13,856
Howell

1937
02:05:14,112 --> 02:05:14,880
F****** awful

1938
02:05:15,136 --> 02:05:16,160
The response was

1939
02:05:16,416 --> 02:05:19,232
Cuz I don't I I mean I'm I'm off Twitter I'm off

1940
02:05:19,744 --> 02:05:25,888
All that s*** yeah you mean in the broader media

1941
02:05:26,144 --> 02:05:30,240
I assumed how awful it would be on Infowars but I didn't know how awful it was across

1942
02:05:30,496 --> 02:05:32,544
The land you know and

1943
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:34,336
And to hear this s*** is

1944
02:05:34,592 --> 02:05:35,360
Is Vickery

1945
02:05:35,616 --> 02:05:38,432
Very important to recognize exactly where we are

1946
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:45,344
I am Jaded by Infowars and maybe it's a function of

1947
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:47,136
Owen being there instead of Alex

1948
02:05:47,392 --> 02:05:48,416
But honestly

1949
02:05:48,672 --> 02:05:49,952
I think that there

1950
02:05:50,208 --> 02:05:52,000
Response isn't as bad as

1951
02:05:52,256 --> 02:05:53,280
Like you could have Sue

1952
02:05:53,536 --> 02:05:54,048
Jeff

1953
02:05:54,304 --> 02:05:54,816
David Dunn

1954
02:05:55,584 --> 02:05:56,352
Way more

1955
02:05:56,608 --> 02:05:57,632
Distasteful

1956
02:05:57,888 --> 02:06:00,704
Adrenal amatory copper still pretty inflammatory

1957
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:05,824
Yeah but there is an argument to be made and I'm not positive of it but

1958
02:06:06,592 --> 02:06:07,104
That

1959
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:12,992
Other people were worse than Infowars

1960
02:06:13,248 --> 02:06:14,272
I think that's a result

1961
02:06:14,528 --> 02:06:15,552
Of the Lost

1962
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:20,160
I think that the result of the Judgment I think it's a result of all the times that

1963
02:06:20,672 --> 02:06:24,768
I mean you can see it and how many times he had to sew obliquely

1964
02:06:25,024 --> 02:06:25,536
Be like

1965
02:06:26,048 --> 02:06:27,072
Might have been false

1966
02:06:27,584 --> 02:06:28,096
Get out

1967
02:06:28,352 --> 02:06:30,144
The distance that he'd they had to

1968
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:31,936
Keep from those types of things

1969
02:06:32,192 --> 02:06:38,080
How much further how much is because of the lawsuit and how much of that is because

1970
02:06:38,336 --> 02:06:40,128
Of Owens style you know it's

1971
02:06:40,384 --> 02:06:42,176
Difficult to say because

1972
02:06:42,432 --> 02:06:45,248
Right we don't have as much of a

1973
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:47,552
Vocabulary

1974
02:06:48,064 --> 02:06:48,832
True true

1975
02:06:49,088 --> 02:06:50,880
But yeah if it's

1976
02:06:51,904 --> 02:06:54,720
It feels it feels like maybe it is

1977
02:06:54,976 --> 02:06:55,744
The function of

1978
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,024
Of the lawsuit

1979
02:06:57,280 --> 02:07:03,168
Definitely have more gardens you can see that the lawsuit had an effect

1980
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:07,264
That's for sure, let's take this on just too simple Elementary level

1981
02:07:07,776 --> 02:07:09,056
Alex is conceivably taking

1982
02:07:09,312 --> 02:07:09,824
Time off

1983
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:10,848
Because of

1984
02:07:11,104 --> 02:07:16,992
The after-effects of the lawsuit

1985
02:07:17,248 --> 02:07:19,552
Is at least in some Park

1986
02:07:20,576 --> 02:07:23,136
A consequence of the lawsuits which means Infowars

1987
02:07:23,392 --> 02:07:24,160
His reach is less

1988
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:25,952
So

1989
02:07:27,744 --> 02:07:28,768
This this horrific

1990
02:07:29,024 --> 02:07:29,536
S***

1991
02:07:30,048 --> 02:07:31,328
Reach fewer people

1992
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:33,120
Then if Alex was in studio

1993
02:07:33,632 --> 02:07:34,656
Yeah I guess that's true

1994
02:07:34,912 --> 02:07:41,056
You know I guess that's what we're going for hopefully with a knot

1995
02:07:41,312 --> 02:07:41,824
Is

1996
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:44,896
Horrific maybe something a little lighter but

1997
02:07:45,152 --> 02:07:51,296
We'll see but until then jordan.com

1998
02:07:51,552 --> 02:07:55,136
Flights

1999
02:07:55,392 --> 02:07:56,160
Cool

2000
02:07:57,184 --> 02:07:58,208
I was

2001
02:07:59,232 --> 02:08:00,000
At Monticello

2002
02:08:00,256 --> 02:08:04,352
Monticello from the from TJ's

2003
02:08:07,936 --> 02:08:08,448
Huge

2004
02:08:12,032 --> 02:08:12,800
Ever wrote

2005
02:08:13,056 --> 02:08:13,824
That's like

2006
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:15,616
656 different things

2007
02:08:15,872 --> 02:08:16,896
Through

2008
02:08:17,152 --> 02:08:21,248
The books books actually like lean outwards

2009
02:08:24,064 --> 02:08:25,088
I pulled up on the books

2010
02:08:25,856 --> 02:08:28,672
Turned around the bookshelf yes okay

2011
02:08:28,928 --> 02:08:33,792
And inside I found a manuscript unpublished manuscript written by Thomas Jefferson

2012
02:08:34,304 --> 02:08:34,816
Hear it

2013
02:08:45,824 --> 02:08:46,592
Alex

2014
02:08:47,104 --> 02:08:49,408
In color
