1
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B. I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

2
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
Need MoneyGram

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,064
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Dot-com

5
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,792
Words with the altars saline and talk a little bit about

6
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:10,400
Alex Jones we are Dan

7
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:14,752
You were overeager for that second and I thought you were

8
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:21,152
I heard you say Jordan I thought you were going so fast

9
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:21,920
You know what

10
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:26,528
Start the whole thing over

11
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:31,904
What's up

12
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,952
Well.

13
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:40,352
You know what I'm going to say it I was trying to think of a bright spot that wasn't self-aggrandizing along the way

14
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,632
But I'm going to do it

15
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,936
My brakes bought because it happened

16
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:50,336
I was I was a guest on the god pod review recall

17
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:55,968
Earlier today and they were like everybody said really really nice things about it and I was like you know what

18
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,040
F*** it I am going to accept a compliment

19
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:04,928
I think that was nice it made me feel good today Archangel Michael's reached out and said

20
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:11,328
Great choice really nice to me

21
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:17,728
You had a good appearance I can't have a good or bad episode on our show

22
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:23,104
Because you can enjoy or not enjoy the episode but my job is to just be me

23
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,432
That's true so I can't be like more or less me

24
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:33,088
Sure there is just a baseline levels it is loud and unchanging

25
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:39,232
Nice to be singled out I feel like the belle of the ball

26
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:45,376
Before you you don't sound happy for backhoes trying to think of another angel

27
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,400
Sandalphon

28
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,680
Okay

29
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:54,080
Azazel Azazel demon right

30
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,664
Maybe

31
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,944
Well that's great

32
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,016
My bright spot I guess

33
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,832
Is I was at the store

34
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,904
Ioi

35
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,488
Saw that they sold single slices of pie

36
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,816
Jewel sliced ham slices

37
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,608
The pie

38
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,424
Now it was your bright spot that you just saw you

39
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,824
Could do that night that you followed through I follow through and I ate that

40
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,848
Straight

41
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:30,176
A whole pie is too much

42
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,992
I'm not going to make a pie

43
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,832
I am too busy and lazy to make a pie I'm not going to do it

44
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,880
Supai isn't part of my life

45
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,904
Right much

46
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,720
Pratt and so it was kind of nice

47
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,256
It was a chocolate cream pie

48
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,560
Also I thought was with cheesecake

49
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,096
Cheesecake

50
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,888
Large whipped cheesecake pie

51
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,680
Cheesecake is a pie

52
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:52,960
Don't

53
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:57,568
I don't understand the nomenclature of

54
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:02,176
Pastry cheesecake is a pie Boston cream pie as a cake

55
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,200
Move forward

56
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:10,112
I've had this argument too many times in my life and I don't have patience for it

57
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:23,167
It's better than those like microwavable pies you see it like 7:11 or something

58
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,215
So I would hope so

59
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,495
Much better

60
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,591
Just weak breakbot on my part

61
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:36,991
Weak bright spots today we have an episode

62
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,807
Okay on that but before we do

63
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:46,463
Say little mama to say hello to some new walks

64
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,231
Ewok

65
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:53,631
Next Little Debbie for me

66
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,679
Capital

67
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:02,079
Thank you very much next secretary of defense Steve pieczenik thank you so much you are now a policy wonk

68
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:08,479
Thank you very much thank you so much

69
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:14,879
Thank you very much next time Jed and I'm half man half bear half pig

70
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:18,207
9% walk the math checks out

71
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:24,863
Happened on September 16th 1999

72
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,631
Policy wonk

73
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:33,311
Thank you very much I do next to I love my nugget more than anything in the universe and I guess my

74
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,127
Stinky hawk-boy to thank you

75
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:41,247
Thank you very much I feel like those last two had to have been connect you know nothing happened onto

76
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:46,367
September 16th 1999 and then I love my hog boy I feel like we'd know

77
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,695
I'm guessing that that was like

78
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,975
A birthday

79
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:57,375
I'm hoping I feel like that's what we're discovering

80
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:00,191
What happened on September 16th 1999

81
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,239
On onthisday.com

82
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,775
Dolly the sheep

83
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:07,615
14.8 in of rainfall

84
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,175
Hit Myrtle Beach from Hurricane Floyd

85
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,711
So that's one thing alright

86
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,087
The Netherlands started their first season ever

87
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,647
Of the Big Brother show Big Brother

88
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,415
Alright

89
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,463
I've never seen Dutch Big Brother

90
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,999
Have you seen American big boy

91
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,095
I think they they cook

92
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,887
Big Brother longer in

93
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,447
In the slow cooker

94
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:39,359
Yeah I don't like that chill and care for it find a voyeuristic and weird

95
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
Jordan

96
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:40,895
Yes Dan

97
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:47,295
For a long time I've been of the mind that there is a type of right-wing figure that I feel drawn to cover and it typed that I don't want to

98
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,343
Use my limited amount of time Focus

99
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,111
Kissing on

100
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:56,511
Some of the folks in that second category or there because I feel like other people are competently covering them and their

101
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:00,351
Maybe little more that I could add to the conversation if we did engage

102
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:04,959
For example I think that Dave Rubin is a subject that I don't really want to cover because

103
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,263
You get some good mockery from Sam Cedar

104
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,871
Hanging Tempah on toast made an incredible in-depth takedown of his rhetorical techniques

105
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,919
And the show itself which you can find on YouTube

106
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:19,551
Covering his actual show would likely just involved me repeating critiques that are already well-articulated

107
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,159
You're not adding anything to the space yeah

108
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:28,255
I know I know what I can and can't do I don't think there's more to add there

109
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,535
Others are in the

110
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,607
That category because I feel like their primary game involves

111
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,375
Comedy

112
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,143
Joe Rogan

113
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:40,543
Generally falls into this category and I can probably cover any episode of his show for our podcast but it would end up drifting into

114
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:45,151
The territory where we would just be over-analyzing idiots making edgy offensive jokes

115
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:50,271
These are the sort of figures that I might cover but it's kind of a case-by-case situation

116
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:54,111
Yeah I think the concern for us is eventually we just wind up doing punch up

117
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,391
You know we're like

118
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,159
Oh that's

119
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:02,559
I get where you're trying to go that here's where that joke would be better as it if you're trying to be offensive the joke doesn't work

120
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,655
Work because of blank

121
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:13,055
And then there are figures that I don't cover because they're basically troll attention Chasers there any real Merit past that point

122
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:19,967
Steven Crowder is one of these folks Tim pool is also someone who I would include in that category

123
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,039
Remember people suggest that we cover pool in the past

124
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,343
I don't want to do because he sucks

125
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,623
Really hard and

126
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,463
I don't even feel like taking him seriously is worth the time I feel like he is

127
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:39,167
Clout Chaser is eat at the overused term

128
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:44,287
He's got a billboard on the way to Midway I saw a billboard for this dude saying he's not relevan

129
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,079
Here's what it is

130
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:49,663
A he's nothing until he changes his name to cooler with Pooler

131
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,759
Until that happens

132
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,831
Tool Time Pool Time

133
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,647
The new home improvement

134
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:05,279
Reboot Home Improvement

135
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:08,863
Punch up there we go. It's just never not going to happen

136
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,703
I believe that the time has come for me to change how I approach these things

137
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:19,871
I'm not going to abandon focusing on Alex don't get to that impression in her head but I feel a calling to Branch out a little bit

138
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:26,271
It Morris growing in our country and other people who are Alex adjacent could probably use a bit more of

139
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,319
The focused attention that we use

140
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:32,927
To help bring a larger understanding of what they're all about and how they misinformed

141
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,975
The audiences for similar purposes

142
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,511
Inspector Infowars.

143
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,791
Oh yeah

144
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,351
Today we're going to be embarking on a little bit of that

145
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,167
So now it better not be Tim pool is it Tim pool

146
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,519
Well here's the thing god dammit I have a goal in mind

147
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,055
I had an intention

148
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:53,663
Sure and then we recording this on Tuesday and last night

149
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,271
Something happened on Tim pool show

150
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:04,159
Acquired a little bit of attention

151
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:09,023
Some of the thoughts that I already had kicked around my about absolutely not

152
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:10,815
Okay

153
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,863
That's it that's great

154
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:23,103
Are we back to the beginning I have I finally completely unaware of what's about to happen you didn't

155
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,151
You didn't hear about his show

156
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:29,247
No I don't give a s*** about Tim pool what part of

157
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:34,367
Cooler with polar didn't you understand I ignore anything I would do it with this b*******

158
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,159

Call my God Kanye

164
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,543
Continue to cycle which is now going on for over a week which is

165
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,079
In many ways unheard-of

166
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,103
The right now

167
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,407
Because Donald Trump went to dinner

168
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,175
With ye

169

Nick Fuentes

170

Saturday is now being denounced by

171
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,527
Mike Pence

172
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,319
Several Republican Senators

173
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,343
And

174
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,671
For whatever reason this story for many reasons opposed

175
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
People have made

176
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,463

And we are able to actually sit down with

179
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,375
Several of the individuals involved

180
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,911
In that story notably Yanik

181
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:19,935
Cousin

182
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,703
Of course you may.

183
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,727
Happen

184
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,263
Minecraft

185
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,055
I have to do

186
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,103
My bad my bad

187
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:27,871
There you go

188
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:34,527
Pretty cute that Tim is pretending to not understand why it's a completely f*****-up thing for the former president and candid

189
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:38,623
Navigate to to be president again is having a meeting with these kinds of f***** up figures

190
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,951
I guess he's been away from the spotlight for long enough people

191
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:45,535
Just forget what an embarrassing loser Milo is but here he is

192
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:52,191
I wonder how he feels about his books title now that his brand is that he's a former homosexual

193
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,751
Leaving that nonsense aside

194
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:59,871
Even when he was at rolling game August game guy Milo was a Catholic fascist

195
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,175
He said as much in an interview with Nick Fuentes

196
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,247
Years back and his views haven't gotten better over time

197
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:12,159
In the most generous description a literal white identity extremist who has a history of

198
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,231
Augustine Island spreading AP synthetic conspiracy theories

199
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,511
He attended the

200
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:21,375
Unite the right rally in 2017 when he was just 18 marching side-by-side with Nazi

201
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,959
Is chanting blood and soil at Jews won't replace us

202
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,775
And then we've seen what's happened with Yaya lately

203
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,311
He's having a very intense

204
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:35,711
Public meltdown and he's fallen in with Puentes and Milo it which I guess is forming the Brain Trust

205
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,527
24 presidential campaign

206
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:42,111
There may be a mental health component to this but ultimately

207
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:47,487
I'm not in the business of infantilizing yay and he's under the space where manic episode or not

208
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,279
He what he's doing is going to get people kill

209
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,911
Yang is one of the biggest rappers of past couple decades and is a gigantic fan

210
00:12:55,167 --> 00:13:01,311
When he does something like endorse Nick 20s or Milo and publicly associate with them and take them along

211
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,335
Long to meet with Trump

212
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,639
That sends a message to his fans

213
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:11,039
It's really depressing to imagine the number of people who would never have heard of Nick left for this Association

214
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,831
That's a real impact

215
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,159
Yeah you know what I was wondering about

216
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,439
I was wondering

217
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:20,255
About whether or not this actually makes sense

218
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,303
44 intestine Milo

219
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:26,911
Because I think everybody on the surface level is like

220
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,727
Them famous person obviously

221
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:34,079
But I had it I mean it just doesn't make sense they're all white nationalist

222
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:37,663
The only people who like yay now or conservatives

223
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:43,295
And it's not like ye was already selling s*** tons of albums to conservatives in all of his fans were there

224
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,343
I kind of think this blows back

225
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,671
Badly on Fuentes and Milo more than a dozen

226
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:53,791
How can I see a white nationalist if you're literally writing Kanye's go tail

227
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:57,631
Well I think that there is an element of this visit

228
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,423
You think about it as we go along

229
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,703
As we go along

230
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,751
Consider this

231
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,055
I thought that you're having because I think

232
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,591
I think they're Tactical

233
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:10,943
Ames and things that are a little bit deeper below the surface

234
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:17,343
And maybe two or three stages removed from the immediate

235
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,159
Sing any of them they can all go f*** themselves and then white who gives a f***

236
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:25,279
S*** about why don't I don't think anybody assumed that you were

237
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,071
But I'm just I'm just saying

238
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,119
I don't think that

239
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,399
I kind of

240
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,191
Have a hard time believing

241
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,239
That there are

242
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,263
Ye fan

243
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,079
Who are looking at ya

244
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,359
Current behavior

245
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,687
Like he made them fans when he was good at music

246
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,503
Right and now he's bad at music and they're looking at it

247
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,783
Whisker Behavior thinking

248
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,575
I want to emulate this

249
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,111
He's doing a bad

250
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,391
Job at the thing

251
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,951
Only conservatives are liking

252
00:14:54,207 --> 00:15:00,351
Yay now and conservatives hate black people so I don't think it's going to help me with Nick

253
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:04,703
I think they might be booked on this why I think your assessment of celebrity is a little bit

254
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,799
I could be way wrong on that on account of I don't understand that even the slightest

255
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,871
I think that his fans have not all abandoned

256
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:18,271
That you're maybe a lot of

257
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:24,671
People think that it's slipped off a little bit but I don't think that is you know there is The Exodus of all of his fans in the way

258
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,695
Whether you're imagining

259
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:32,095
Second I think even if there is a evolution of the fanbase let's say there is still

260
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,143
A massive celebrity

261
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,191
Right and that's something that

262
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,983
Needs to be factored in

263
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:42,335
Jersey Star Quality and Beyond there is a

264
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,639
Ovid

265
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,175
Not pay attention

266
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,735
Because of a super famous

267
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,319
So I've said this many times and I'm going to say it again

268
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:57,439
Nick is a little bit of a scam type character but he's not like the other people that we cover

269
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,975
He is an idea log

270
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,255
He is a gifted Spa

271
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:06,655
He's an attractive young man and he studied in high school which is developed in him the ability to sound convincing

272
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,447
People who aren't listening to him critically

273
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:11,007
Even if what he's saying is complete b*******

274
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,591
He understands the optical value of appearance over substance

275
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:19,455
By the time I realize he's wrong about something he's already onto the next point

276
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,223
That's

277
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:26,623
Pretty typical who got stuck in high school and

278
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,647
Now he's a white National

279
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,951
Nick is involved in a political project

280
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:32,255
He's using ye to push that further

281
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:38,911
That project involves many important goals like the removal of immigrants from the country to hardening of our borders and a require

282
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,191
Argument that people in government

283
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:40,959
Be Christian

284
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:47,615
Milo on his own is a complete embarrassment and loser who's relegated to Christian QVC type appearances

285
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,407
On his own he's meaningless

286
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,687
But he's not on his own

287
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,247
He's apparently still a decent networker

288
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:59,647
And through him the combination of yay and Nick is now connected to Marjorie Taylor Greene

289
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,439
Was recently in a two-parent light

290
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:05,023
Who knows what other connection the Milo does or doesn't have

291
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:09,375
He's the sort of s*** head who no one wanted to associate with publicly

292
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,143
After

293
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,703
You know that old Rogan thing and then

294
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:19,103
Delia's pretty great that doesn't mean that he doesn't have connections behind the scene

295
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,151
It's like all manner of weird friend

296
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,479
Creeps still stayed in contact with him he might have

297
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:30,879
The pretty relevant I mean let's not forget that he's only a few years removed from receiving Mercer money

298
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,159
So it's not like

299
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:38,559
It's not like they would be like all your Burns forever and I posted being like Oh lay low for a few years and then we'll catch up

300
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:43,935
Backup do nose if they're still a connection with

301
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:49,567
This Trio was interesting as a group because they all have things that the others in need

302
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:55,711
Yay is famous as s*** and he's a lightning rod for attention but has no real experience in the political space

303
00:17:56,479 --> 00:18:02,367
Milo has that experience and connections but he's become a bit of a laughing stock that nobody is really going to take Serious

304
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:09,279
Nikki's Savvy and media ready but no one really wants to associate with him because his Public Image is that he's a nut

305
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,839
Who's at the United right rally on January 6th

306
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,631
But people can't ignore him

307
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,679
If he's attached to someone like yay

308
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:22,335
And the thing they all have in common is Christian fascist ideology

309
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:28,735
Cific about their desire for Catholic fascism but I think he has yet to make his preferences fully known but he's been very clear

310
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,759
About

311
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,807
Basically a Theocratic

312
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:35,135
System yeah but I mean f******

313
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:39,231
Who cares what he has to say I'm Blown Away by it

314
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,023
You know like

315
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:46,143
I care about all the evil shity as to say that causing damage or I don't give a s*** what he

316
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,423
Minks might work

317
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:51,007
Why the f*** would I care what he thinks of good government would be

318
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,847
All I care about is he's an anti-semitic piece of s*** now and we got to stop

319
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,127
For that s*** you know

320
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,407
I guess

321
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:02,015
I don't think I was saying we're going to discuss policy

322
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:07,647
Prescriptions okay

323
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:11,999
That's the other thing that they have in common though they bring up is that they have pretty

324
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,023
F***** up and

325
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,863
Reviews about hating to Apple

326
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,727
Little insincere for Tim pool to pretend that it's weird that this meeting was in the news

327
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:28,383
The former president and the candidate for the next election was meeting with a trio of Christian fascist ideologues who have a rich history of Auntie

328
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,151
Semitism

329
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:33,503
What for whatever reason this was in that this is stayed in the news

330
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:38,367
It's a ridiculous thing to have happened so weird right I see everybody

331
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:43,743
Play talking about a totally an Oculus meeting between a former musical genius

332
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:50,143
I incredibly weird loser fascist white dude and his incredibly weird loser fastest way to Fresh

333
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,167
And

334
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:55,007
Performers incredibly weird white dude fashion president

335
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,311
But the weird thing it some

336
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,847
Yeah it's understandable

337
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,383
Anyway

338
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:04,223
Tim has all three of those dudes

339
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,503
Of course

340
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:11,135
Can't believe you about this can't believe you didn't hear about this

341
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,159
Why

342
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,719
Alright alright

343
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:18,303
You know it's not a very big story

344
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,351
A lot of people have questions about

345
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:23,167
You know what were Trump's intentions why were certain people invited

346
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,191
Entropic courses

347
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:27,007
Statements so a lot of people want to know where he stands

348
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:27,775
And more importantly

349
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,311
What happened there

350
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,335
And why

351
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,383
And there's also the questions about

352
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,919
What ye 24 mean

353
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,711
And I'll keep that little bit because they can answer to

354
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,039
More to that

355
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,063
Is however

356
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,927
Head over to timcast, become a member and have a members-only uncensored show

357
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:49,023
Which will probably get a bit more in-depth on a lot of other issues

358
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,119
Becoming a support at work

359
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,655
And we'll talk about more there

360
00:20:54,911 --> 00:21:00,543
I might be reading a little bit into things but it's my sense that Tim is trying to get people to go sign up for the website

361
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:06,431
To get the bonus members-only video with the implication that this was where there's going to be a conversation about the Jews stuff

362
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,223
Jo-Ann's where that was going to die

363
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:14,623
If you listen to this episode you get the sense that Tim had a structure in mind of how this was going to go where they would talk about the trumpet

364
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:21,024
Dinner and he would Pat himself on the back for being a great journalist and getting these primary sources in there

365
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,584
Anti-Semitism stuff later in a way that he could back

366
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,864
Mises benefit from

367
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,656
People will know busy

368
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:33,056
And you don't want to give away the main event on free TV to use wrestling lingo you're trying to move the pay-per-view Buy

369
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:38,432
You don't want to have the big Feud the big the big he'll get right up by the face

370
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:44,832
It's interesting how that works considering like you you never saw HBO.

371
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:48,928
Do like nine episodes of Game of Thrones and then like season finale

372
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:54,304
You got to pay extra for it bro you know like that's that's an interesting model that somehow works

373
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:58,144
I mean that is still just like

374
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,168
Subscription

375
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:05,312
I'm already paying for all Valley or whatever

376
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,176
FairPoint

377
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:14,016
You still got to get a ticket to the movie

378
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:16,064
The movie The X-Files

379
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,600
Many many years later

380
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:24,512
I don't know fortunately they almost immediately starts rambling tangential thoughts and gets in

381
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:30,144
Sent to his feelings about Jews really early in the interview and Nick and Milo fully have his back

382
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:34,496
Tim Flanders a little bit and then spoiler alert yeh storms out

383
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,544
Leverage point

384
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:40,640
Shipley Do-Nut near about that

385
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:46,784
It's a lot of people were talking about it last night because they stormed out

386
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,856
Twitter I'm off of all social medias

387
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,648
Out in the wilderness

388
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:59,584
So after that happens to his Groove co-host sit around and talk about how well Tim handled himself and how he ate people who some

389
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,864
Ascribed identity politics

390
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,144
Because I guess that's how

391
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,704
Tim decided to avoid saying anti-semitism

392
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,312
This is the long and short of what happens but will go through a little bit more of this because

393
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,872
Really interesting to see how these Dynamics play out

394
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,920
In action like in Toronto

395
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:16,224
Yeah I mean look

396
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,016
Faint praise perhaps

397
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:24,416
But I think Nick comes off great cuz he didn't say s*** basically

398
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:30,816
He's move Milo is eager to say things on the backbench for way too long getting his fur

399
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,376
First taste of coverage again.

400
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,680
My sense of it I don't think that

401
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,448
Nick like

402
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,728
Tim pool March

403
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:44,128
Just as a whole is f****** reasons he's also certainly in other context

404
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:50,528
Not welcome on the ship like what what are we talkin about

405
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:56,672
I don't think Tim or Nick is unaware that each other is aware of that

406
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:00,768
Very obvious feeling of like

407
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,840
The Ayatollah and

408
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,144
Conservative like a

409
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,472
Prosperity Gospel Pastor got together

410
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,496
They be like listen

411
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:16,384
I don't agree with you and I want you to die but actually everything we want the world to be as pretty much identical

412
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,176
Also

413
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:21,504
Apparently not cuz I'm just goes about 20 minutes

414
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,368
Anyway he hasn't co-host Tim does this blew my mind

415
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,392
Luthier

416
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:32,000
Total sausage fest tonight welcome my name is looking to ask you if we are change

417
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,304
Start work today I'm wearing my Epstein

418
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,072
Didn't

419
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,888
Seeing himself t-shirt

420
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:44,544
Woodstock, I think we should be using that word a little bit more just like you know this YouTube channel didn't Epstein itself

421
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:48,640
And if this YouTube channel is Epstein we will be streaming on

422
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,408
Twitter

423
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:54,272
So yeah I started the t-shirt company after YouTube demonetized me so the best political shirts

424
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,552
Stop, because you guys bye

425
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,320
That's why I'm here

426
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,088
Thank you so much

427
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,880
Why didn't you say that YouTube Epstein

428
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:06,816
This is fine because there is this pre-emptive thing of like oh this is so dangerous YouTube's going to take this

429
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:11,424
Down as it's going on or whatever

430
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,704
But this is nuts

431
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,080
Maybe I haven't paid him enough attention but no idea that Luke radowski was one of his co-host

432
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:22,944
It's pretty hilarious for Tim to try and take some kind of a Centrist neutral position when Luke

433
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,712
Is a co-op

434
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,624
Luke radowski is an old-time Alex Jones associate in a big-time 911 guy from way back

435
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,696
We are change was a group that was formed to for 9/11

436
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:37,024
Conspiracy shirt and to push Ron Paul

437
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,304
Yeah pretty Centrist.

438
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:44,704
Yeah I know that some somewhat left-leaning people were suckered into supporting rampal because of his opposition to Warren support for Wii

439
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,472
Weed but

440
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:51,872
People who are starting organizations to promote him weren't that naive about how extremely far to the right is actually

441
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,896
Politics work

442
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,944
I find that to be

443
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:01,344
Level of naivety that I'm not willing to accept

444
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:07,744
Jersey bulshit either like he's prominently featured in the 2009 documentary newworldorder alongside Alex Jones

445
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,840
And he's drunk Bilderberg obsessed holocaust-denying friend Jim Tucker

446
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:18,752
Honestly there's a bad look for pool with this whole game but trying to play like he's in the center and he's a really critical thinking type media

447
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,520
You figure

448
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:24,384
Appalling around with 9/11 conspiracy theorist Alex Jones cast-offs

449
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,784
Maybe a bad luck that what he's supposed to be trying to do is that what people ran

450
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:37,184
That's wild I think maybe people who like him but I don't think I don't think anybody who

451
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,744
Would look at this with a critical I would come away with that

452
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,560
I think I think here's my

453
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:48,448
Quick and dirty I'm sorry I don't remember how like Dave Rubin was like

454
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:54,848
I am believing the last time the last time my goddamn Pearl

455
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:57,920
Really powerful I think for people who want to push

456
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:02,016
Right-wing ideas but try and avoid any kind of the

457
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,040
Bike

458
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,064
I don't know

459
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,184
Negative associations that come along with with that I think Tim is kind of in a similar milia

460
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,304
Wild because I've never seen anybody be like hey Tim pool without also being a ship

461
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,584
S******* you know

462
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,632
Like it's 1121

463
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:22,752
Young. One ever regular a snot s*** head person has ever been like

464
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:28,640
Some good idea you don't hang out in bad enough circles here probably right I'm sorry I interrupted

465
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:35,296
Already forgotten alright let's do it remembered it or I would be a different person

466
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,344
Shock

467
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,672
Trio came together

468
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:47,072
And

469
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,632
The reasons why I like what I was listening to it I was like wow

470
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,424
Not talk about this

471
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,472
I just want to start off by

472
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,264
How did this dinner come to happen

473
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,408
I was talking to

474
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,688
For about

475
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,968
A month with schedule.

476
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,016
And October

477
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,552
Sounds for president

478
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,600
Turn back to Nova

479
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,184
And

480
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,000
I've been pulling together a campaign

481
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,280
And after I put up

482
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,048
The

483
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,328
The Defcon

484
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,632
A bunch

485
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,656
People that have been

486
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,192
Cancel Buy

487
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,472
Alex Jones

488
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,008
Started getting contact with other

489
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,288
Full that we're now on the

490
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,080
You know the inside of the maze

491
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,128
And

492
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,408
Alex Jones

493
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,456
Producer said that Milo

494
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,736
Wanted to contact

495
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,016
And

496
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:39,808
Here we are

497
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:46,208
Interesting cuz I think that reveals a few things the first is that Milo is still in contact with Al

498
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:49,792
What does producer in on good enough terms that he can send messages through them

499
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:56,192
This could be Daria I suppose but it could also be one of the other figures around in fours like Rob do or the

500
00:28:56,448 --> 00:29:01,568
The IT guy Michael Zimmerman who has a bunch of connections to really extreme Fringe figures

501
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,848
So that could be

502
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:09,248
I took the natural person he would call the produce

503
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:12,064
Email to email bases with Kanye

504
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,112
I just don't even know what the world is ending

505
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,136
Anymore you know

506
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,672
Like I just don't

507
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:23,072
I I don't know but I know who it is but that's a pretty interesting thing has him.

508
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:29,472
Beats at I think honestly that's my issue with too much of this Rob do isn't a band

509
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:35,872
The problem I have with Kanye and Milo and Nick Fuentes aside from all their views is

510
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:36,640
Is just like

511
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:40,992
What the f*** do you talk about when you're not being anti-semitic you know like

512
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,040
What UConn you can't be like

513
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,576
I know you think

514
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:48,416
That you want to go with 110 but if you go with 105 beats per minute

515
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:54,560
It's going to give you a little extra idiosyncrasies that's going to bring out some a special juice you know that's not going to happen

516
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:57,120
Yeah and the next to talk about Chicago

517
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,144
That's where

518
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,192
So there's that

519
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:01,728
I don't know

520
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,288
Whoever it was at Infowars

521
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:10,688
They saw the Tweet where ye said that he was going to go desk on Freon the Jews and they knew that this was exactly what the

522
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,712
They have been waiting for

523
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:18,368
Big huge celebrity ruining their Public Image in a way that it would be in our they be relegated to hang out with dip shitz like Milo hand

524
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:25,024
Like all signed go the dream scenario

525
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,328
Ha TA by one of Alex's producers

526
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,352
Wild

527
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:35,008
Another interesting thing and that is that Alex's producer has been in touch with ye and ye hasn't come on

528
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:35,776
On the show yet

529
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,824
That has to be a choice

530
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:44,224
To point towards my theory that Alex actually doesn't want to have ye on because of the possibility of eggs

531
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,272
Exactly how this Tim pool interview went

532
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,856
You like about this interview no one comes out looking good

533
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:56,768
Milo naked ye already look like s*** so it's a push for them but Tim really looks like a complete Craven dick

534
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,816
Engaging in this interview for attention

535
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,608
Being so ineffectual

536
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:01,888
I got to say though

537
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:07,008
He's not so ineffectual once they storm out because at that point he's trying to self-soothe

538
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:13,408
Now he's already a big boy now

539
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,176
What a f******

540
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:20,576
Yeah so we got an Infowars connection like immediately it's bananas

541
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,368
To this team coming together

542
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:25,184
I am really really annoyed

543
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:31,328
And you know like it hits me in waves every couple of months or so it's like man

544
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:35,680
We started a show about some assholes who wasn't that important

545
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:38,496
Yeah no here we are

546
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,776
Like this is Stu

547
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,824
Now here we are

548
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,616
All this weird bulshit

549
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:50,016
Recording this just hours after Stewart Roads got found guilty of seditious conspiracy

550
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:56,416
Joe Biggs is also on trial for that have all of our opening-season care

551
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,720
Characters go to jail in season 5

552
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:01,024
What we need to know I think that

553
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,728
Tucked up.

554
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:12,032
So anyway that's how

555
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,080
Milo and ye came together

556
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:14,848
And then

557
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,128
So that's how you guys got

558
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:23,808
Bringing

559
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,880
Inova Dexter

560
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,416
Brain Firepower

561
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,304
Any

562
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,096
Prodigious

563
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,680
And

564
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:41,728
Pretty much

565
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,288
Yeah one of the greatest

566
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:47,360
Political commentators of his generation

567
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:51,456
I think this guy just I think he doesn't know what he's doing

568
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:54,528
I think Nick is really wrong on this one

569
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,808
I think he's left

570
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:56,832
10 to fast

571
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,112
He is going

572
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:00,672
Two Become One of Kanye's losers

573
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:07,328
I don't like it's another one in Kanye's loser I think that there's a possibility for that but I also think that

574
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,632
There's

575
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,960
I I think there's a possibility that Nikki

576
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:17,056
Engage in this kind of stuff and engage fairly unscathed

577
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,080
Cuz I think

578
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:24,736
That he is smart enough to let Milo get embarrassed

579
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,528
And he may have it I'm just saying that

580
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:30,624
The more likely scenario is the young kid

581
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,160
Gets in over his head

582
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:38,048
And get eaten alive by the by the game that's the story we've heard look at mix career

583
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,584
I mean he went up against

584
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,936
Turning Point USA

585
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:47,264
Currently diminished in their capacity

586
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:51,360
Well I mean

587
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:56,992
I also think they've been o times when you would have thought like this isn't Caldwell

588
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:03,904
There's there's a possibility for coming out the other end better for it

589
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,208
Even if everything is a disaster

590
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:11,328
Tim really wants to talk about the going to dinner

591
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,888
Thing that's really what he's interested in

592
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,424
Yay is not

593
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,728
So this how you get in contact

594
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:18,496
The three of you

595
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,032
How is it that

596
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:22,080
Nick and invited this dinner

597
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,360
And and what hap

598
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,408
Will he

599
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,456
He was rolling with me I was impressed

600
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,224
With Nick and I was

601
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:28,992
Was like

602
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,528
Just come to the dinner

603
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,064
And we had

604
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,624
Pick us up

605
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,648
From the airport

606
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:41,280
And there was a lot of back-and-forth there's another gentleman named Jamar Montgomery that was with us

607
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,120
He's an engineer at Boeing

608
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,400
And his

609
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,448
Antagonist

610
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:49,984
Would you rather Roselia

611
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,752
OK Google

612
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:54,336
And we sat there and it was like when Trump came in

613
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,616
We were

614
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,176
I said you want to sit alone he's like no

615
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,456
Bring your friends in so

616
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:02,272
A big thing is like Trump had no idea who

617
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,296
Puentes

618
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:04,576
Was

619
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,624
And but this whole I just

620
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,416
I just got to go right

621
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,696
To the heart

622
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,720
Of this

623
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,768
Anti-semite

624
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,048
Claim that's happening

625
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:17,120
This is something if you read the definition

626
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:18,912
It

627
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,192
It says you can't

628
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:20,960
Claim

629
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:21,984
That

630
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,824
There's multiple people inside a bank

631
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,872
Or in Media

632
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,408
That

633
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,688
Are all Jewish

634
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:34,016
Or you're anti-Semitic

635
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:34,784
The truth

636
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,064
Bike

637
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,112
It's the truth what we talkin about end

638
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:39,904
What library

639
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:40,928
You mean

640
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,232
I'm saying like

641
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:45,536
I've been labeled anti-semite

642
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,304
Okay

643
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,144
Finishing thoughts

644
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,544
It's cute that he's trying to play a game where he has some definition he's decided to use for antisemitism so we can pretend it's

645
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,592
Observe for him to be labeled as such a thing

646
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:04,992
That's dumb and I don't really want to take the time to keep her that s*** but this is important because I think you can see Tim's useless

647
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,392
He's trying to ask a question about the dinner and very much doesn't want the anti-Semitism talk to come this early

648
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:16,256
It's too volatile of topic and that's going to if that's going to come at all

649
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:18,048
Bees into a little bit

650
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:24,704
Yay on the other hand is all too eager to talk about his feelings about Jewish people at anytime when someone

651
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,776
I'm proud of him and because Tim can't control the conversation at all

652
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,056
This is where we are

653
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:32,640
There's no way to control this conversation

654
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:38,016
Yeah isn't interested in playing Tim pools games because he's super famous and he doesn't give a s*** about

655
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:40,064
Tim's crypto extremist audience

656
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,856
He's already passed that

657
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,392
He's already extreme

658
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:48,256
You hang out with Nick and Milo and if anything they were doing Tim a favor by showing up

659
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,816
I know the pool shows big and all but

660
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,096
It's not yay level

661
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:58,496
There's no way to control this conversation because he doesn't give a s*** and even if he kind of gave a s*** he has to be

662
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:04,128
Bigot friends there to embolden him and egg him on so honestly if I were Tim I never would have done a show like this

663
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:07,968
It's great for getting attention but the consequences are really bad

664
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:15,392
Even leaving aside how bad it is for the public discourse to have you this gas line up on the show it's really bad for Tim

665
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:22,048
He comes off looking like a really limp noodle and because they left with yay Nick and Milo kind of have achieved

666
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:24,352
Something of an elevated status over to him

667
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,632
Because get this

668
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:29,216
Without my loaf there's no way ye was showing up on pool show

669
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:33,056
From the perspective of Milo and presumably nikken ye to

670
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,080
F*** this up

671
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,640
Yeah I'm f***** up an opportunity for himself

672
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:42,784
And what Jay gets into this antisemitism defensive himself all Tim can really monster is what library

673
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:49,184
As if his goal was to challenge the source of yazz definition ridiculous and it's a real bottle that isn't design

674
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,208
Time to go anywhere

675
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,744
Designed to

676
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,048
It's it's

677
00:37:54,304 --> 00:38:00,448
Performative pushback more than it is actual engagement with anything that's being said and that's kind of the game

678
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:02,752
Yeah I haven't seen an Entourage

679
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:03,776
Is this toxic

680
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:04,800
Elvis

681
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,848
So we all know that means

682
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:09,152
Yeah is going to die on the toilet of an impact

683
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:15,808
I thought you were going to say Britney Spears with her group of stewardesses on that video taking advantage

684
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,576
Just Brittany

685
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:25,024
The song music video I don't know if I've ever seen the music video. I believe she's on a plane at some point

686
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,304
Air Force 1

687
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:31,936
I think they were trying to trap people for improv show

688
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,216
So

689
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:39,616
I got to be honest with you there's a boob sound in this next clip and that's because

690
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:43,200
I thought that this video would be taken down

691
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:46,272
Like

692
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:48,320
So I was recording it live

693
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:54,208
And I was also downloading some files I believe like some Alex Jones episodes

694
00:38:54,464 --> 00:39:00,608
And so my computer made a beep noise going to file rat download

695
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,400
So you'll hear that

696
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,680
As a warning

697
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,984
There's a boo what you going to do

698
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:06,752
Anyway

699
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,800
Gave going in on his thing

700
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,104
And in general

701
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,128
America

702
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:13,664
Has been

703
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:16,224
Left ignorant and history has been changed

704
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,784
So we start questioning things

705
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,576
That question

706
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,112
The indoctrination

707
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,928
Then you immediately

708
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:25,696
Get

709
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,488
Vino

710
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,024
You said

711
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,840
Dabangg 3 Rd what did you say happened to you or

712
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:35,936
Demonetized a platform DEA demonize demonetized

713
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:39,008
And what's so beautiful about this time

714
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,288
Is

715
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,104
Everyone got to see

716
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,664
What's really been happening

717
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:50,016
And now we can really understand we can see that

718
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:54,368
Ronnie Manuel was right next to Obama and then Jared Kushner

719
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,648
Was right next

720
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,672
Trump

721
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:04,864
Search for the news

722
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,936
I think I think the issue is

723
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:08,960
One way to put it

724
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:12,032
Is your ex pounding Upon A localization

725
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:16,896
Let me clarify there are a handful of people that you see are Jewish

726
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:17,664
In a certain place

727
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,200
And then you associate Judaism

728
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,480
With the power

729
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,040
What would I view that as not relevan

730
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:26,368
Yeah you're substantially more powerful than I am but I don't

731
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,648
I'll give you what you're doing

732
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,416
As an issue of

733
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,000
Yeah but

734
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,280
Have you ever heard the term

735
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,816
The black vote

736
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,376
So it's okay to put us in one net

737
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,424
But it's not okay for me to put them in one

738
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,960
Yeah but I mean

739
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,496
That's the basis of the hip-hop

740
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,032
RC that people have been

741
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:44,800
Been thinking about

742
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,848
And knowing about and realizing

743
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:47,616
For decades

744
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,640
We were all Wonder

745
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,176
What is damn wormtown

746
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,456
Everybody in the car

747
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,504
What is the route

748
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,440
Rashidun Wicked and

749
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:03,232
Oppressive prevailing Orthodoxy

750
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:09,632
Ulta cancelculture Twilight send out that the one thing was going to break the dam has the biggest dog in the world and it took the biggest on the wall to do it

751
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:12,704
And now the damn is broken

752
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:19,360
So we see here the Tim does not have the tools that are needed to make any argument in this Arena

753
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:23,200
Tim The Tool less man to her this pool is empty

754
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:29,600
Kimberly wants to call yea's anti-semitic ideas anything but anti-semitic so he's trying to go with quotes

755
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:31,136
Localization issue

756
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,416
Rahm Emanuel

757
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:37,024
Was Jewish and work for Obama and Jared Kushner is doing

758
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:41,120
Localization issue that's grasping at anti-semitic straws

759
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,448
How does this Theory even work

760
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,984
If you're going to take it seriously

761
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,592
No one wanted Jared to have any official role that he wouldn't have if he wasn't Trump's son-in-law

762
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,616
It wasn't a Jewish

763
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:52,895
She was an epic

764
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:53,663
Empire

765
00:41:53,919 --> 00:42:00,063
And what about the fact it ROM was Obama's Chief of Staff from the time of his election until October 2010 when

766
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,599
When you ran for Chicago mayor

767
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:07,999
He was only in that position for like a year-and-a-half and then was replaced by Bill Daley relative of former Chicago mayor Richard Daley

768
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,279
Who isn't Jewish

769
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:14,655
But I do know daily was replaced by Jack Lew who is Jewish and was the chief of staff for about a year

770
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:18,751
And then he was replaced by Dennis Montague who is a Irish Catholic

771
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,799
Google localization issue

772
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:23,615
That's a euphemism that pool is using so he doesn't have to

773
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,639
Call this what it is

774
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,175
This is a person who has a

775
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:28,479
Anti-semitic conclusion that he's justifying

776
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:32,063
Various Jewish people and then pretending a point is being made

777
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,391
Paper-thin and pool can't even handle that

778
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:41,023
And because he's tried to frame this as a localization issue he's walked into a trap that he can't get out of

779
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:47,679
Yeah he's able to respond back to him that people talk about the black vote which actually doesn't even relate to what Tim was

780
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,471
But Tim's point is so weak

781
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:53,055
But I don't think he even has the energy to think it's worth standing on

782
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:59,455
If Timmy pushback on the right thing and called the s*** what it was then this Judo move that yeah and my lower pulley

783
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,223
Wouldn't work

784
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:03,295
It would be transparent how much of an evasion it is

785
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,343
Do that because

786
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,159
That would Place him in a really hostile situation

787
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:15,071
First thing he would land in a super confrontational argument against ye Milo and Nick Fuentes which is a

788
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:15,839
Bad matchups

789
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,607
Pretend

790
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:19,679
I know he has Luke radowski there but that's not really going to help

791
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,983
It's still three on Two And

792
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,543
Milo and Nick are great talker

793
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:28,383
Secondly and even more difficult leave Tim

794
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:34,015
Needs to win that argument or else you would be airing a live stream where he gets out argue by anti-semite

795
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:37,343
He would lose that battle of ideas and that is a real risk

796
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,647
So the reality is that Tim wants nothing more

797
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:43,999
Benton not really push back on this issue and definitely not call it what it is

798
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:47,071
Because I don't think he wants the consequences that come along with that

799
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:51,423
I mean that you is hard-pressed to say ladies and gentlemen

800
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:57,567
After talking with Kanye Milo yiannopoulos and Nick Fuentes

801
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,359
I have to agree

802
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,639
All Jews are bad

803
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:07,295
Well that's not going to go good well it's not going to go good thing about have to admit that but if you

804
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:12,159
Get your ass kicked in an argument on your own showed where the stakes are

805
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:14,463
All Jews are bad

806
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:19,327
Then yes you are saying that I mean I think I think

807
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:22,911
Tim is aware that that is a conversation that

808
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,191
These three

809
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,471
May want to have

810
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:29,567
And I think that's why he's dancing around

811
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:34,687
Calling something anti-semitic instead of being the localization issue or whatever

812
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,455
It's

813
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:40,575
It's somebody who doesn't want to have the conversation while pretending he does

814
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,343
It's it's

815
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:43,135
Fun it's funny

816
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,439
In some ways just because

817
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:47,743
So many of these people are

818
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:48,511
From a distance

819
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,047
It's like watching yay

820
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,095
Pull his b******* going like

821
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,631
Foot pump in their face

822
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:59,007
But when you're in the situation where you have to have professional

823
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,055
A conversation with you

824
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:03,359
He doesn't give a s***

825
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,151
You're you're the loser

826
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:08,735
Jay is gay yeah I mean it's

827
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,783
It is a question of

828
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:16,415
You can watch him say anti-semitic thing

829
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:19,487
On other shows and be like

830
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,535
That's what I wanted my show

831
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:22,815
Right

832
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:23,583
But

833
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:24,607
But

834
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,679
I want him to say it

835
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,447
And then

836
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:32,031
Walk away from it back away like so many other people do

837
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:34,591
You know you're we're so used to seeing people

838
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:38,175
Step over the line and then go on the show the next day and be like

839
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:42,015
Well I didn't mean to step over the line you know like welts knock-off you did

840
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:48,415
You know if you want if if my he wants there to be some sense of life

841
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:51,487
On my show will get V like

842
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:56,607
What I was actually trying to say is blank

843
00:45:56,863 --> 00:46:00,191
Exactly he's not going to worse people with him

844
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:02,239
Yeah it is it is like

845
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:05,055
So transparent

846
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:07,871
How much these people want to exploit

847
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,919
The the anti-semitism

848
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:12,991
But don't want to engage with it

849
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:18,367
You know they wanted to be there they want the fans of anti-Semitism to be there fan

850
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:20,159
But they don't ever want to actually

851
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:23,231
Deal with the anti-Semitism one way or the other

852
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,791
And so when you have Kanye on

853
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,327
You're thinking okay

854
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,351
Here's what I got

855
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:32,191
Get I get all of his power and I get him doing the thing

856
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:35,007
That we all know he's going to do where he says

857
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:35,775
Listen

858
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,823
People misunderstood

859
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,151
People didn't you know that whole thing and it's not going to happen

860
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:47,551
Play I hate the Jews you're not going to be as many words but I think I think that

861
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:49,599
What team would have liked

862
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,367
Is

863
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,135
The

864
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,415
Attention

865
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:56,767
Amount of people putting their eyes on him because of

866
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:03,423
Getting this interview and then that the controversial nice of it

867
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:09,311
Your show and the show is talking about the dinner and talking about some news items

868
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:11,615
And then you have the the Jewish

869
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:18,015
Conversation that they have about Kanye's anti-semitic comment

870
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,039
An issue stuff

871
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:23,647
And that's how you try to push back against it you don't agree with him

872
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,951
You don't get too into the weeds

873
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:27,487
You don't make kind of like

874
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:32,863
Cont condemning statements about it so you can be like I pushed back on this bright

875
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,399
To condemn everybody

876
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,167
You know like

877
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,447
You want to do that

878
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:39,775
You want a b basically having your cake and eating it too and it's just

879
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,055
I don't know it.

880
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:43,359
Why would you think that's going to work I mean

881
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:48,479
Because by putting the localization thing in there he's trying to create boundaries for the

882
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,503
You know like

883
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:51,295
Okay he doesn't give a s***

884
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:54,367
Of course not what part of Jacob's life

885
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,927
Do you think cares about your boundaries

886
00:47:57,183 --> 00:48:03,327
When he was 18 about you twelve-year-old knots

887
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,607
See what do you want yet

888
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:09,727
He started his own like screaming thing

889
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:12,799
And as long as they're associated with gay they don't have to care

890
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,079
They just don't

891
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:18,431
If if Nick Fuentes or Milo where on pool show by themselves

892
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,479
They would suck up to pool

893
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,247
So much

894
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:27,647
Not not really actually Milo's recently on himself

895
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:29,951
He was a little bit he gave some pushback

896
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,999
Tunica

897
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:34,815
The temple.

898
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:41,215
Yeah but he was not as obsequious as you might imagine but my perceptions are wrong

899
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,519
A guy who's

900
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:46,847
And I've got a pretty high sense of himself

901
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:47,615
That's

902
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:50,687
Nobody would ever accuse him of

903
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:54,783
Humility no matter what. Of his career

904
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,855
Miley was saying there

905
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:59,135
That's on me.

906
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:01,695
He puts him in a really bad box

907
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:03,999
It's one that Tim does not want to be in

908
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:07,583
And the reason it's really bad for him is that he thinks it's a great boss

909
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:08,351
Box for him

910
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:10,399
Are you talkin about identity stuff

911
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:16,799
Identity politics this is where I live. My bread-and-butter back on this all the time

912
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:19,615
And now the damn is broken

913
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,943
I I don't like identitarianism

914
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:27,295
You guys are familiar with that is

915
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:30,879
Set the time when I was asking about running for president

916
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:34,207
Milly said well you know you'll be good for the black vote

917
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,743
And I said is that

918
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:36,511
Because I'm black

919
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:37,791
No not just cuz of that

920
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:38,559
So is that

921
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:41,375
Are you doing the same thing I didn't say that was the only

922
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:44,447
I said was because you're personable to the common person

923
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,215
And

924
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,751
You probably would do well with

925
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:50,335
Just because I'm black is a lot of black people don't like me

926
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:51,871
Of course

927
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:54,175
I think I think race plays a role in a lot of thing

928
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,455
Absolutely

929
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,479
What what are we doing here

930
00:49:56,991 --> 00:50:00,575
This is one of Tim's big buzz words he hates identitarianism

931
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:04,415
As far as I can tell from listening to him is just a smarter sounding word

932
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,207
Then if you were to complain about identity politics

933
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:11,071
Make you sound like a Reddit user from 2016 and that is not what Tim is

934
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:17,727
The problem is the Tim isn't consistent about this thinking about things in terms of identity

935
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:24,127
Anti-semitism

936
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:27,711
Brick wall of yeah bring it up and eat said that ye would do well with the black vote

937
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:29,247
Yeah yeah

938
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:31,039
You got a mean that is

939
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:34,111
It's hard not to say that what just happened was

940
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,903
Is Kanye was like

941
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:39,231
He was like I hate identitarianism he was like

942
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:41,023
Yeah you did the thing and he was like

943
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:47,679
No I didn't

944
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:54,079
Also understand that when Tim says identitarian he's not talking about the actual thing identitarianism cuz that is a thing

945
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:58,175
Tim and most of his friends actually are pretty solidly identitarian

946
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:01,247
Political philosophies that word describe

947
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:07,903
Their nationalist they're highly concerned about ideas like the great replacement that he globalism and they're into

948
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:08,671
Nationalism

949
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:14,559
It's pretty clear that this is right in line with the show based on all their video titles and guests

950
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:15,327
By the way

951
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,887
I clearly don't know enough about Tim pools

952
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:19,423
Crew it is show but looking

953
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,447
Through their guest list

954
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,775
I found it one of his producers guest is haunted episode

955
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:24,543
Producers

956
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,567
Co-host

957
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,591
Quite frankly

958
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:28,639
And I do that

959
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:33,247
She's one of the people who steps in wenge leaves to fill in one of the chairs

960
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:38,623
One of the people who takes over and it's clearly part of the show is a woman named Hannah Claire brimlow

961
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,647
Who's the daughter

962
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,671
Peter brimelow

963
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,951
The founder of video

964
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:46,303
The outlet that's known for promoting white nationalist anti-semitic writers

965
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:48,095
It's so weird

966
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,631
She's one of those co-host

967
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:52,447
I mean it's what it's just

968
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:55,775
It's like being a tall man

969
00:51:56,031 --> 00:52:00,895
It's like I just wish it wasn't so easy to see through them

970
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,431
Because when it is

971
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:07,295
So easy and it makes you feel bad about the rest of the people who don't

972
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:08,575
You know

973
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,343
Cuz it's

974
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,879
It's like when you

975
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:13,183
If you're doing the the like

976
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,743
F******

977
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,791
Simple addition

978
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,071
Worksheet

979
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:21,375
You know we're like 9 + 3

980
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:24,959
And you see if somebody struggling with you know like 5 + 7

981
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:25,983
Cuz I get it

982
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:29,055
You know you think it's going to be 14 I do all the time

983
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:32,383
And you're like oh you're so close man

984
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,919
And it makes you feel bad

985
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:36,991
And this makes me feel bad feel bad

986
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:40,319
Well know that these people are allowed

987
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:42,879
What's the next of kin make you feel bad to Crate

988
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:48,767
So this is like a little bit longer clip by 3 minutes because I wanted to retain it and it's contacts

989
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,071
This is just

990
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:52,863
Talking

991
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:59,263
Just talking just talking smart people talking all over the place. It's Smiley one person

992
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:03,359
I think the I to the constructs of race

993
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:07,711
Has really been forced upon us as just something for us to be woke about in

994
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:10,527
Cassie talk about and use it as these like

995
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:11,551
Walls

996
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:14,111
Say the same thing about Judaism

997
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,647
Well let's look at the facts

998
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:16,671
Acts of what I'm saying though

999
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,695
If you say

1000
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:19,231
In this neighborhood

1001
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:22,047
Where they gerrymander this this amount of time

1002
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,583
Hey I wasn't doing that

1003
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,607
Is gerrymandering

1004
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,375
The lawyers

1005
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:31,775
Hollywood and the people at the bank that D bank to me and then froze my account

1006
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:36,895
You know it's like we wanted jumping to protecting the idea that we can't put a net

1007
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:37,919
Around something

1008
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,711
Thing right but that's been my job is

1009
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:40,479
Producer

1010
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:41,503
To take

1011
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:43,039
You know

1012
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:46,367
Aroy air sample and put a James Brown drum

1013
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,159
And put it within a two

1014
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:49,183
2 minutes

1015
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:49,951
3 minutes

1016
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:51,743
Song that's the way

1017
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:53,023
I actually think

1018
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,815
And that's the way I talk

1019
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:57,375
And now this morning I found out

1020
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:59,679
That they were trying to put me in prison

1021
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,471
Because what they did was

1022
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:06,591
I moved 140 million dollars into

1023
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,895
JPMorgan

1024
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:13,247
I said I want to talk to Jamie dimon like look at me I'm just going in naive

1025
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:18,111
You know multi-billionaire like maybe maybe Jamie dimon will let me in

1026
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,647
On some dealflow

1027
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:26,047
Wrong why are you laughing

1028
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,327
Start complaining

1029
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,351
Online

1030
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,631
And the Navy Bank

1031
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,423
Complaining

1032
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,727
I'm about to get dbank they like

1033
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:35,007
You need to go to

1034
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:40,895
Props the bay X or whatever you got to go and I'm like I've been trying to buy my own bank for the longest

1035
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:41,919
And then we figured out

1036
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:45,247
How to get my old Vegas like 50 million 75-million so

1037
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:47,807
I'm about to buy out my own bank but then

1038
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:50,111
As you're about to take the money out

1039
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:53,439
Here Comes Adidas with a 270

1040
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:55,231
75 million-dollar bill

1041
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:58,047
For marketing funds that they agreed upon

1042
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:01,631
Cuz I said to them hey I'm the marketing give me the marketing fun

1043
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:04,447
Which proves by the response they got when they

1044
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:07,519
You know stole the design to say we're going to not calling uses anymore

1045
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:09,311
So this is what I was already fighting

1046
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:11,103
Adidas Force I'm fighting

1047
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:11,871
Gap

1048
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,407
Get out of Gap fighting

1049
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,687
Adidas

1050
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:17,503
And then I deal with this little bit of noise from

1051
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:18,783
You know

1052
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:21,855
Zionism from the fashion world where they used it

1053
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:26,463
This plant named Gabby who's obviously like some kind of CIA agent knows nothing about

1054
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,231
Fashion

1055
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:30,559
This is a certain thing when someone can't dress

1056
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:33,375
You know that they're not like a fashion person

1057
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,167
They're just there as like

1058
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:40,031
This is site like the control that they try to use with celebrities which has now been broken right

1059
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:41,311
Cuz you know where it broke

1060
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:42,847
Okay

1061
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:44,895
I want to get on like LeBron

1062
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:48,735
But I'm going to come back to this and just talk about this morning

1063
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:49,503
Where

1064
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:52,831
You know I'm not going to mention her name cuz

1065
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,623
She's a nice lady with someone it, Reg

1066
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:56,927
Resnick tells me and I tell my

1067
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:57,951
All of my

1068
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:59,999
The finance people never use the term a lot

1069
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:02,047
But he said okay you got to pay a lot

1070
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:02,815
Metaxas

1071
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:05,631
And that made me feel like they're just like waiting like

1072
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:07,423
We finally got them we finally can

1073
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:14,079
Put them in jail I was like can I still run for president jail I thought I could help. Okay

1074
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:26,879
Just like JPMorgan & Chase did just like Deutsche Bank did so there is an issue to bring up with that but when it comes to the Rain

1075
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:32,511
This is an important discussion to have because what we have to have to complete the Salt you guys got

1076
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:38,911
Yeah well played Luke radowski the great-great interjection

1077
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:41,215
Completion of that thought you don't know

1078
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:47,103
Tangential is hell

1079
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,639
Conclusion I come to is that you

1080
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:50,175
Kind of a bigot

1081
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:50,943
Confused

1082
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:52,223
I want to like

1083
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:52,991
The beginning of

1084
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:56,063
I don't think he understands what gerrymandering is

1085
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:00,927
No I know that was minutes ago but

1086
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:03,743
Hey doesn't quite get that one no no

1087
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:10,143
The other thing is that he's saying that they're trying to put him in jail and apparently the rationale for that

1088
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:12,447
Is he found out he has a lot of taxes

1089
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:16,031
And that's they're trying to put him in jail or is it just you a lot of tact

1090
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:19,103
I don't know but this is all over the place

1091
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:22,943
And like this kind of a rambling thing going on this long

1092
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,735
Tells you that Tim has

1093
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,015
Lost control

1094
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:28,063
He is not in control of this year

1095
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:34,463
Is giving up essentially on in any way trying to be a host on the show

1096
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:40,863
He brings up f****** Epstein for some reason I need to get shut down by getting saying I need to finish my thought and then

1097
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,399
Jokes

1098
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,423
So great

1099
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:44,959
Yeah man

1100
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:45,983
This is

1101
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,007
This is tough

1102
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:50,079
This is tough to listen to because it does feel like

1103
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:53,151
What needs to happen is

1104
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:58,271
Soulquarians need to kidnap Kanye and take him to a f******

1105
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:01,855
Ayahuasca Retreat together and then they'll be fine like

1106
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:04,415
8 steel L f****** in

1107
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:10,815
Staying like he's surrounded by the worst people in the middle of

1108
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:13,375
I mean clearly an inability to think

1109
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:15,167
Just I mean just

1110
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:15,935
That's

1111
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:20,543
That's not a question I'm not saying that it makes him anti-semitic by anymore

1112
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:23,871
But there is a clear inability to think there's a

1113
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:26,687
Clear processing tangential

1114
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:29,247
Thought organizational

1115
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:31,551
Stop being depressed

1116
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:36,159
It's pretty clear the way that a jumps to c22 Alton

1117
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:38,207
Abby

1118
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:38,975
It's a

1119
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:45,375
No and there's been tons of talk about it you know the that mental illness and how people are trying to handle

1120
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:49,215
So it seems like he's having a manic episode obviously we don't know if

1121
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:51,007
For sure we don't know his doctor or whatever

1122
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:56,383
Brendan at the same time you know obviously I'm bipolar I've had plenty of manic episodes where I've never

1123
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:00,991
Claimed that lawyers were at fault for me going to jail because they were Jewish

1124
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:04,575
Never happened I understand that those two things are not

1125
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:10,207
Connected to each other they can happen at the same time and not like 1 be the cause of the other

1126
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:13,791
Right but at the same time in this regard

1127
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:16,095
This is somebody who is

1128
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:22,495
If you're timid like listening to this you should not be like oh this is it this is how I should be engaging in

1129
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:23,263
We need to stop

1130
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:26,335
We need to stop this is not accept

1131
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:28,127
At very least

1132
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:32,479
You do well I mean you do have responsibilities train at the interview

1133
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,015
I think quite frankly

1134
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:39,647
But it is not at least try to bring some structure to

1135
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:41,183
Like what's going on

1136
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:45,279
Because this is just rambling

1137
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,815
Here's what I will say

1138
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:47,839
About this

1139
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,119
5

1140
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:50,399
As a Bipolar person

1141
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:53,215
If this is me in temples place

1142
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:55,519
We're done with the interview

1143
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:59,615
I'm taking Kanye and we're just going to go we're just going to go sit

1144
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:04,223
I know it feels like that's a

1145
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:06,783
No I understand that but it's like it's got to stop

1146
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:13,183
It's got to stop it he's got to go it's kind I understand it feels trite to be like oh we need to go sit I mean

1147
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:15,487
Literally I need to go be in a room with him

1148
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:18,559
Where there's no interruptions are impulses

1149
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:24,959
Or any contrite off Nick with a broom need to be that situation because this is unacceptable

1150
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:27,519
People are using him

1151
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,591
Does go on

1152
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:31,359
Of course

1153
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:34,687
Next year I was supposed to make 500 million dollars

1154
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,223
And royalties in like

1155
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:37,247
No one needs

1156
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:38,783
This amount

1157
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:39,551
A money

1158
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:43,903
But when I would work on homeless shelters and ideas that have a contractor

1159
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:45,183
It won't say what race

1160
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:47,231
And

1161
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:52,607
You know they'd be tearing down the contracts it's all about

1162
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:56,703
You know position is not about the amount of money that you have and

1163
01:00:56,959 --> 01:01:01,823
You know the coming here I feel like it's a setup to be like defending I'm not going to go through another

1164
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,103
Like I'm literally going to

1165
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,151
Walk the F off the show

1166
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:06,943
If I'm sitting up here having a

1167
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:07,711
You know

1168
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:11,295
Talk about you can't say that it was Jewish people that did it

1169
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:16,927
When every sensible person knows that I mean John Stuart knows

1170
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:19,743
What happened to me any took it too far it was like

1171
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:21,023
American History X

1172
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:23,327
Like my head was on the side of the Curve

1173
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:24,607
And

1174
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:26,655
The exact people that I called out

1175
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:29,471
Kick my head we found out that my trainer was at

1176
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,007
MK Ultra

1177
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,799
Canadian

1178
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:36,383
He worked in the defense research

1179
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:37,663
And

1180
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:43,295
In the Canadian military essentially working on psyops

1181
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:51,487
Luke rudowski throw it into support I do not only to jump into Double Down

1182
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:57,887
That your trainer is an MK Ultra

1183
01:01:58,143 --> 01:02:02,495
So this is been legitimately like 5 minutes straight of a rambling about

1184
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:07,359
Entirely like a almost entirely uninterrupted about a wide selection of topics

1185
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:10,175
With only the thinnest connective tissue existing

1186
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:10,943
Between them

1187
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:14,783
And now he's getting defensive about the whole thing about how he's anti-Semitic

1188
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:17,087
He was the one who brought it up to begin with

1189
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,135
Tim would have loved

1190
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:19,903
To save that

1191
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:23,743
For the apart the show that's behind a paywall or very least the end of the show

1192
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:25,791
But they did not let that happen

1193
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:32,959
Harley Pasternak is a personal trainer for celebrities but one of his previous gigs was working with a Canadian Department of National to

1194
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:40,127
One of the things they're at they did was running studies on drugs and how they affect various aspects of soldiers performance

1195
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:42,943
It's like things that keep people up for a long. Of time that work

1196
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:44,479
Stimulants chair cetera

1197
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:48,063
There's no indication that he is MKUltra but he's Jewish

1198
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:50,367
So that explains a preoccupation with him

1199
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:52,671
You posted a couple of a legend

1200
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:59,071
Screenshots of messages Pasternak sent him where pastrnak was threatening to quote have you institutionalized again where they met

1201
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:02,143
Medicate the crap out of you and you go back to Zombieland forever

1202
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:04,447
I have no idea if he's a real tax

1203
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:09,567
But honestly if his guys some big-time Hollywood celebrity had like there's no way you would make a threat like that in text

1204
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:13,663
If the evil cabal was that sloppy they be getting busted all over

1205
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:15,711
It would fall apart so fast

1206
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:17,503
Larger point

1207
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:18,783
Tim is doing nothing

1208
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:23,903
I'm here he's not been able to come up with any decent rebuttals to this s*** and the things

1209
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:25,951
Does they end up getting him a traps

1210
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:30,559
I doubt he's just let ye monologue for what feels like a lifetime and that's not even good enough

1211
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:35,679
They still managed to somehow feel like he's being put on trial for rambling about a topic that

1212
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:37,215
But he brought up himself

1213
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:39,775
Fire pool I just wouldn't have done this interview

1214
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:40,799
Listen

1215
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:42,335
Listen all I'm going to say

1216
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:44,127
Is I don't want to get caught up

1217
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:48,223
In one of these things where we talked about how I I'm an anti-semite

1218
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:49,247
I want

1219
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:51,551
To constantly make jokes

1220
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:53,087
And implications

1221
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:57,183
That all Jews are bad and I don't want you to push

1222
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,487
I want you to laugh

1223
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:02,047
At my funny I hate you jokes

1224
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:08,447
Like these two white nationalist do right over here he's got a dumb face he's laughing right now

1225
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:14,079
Not really jokes

1226
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:20,479
F****** crazy I feel like it's generous to say the fees are implications in Roanoke

1227
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:23,039
It is one of those

1228
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:28,159
Far-right sings where everybody laughs when you say the thing that you mean you know like

1229
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:29,439
You say like

1230
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,207
Oh and

1231
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:32,511
I hate Jews and everybody laughs but

1232
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:34,559
They all know that you do you mean it

1233
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:35,839
You do mean that

1234
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:42,239
Nick is a little bit better about this whenever he is on his own making things

1235
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:47,615
That's why you look that's why you're laughing speaking of Nick

1236
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:50,175
Call Guy come up all that much

1237
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:52,479
Smart but here's ears

1238
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:54,527
Tim pool decides to bring him into it

1239
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,831
Before the show obviously I'm getting a bunch of message

1240
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,135
Shopping or like you shouldn't have

1241
01:04:59,391 --> 01:04:59,903
Most of them

1242
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:01,695
Their Aunty somatic there

1243
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:02,975
Primus the racist

1244
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:05,791
I do find the idea I do find it

1245
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:08,351
Funny or whatever that you know Nick they call you white supremacist

1246
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,119
Sister here

1247
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:09,887
Working with Thor

1248
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:10,655
44 you know

1249
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:11,423
Powerful

1250
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,215
One of the wealthiest in

1251
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,263
But spot

1252
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:17,823
People are saying other rights physically don't platform

1253
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,895
That's how you're going to

1254
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:22,175
Bring up Nick

1255
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:28,575
People say that you're a white nationalist but you're working with a lifetime how do you feel about that

1256
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:30,367
Your this is

1257
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:31,647
This is ridiculous

1258
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,719
That's you were

1259
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:41,119
Your response to like all people make these accusations about eunuch but you couldn't possibly be because you hang out with this

1260
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:44,703
That's like a Niger

1261
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:47,519
Your white nationalist there's a black man next to you

1262
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:49,055
See that then you move on

1263
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:55,455
It's not even like a statement is a defense in a deflection of racism

1264
01:05:55,711 --> 01:06:01,855
This is sanitizing and making Nick palatable by pretending to read the arguments the people make against

1265
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:03,647
Everybody's stupid

1266
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:08,511
Speaks ill of white nationalist you know but here we have one sitting next to a black man

1267
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:12,351
No one's dead sea white nationalists are people too

1268
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:15,679
Get back to

1269
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:16,703
The things he really wants

1270
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:17,727
Let's talk about course

1271
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:21,311
Then I said well I want it I want understand what they're thinking weather thinking it

1272
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:25,151
They're part of that they're involved in what may be the biggest news story of the past week and we have enough

1273
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:27,455
How does the red media

1274
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:29,759
Controls both sides it just said it as simple as possible

1275
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:30,783
Put Jared Kushner

1276
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:31,807
Who's next

1277
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:33,087
Ron emanuel's next

1278
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:37,439
Obama 1940

1279
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:41,535
Really wonder what ye was about to say things have been happening since

1280
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:47,423
WD-40 since 1940 I'm sorry what excuse me we're talking about this

1281
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:51,263
We're talking about the Jews you were about to say 19:4

1282
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:57,663
19 for needed British that thought to imagine the Tim is glad that he didn't finish that

1283
01:06:57,919 --> 01:07:03,039
Whatever that was probably wasn't good-looking tackler

1284
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:07,391
On the edge just being like Hey listen eventually you're going to be me

1285
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,951
So they threatened

1286
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:10,975
To leave again

1287
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:15,839
Whatever he did storm out I really don't think anyone should have been surprised

1288
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:17,119
Even in the room

1289
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,655
But he brought it up twice

1290
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:20,447
But he's right

1291
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,983
Because of things that

1292
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:25,823
The topics that he himself has decided to complain about

1293
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:29,919
And the non-existent pushback and reframing actually

1294
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:32,223
Trying to do to make his beliefs

1295
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:35,807
Acceptable unpalatable to the audience oh okay so

1296
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:37,087
Hey buddy are you going to leave

1297
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:38,879
Cuz the red media

1298
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:41,183
Controls both sides it just said it as simple as

1299
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:42,207
Jared Kushner

1300
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:43,231
Who's next

1301
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:48,863
Ron emanuel's next to Obama 1940

1302
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:53,215
Sliq here at your shop and I have I'm going to get on going to order

1303
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:59,871
With the last of my money that's available in a different account I'm going to order a PJ before I sit in hats or tell another

1304
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:01,919
Set up conversation

1305
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:04,223
When when I'm literally

1306
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:06,527
Trying to trying to put me in jail for my opinion

1307
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:10,111
But I am not that I'm not going to have that opinion I don't care about

1308
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:10,879
People

1309
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:12,415
The peep those are Bots

1310
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,719
They're trying to take me realize I can pets

1311
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:16,255
He's so Trump out

1312
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:18,303
You got me saying this like I would have never

1313
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:20,863
I wanted to do anything that hurt

1314
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:23,167
Trump I'm on I'm on Trump side Trump

1315
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:24,703
Set things that hurt me

1316
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:28,543
He lied about me but I mean he's known for lying and when people use to tell me

1317
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:30,847
That he's a liar it's like

1318
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:34,943
And I went into the trenches for Trump that's another conversation there was no one in my position

1319
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:36,223
That wore that hat

1320
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:42,111
And all of my surrounding was like death by a thousand questions and I'm jumping to another

1321
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:44,671
Thanks but what I'm saying is I know you got a rep

1322
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:45,439
For your

1323
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:49,023
European people online but it's like you got a person in real life that

1324
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:52,863
Alright I'm not with it bro I lost I lost the money

1325
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:54,399
For the freedom of speech

1326
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:56,447
And that's what makes me the only

1327
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:58,239
American that we know that

1328
01:08:58,495 --> 01:09:02,591
Really deserves to run the country cuz everyone else your boy DeSantis

1329
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:05,151
Trump whoever they think they

1330
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:07,455
Raising a petri dish soap on the Democrats

1331
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:12,063
It's is going to play the game

1332
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:14,879
You went right into the anti-semite then

1333
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:18,975
I think it's something that should be talked about but if you if you start bringing this up you can ask my opinion.

1334
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:22,303
Disagree with you I didn't ask your opinion on it you know but I'm going to it

1335
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:26,399
I don't care about your pay I like your opinion on how we win election

1336
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:29,727
They're about anybody's opinion bro I lost

1337
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:31,263
They try to put me in jail

1338
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,543
They block 2

1339
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:33,311
2

1340
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:35,103
Billion dollars I had

1341
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:38,687
Hyperactive Farrakhan I said look I was it anti-semite

1342
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:40,479
Somatoform you say his name I like

1343
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:41,503
I administer

1344
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:45,343
Yeah the minister like I tell my mama mode

1345
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,367
All he was

1346
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:47,647
Yeah I mean

1347
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:49,439
A Jewish people allowed

1348
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:51,487
Obama to meet

1349
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:53,535
With the minister you know so

1350
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:57,119
Yeah

1351
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:02,751
I can't imagine Tim is sitting here thinking like

1352
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:06,847
That there's a going to make it to minute 30

1353
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:12,223
Yeah she is already saying I don't care about your opinion right

1354
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:15,807
I'm going to say bye Auntie do stuff I don't give a s***

1355
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:18,623
You kind of get just got to be like

1356
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:20,159
Yeah it is

1357
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:23,487
Almost like storming out tonight deal

1358
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:25,279
Turn of events

1359
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:27,071
No I mean I

1360
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,095
Frankly

1361
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:34,239
We're we're in asiimov storm out at this point I feel like if you bring it up twice you've got

1362
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:36,799
Bright and Kanye still the Showman

1363
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:38,847
So he's not going to not

1364
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:41,663
Hey doormat

1365
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:48,063
Flamboyant a storm out as you might hope it is a leaving none the last fairly bruh

1366
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:53,695
Man I think if I'm Tim pool all that's going on in my head right now is

1367
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:56,255
Great job Tim pool

1368
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:59,839
People are going to pay so much attention to me I'm a big boy

1369
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:04,959
I do think that there is an interesting Dynamic where Tim

1370
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:09,055
Feels like he's disagreeing with ya in a meaningful way

1371
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:10,847
And that is not happen

1372
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:14,175
I understand that he's

1373
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:20,575
Vicky's disagreeing with you by saying this is a localization issue or something like that

1374
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:22,879
That's not challenging

1375
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:27,487
Weight of what Kanye believe it's just putting another hat on it

1376
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:30,303
Maybe looks better to Tim pools audio

1377
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:32,095
Right so they can accept

1378
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:34,655
The content of what ye saying

1379
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:37,471
Just do a different way right look at it a little bit

1380
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:41,055
I mean these are all far right people

1381
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:42,079
Who

1382
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:44,383
Live under this guise of

1383
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:46,431
I say whatever I want

1384
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:47,455
Because

1385
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:52,063
The sensors have you no like I I will be uncensored and so if you

1386
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:54,111
If you turn me off or whatever I'll keep

1387
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:57,695
Keep saying whatever I want but they don't understand what it actually means

1388
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:58,975
To not give a f***

1389
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:00,255
About what anybody says

1390
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:02,559
Like they all lived on this pretend

1391
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:06,655
We put on this cape of like all the mainstream media hates us

1392
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:12,543
And they still pretend that they don't have a complete and utter obligation to say whatever it is that Their audience wants

1393
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:13,567
You know like

1394
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:15,871
You guys just say whatever your audience wants

1395
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:18,175
What's the same way that you think other people are

1396
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:20,223
Containing your speech or whatever

1397
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:22,527
Kanye really does not give a f***

1398
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:24,319
He is going to say

1399
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:26,111
Whatever the f*** he wants

1400
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:32,767
And it really doesn't matter to him that's that's what they don't understand they don't understand

1401
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:34,815
A person who truly

1402
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:36,351
Does not care

1403
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:40,959
I am somebody who truly doesn't care and is unable to buy

1404
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:44,287
At least two people in the room who

1405
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:50,943
Have a very strong interested in because he doesn't give a f***

1406
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:57,599
Really Advanced their world with sorrow man and

1407
01:12:57,855 --> 01:13:00,927
Wormtongue that's just how it goes man that's how it is

1408
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:04,511
Here is where it all falls apart

1409
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:06,303
Has been a ramble

1410
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,071
Of course

1411
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:09,119
That leads into it and then I guess

1412
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:10,399
Gay just decides

1413
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,167
I've had enough

1414
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:14,751
The contract for the next four years if I hadn't done anything

1415
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:17,311
Would have been 500 million dollars

1416
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:18,847
A year for four years

1417
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:21,663
What I was fighting for was the IP

1418
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:23,455
So my children

1419
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,479
Could

1420
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,551
You know

1421
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:28,831
I'm sorry

1422
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:31,135
Sometimes I think about 7 thoughts at one time

1423
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:33,951
Because anything I see I come over like 7 answer

1424
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:35,743
What it is

1425
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:36,511
But

1426
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:39,839
But the thing is when I said my children with the reason why my

1427
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:41,119
My brain kind of

1428
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,655
Block because it's like

1429
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:43,935
God is saying

1430
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:47,263
You know your your children are going to be okay

1431
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:48,287
Baby mamas

1432
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:49,311
Got money right

1433
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:52,383
God is using me he's breaking me

1434
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:53,151
Is down

1435
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:55,199
Removing all of the

1436
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:58,783
You know richest person all of this so I can serve him

1437
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:02,623
And the more more those things are taken away from me the more I can be

1438
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:04,415
Empty and be a vessel

1439
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:06,719
And be able to be used in right now it's like

1440
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:08,511
You're not going to take

1441
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:12,095
If we can't you not going to take my pain away right

1442
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:13,631
Did the Jewish people say

1443
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:15,679
It's the Holocaust this happen

1444
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:18,751
And you can't say anything about it we can't take their pain away

1445
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:21,055
No one's going to denounce the fact that

1446
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:23,359
They tried to lock me up

1447
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:26,431
That's because every time I'm just holding stride

1448
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:27,199
And it's like

1449
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:31,039
I didn't I thought it was more Malcolm X but I find out I'm more MLK

1450
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:34,367
Because I'm getting hose down everyday by the Press

1451
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:36,415
And financially I'm just standing there

1452
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:39,743
And went when I found out that they tried to put me in jail

1453
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:41,279
It was like a dog

1454
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:45,631
With biting my arm and I almost shed a tear

1455
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:46,399
Almost

1456
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:48,191
But I still walked in stripe through it

1457
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:51,263
Yeah I think I think they've been used

1458
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:52,543
I who is Beto

1459
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:54,591
We can't tell you they is tamarind

1460
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:56,383
I'm not even though I don't use the word is

1461
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:59,967
Do you guys use the bathroom though isn't it I mean

1462
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:03,039
Considerate

1463
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:05,343
828

1464
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:08,671
What what do I mean like okay so how about

1465
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:10,719
Believing

1466
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:15,327
He's on

1467
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:17,375
I'll say right now

1468
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:19,935
You got a II

1469
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:21,471
You guys want to bring that stuff up

1470
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:27,871
And say

1471
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:34,271
Here's my painted myself everyday I hear you and that he's going to say and it was Jewish people and I'm to be like okay but don't you consider so I'm not going to do that

1472
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:37,599
All right go for it looking I love the conversation

1473
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:39,903
So I can't say I'm surprised

1474
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:42,975
What what what what what do I even do

1475
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:49,631
Rather than ask him please elaborate on this are you referring to individuals are you quite literally blaming an entire group of people

1476
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:52,959
For the fact that powerful individuals are causing you harm

1477
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:56,287
I don't think that he did do that

1478
01:15:56,543 --> 01:16:00,383
He's giving himself a credit for having like

1479
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:06,783
It provided a little bit of push back in like Kanye can't handle this or whatever but that's not the case at all

1480
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:08,319
Jay made himself mad

1481
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:10,111
At 9 left because

1482
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:12,415
Tim just didn't play along

1483
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:14,975
Basically I mean you didn't even push back

1484
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:15,999
Really

1485
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,023
I would say

1486
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:18,047
That if

1487
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:20,351
You put

1488
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:22,143
The camera on him

1489
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:26,495
And didn't have Tim or anyone else there

1490
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:33,407
Then eventually if he were talking for 20 minutes he would have stood up and left anyways right regardless of what anyone

1491
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:40,831
Talkin to get to 100 different topics eventually complain about some Jewish people at 90 like

1492
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:44,415
Position I need to defend myself to myself

1493
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:50,303
I'm out of here I mean what's fun about it is that they

1494
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:54,143
Clearly are not recognizing that they are so meaningless

1495
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,167
An empty

1496
01:16:55,423 --> 01:17:01,567
Compared if Tim wants the credit for what he's giving himself credit for he

1497
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:02,591
Should have given

1498
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:04,895
Far more concrete pushed back

1499
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:08,223
Do the very ridiculous things that were being sad

1500
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:09,503
He would have

1501
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,527
Maybe try

1502
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:13,087
To get some clarity on somebody rambling points

1503
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:15,135
Went nowhere and didn't get finished

1504
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:20,255
Like they're at there's a completely different set of behaviors that you would have expected if you was going to be like

1505
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:26,399
I can't be expected to just let ye show up and say these things and expected I'm not going to

1506
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:27,935
You're like no you didn't do that

1507
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:29,727
That's a fiction

1508
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:32,543
That you're painting now that he has left through right

1509
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:34,591
Congratulations for that

1510
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:35,615
But you didn't

1511
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:36,639
Right

1512
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:37,663
This is not a

1513
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:43,551
Frost Nixon matter what he did

1514
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:45,343
.

1515
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,623
We can talk about that

1516
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:48,927
I'll meet you for sure

1517
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:54,815
Is it is unacceptable that kind of Milo and Nick together

1518
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:55,839
Sure I'm just

1519
01:17:58,143 --> 01:18:00,191
I think that there's a certain world

1520
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:02,239
We're if it's just gay

1521
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:03,519
You could

1522
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:06,079
Potentially provide pushback

1523
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:09,407
You know he probably end up leaving anyway

1524
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:10,431
Just like this

1525
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:14,271
When you have the three of them there there's no win

1526
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:20,159
Well you're either going to end up in this situation or worst case scenario they respond

1527
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:24,767
And you can't handle V3 on one that's going on

1528
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:26,559
The Milo Nick and yay

1529
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:33,215
And you just end up looking like an idiot getting Dunked On by ants

1530
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:36,543
One of them and you're the you're the one with your hands tied behind your back

1531
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:39,359
You're the one who can't say I know I agree with you

1532
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:43,711
You know whether or not that's the case I'm not entirely sure like

1533
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:46,783
You are definitely in a position that they are not in

1534
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:48,063
I would say

1535
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:50,111
The problem I have is

1536
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:56,511
I don't want there's no reason to have ye on even by himself because what are you going to eat what are you going to put

1537
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:57,279
Push back on

1538
01:18:58,047 --> 01:19:01,119
If the Sun is going to be completely different two seconds later

1539
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:03,679
What are you going to convince him of

1540
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:05,727
That won't then be different

1541
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:06,751
Two seconds later

1542
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:08,799
Is he going to

1543
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:11,871
Follow you all the way through to the conclusion with

1544
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:17,247
Yours no it's not even that you're just having them on there as a

1545
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:23,647
Play f****** freak is a freak Show if you're intending that it's not it's

1546
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:28,255
Same thing that you can expect a lot of these folks on the right to be doing which is trying to

1547
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:32,351
Chase whatever attention they can get by proximity to

1548
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:34,911
What are a giant celebrity

1549
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:37,727
What Kanye on a dunk tank it would have been a better show

1550
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:40,543
Because what this is is unlistenable garbage

1551
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:45,663
And it's a f****** freak Show so you don't embrace it cuz that's what you're doing

1552
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:47,967
If I may be so bold

1553
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:50,015
I did listen to after he left

1554
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:56,415
Are you show is better when he was up

1555
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:58,975
Attention

1556
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:05,375
Is something going to break what's going to happen here afterwards it's just him sitting there with the daughter of the guy who

1557
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:11,007
Who made it to repair Loop radowski and some other lady talking about how great a job Tim did

1558
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:17,408
And how he's a big boy it's nice it's him sitting going from sitting with five anti-semites to

1559
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:23,808
Just too and that's really nice or the other leg

1560
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:30,208
Lady is who was in there I know there's a be there daughter Luke nasty

1561
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:32,000
Woman but I don't know who she is

1562
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:34,048
Earlier saying

1563
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:36,096
It is dumb though isn't it

1564
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:39,168
As if he didn't understand exactly who that that

1565
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,216
Oh that was Mick

1566
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:44,032
Check out that was his voice

1567
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:47,872
I seen a lot of response to things like

1568
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:52,736
How does he think he can run for president if he can't stand a little push back in the interview

1569
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:54,784
And I think of that missing some important point

1570
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:59,904
The first is that two people inclined to like yeah and respond to the message that he's putting out

1571
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:02,976
Leaving this interview doesn't actually signal weakness

1572
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:05,024
It comes off as kind of

1573
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:07,840
Strong be there

1574
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:10,400
Only person who doesn't need to be there

1575
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:16,800
The second thing is that if you just watched the minute prior to the storming out it kind of does appear like Tim is give

1576
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:17,824
Giving some pushback

1577
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:22,176
Actor yeah but I don't think that's necessarily a fair way to characterize the rest of the interview

1578
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:25,248
If anything gay on entered this interview having

1579
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:26,272
Just said a bunch of

1580
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:28,064
Comically anti-semitic stuff

1581
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:32,672
Proceeded to say Eddy's medic nonsense and Tim did his best to sanitize it so the audience

1582
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:35,744
Could see it as something other than anti-semitism

1583
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:41,888
It was a localization issue or an instance of identity arianism but it wasn't the thing that it obviously was

1584
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:47,008
This wasn't an episode of Tim given pushback to gaze idea than ye not being able to handle it

1585
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:48,544
It was a case of Timothy

1586
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:51,616
Failing in an effort to whitewash the things gay was saying

1587
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:55,712
Whether or not that was a conscious intent that's exactly what temperature

1588
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:57,248
Or failed to achieve

1589
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:59,808
I know shade on Tim for failing on that ever

1590
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:05,952
He clearly had no interest in participating in the same position of his ship

1591
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:11,328
The problem as I see it is that this happened in the first place as used

1592
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:12,096
Basically

1593
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:15,424
The way down and all that is pretty much what you'd expect

1594
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,960
Considering the players involved

1595
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:23,360
It's flashy and kind of funny to see if she'll go off the rails but it wasn't even good in that world

1596
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:29,760
World likes people like storming off shows way better instances of that happening

1597
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:30,528
Somehow

1598
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:31,552
Somehow

1599
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:33,600
For the first time in history

1600
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:36,672
Gallagher has outshone condo

1601
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:46,656
Unfortunately there are some things here that can't be ignored

1602
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:48,448
The fact is that Trump

1603
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:50,752
Has announced that he's running in 2024

1604
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:57,152
Factors that ye is claimed that he's running in 2024 in the middle of a series of public appearances where he seems to be becoming a

1605
01:22:57,408 --> 01:23:00,480
Increasingly comfortable in places of public anti-semite

1606
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:06,880
Admits that he's attached himself to Nick Fuentes and Milo yiannopoulos who are only going to push him further down that road

1607
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:08,160
Road to serve their own purposes

1608
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:12,256
And Trump had dinner with ye who brought his crew along

1609
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:15,584
I don't think that dinner is something that you be ignored but I

1610
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:21,984
I think that the least meaningful way to cover it is have a freewheeling interview with ye Milo and Nick like Tim pool decide

1611
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:22,752
He was going to do

1612
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:26,336
If you're trying to get to the bottom of what happened do some reporting on it

1613
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:31,200
Maybe you try to find a source in the staff at Mar-A-Lago who was there and maybe could tell you

1614
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:33,248
An unbiased outside or opinion

1615
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,808
Nick and Milo are not reliable sources

1616
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:38,368
Is particularly about things that have to do with themselves

1617
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:41,440
And I think Tim knew full well what he was getting with yay

1618
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:47,584
I haven't received a number of times about people like Rogan book and Gaston editorial decision in and of itself

1619
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:54,240
When you're inviting on people like this and you're not fully prepared to have a very confrontational interview you're having them onto promo

1620
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:55,776
Think about that

1621
01:23:56,544 --> 01:24:02,688
One of the only things that Tim even said about Fuentes was defending him from accusations of being a white supremacist

1622
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:04,224
Because he's working with yay

1623
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:10,880
There was no acknowledgement that within the like the last Bond Nick is called for the expulsion of Jews from the country

1624
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:11,904
That wasn't a like

1625
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:13,440
What he was doing was like a

1626
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:15,488
How could you be racist if you have a black

1627
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:18,560
Friend level defensive Nick look at the ridiculous

1628
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:19,840
That is a choice

1629
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:25,728
And it's Tim showing deference to these creeps because his goal never was to provide meaningful pushback

1630
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:29,312
To the toxic ideas that they're responsible for

1631
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:30,080
Spreading

1632
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:33,920
We do have to acknowledge that this is happening whether we like it or not

1633
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:39,808
It very well may end up being the case that ye doesn't actually make it to running for president and even if he does

1634
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:45,184
Seems like you'd have to run as a third-party candidate so he may not even have to appear in debate

1635
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:48,512
So the idea of him not being able to say no to a debate might even be

1636
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:49,280
F****** a relative

1637
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:54,656
But even if he doesn't make it to primary season there is a reason to take this seriously

1638
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:58,752
Many of them are matters for experts and other fields

1639
01:24:59,008 --> 01:25:00,800
To discuss but from my standpoint

1640
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:01,824
Many of these roads

1641
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:02,848
Be back to make polenta

1642
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:08,224
Being involved in this will give him a higher-profile campaign experience

1643
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:13,088
And bring him into even closer contact with whatever political figures end up supporting yay

1644
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:17,184
In the same way that vanity candidates use campaign Stu cell book

1645
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:18,976
Making use this to network

1646
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:23,328
And raise his stature within other right-wing spaces

1647
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:27,680
This is destined or even intended to succeed

1648
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:34,336
This is the design of pure accelerationism ignore is used to

1649
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:36,896
People who are easy to ignore

1650
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:38,432
The goal isn't to win

1651
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:43,296
He doesn't even to help a conservative or republican when it's to take over the right wing

1652
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:50,208
Anyone paying attention saw how easy it was to get the entirety of the GOP power structure to fall in line with Trump and they have to have realize

1653
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:50,976
Why is it that wasn't

1654
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:53,792
Like an isolated event that wasn't going to happen again

1655
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:58,912
If someone were able to command a similar amount of cult of personality and promise these

1656
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:00,960
GOP leaders the things they want

1657
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:04,544
They will become yeah Republicans overnight

1658
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:08,384
It's a it was dramatic how quickly that happened

1659
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:10,688
Ever underestimate the Craven

1660
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:11,712
The politician

1661
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:18,368
The goal is primarily to move the party GOP to further into

1662
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:19,392
The extreme right-wing

1663
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:24,512
And as such I think it's now time that we need to step up to the plate and take on some of this stuff

1664
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,816
Richard away from covering some folks

1665
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:31,168
It's like this for various reasons that I mentioned at the top of the episode but I'm going to reconsider that

1666
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:35,520
In terms of broadening our Wacky Wednesday crude include some of these other characters

1667
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:38,848
His priorities I believe is Nick Fuentes

1668
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:43,968
Easy just to call Nick a racist and if you Semite and that's all good and well

1669
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:47,552
And I don't think I would disagree for my taste

1670
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:48,576
I want a fuller picture

1671
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:54,208
So today what we're going to do is we're going to jump in and cover an episode of Nick show America first

1672
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:58,816
From just before he made his big splash into the Nazi adjacent big-league

1673
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:00,352
On August 11th

1674
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:01,376
2017

1675
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:07,520
This is just before he would attend the unite the right rally after which you dropped out of college and really committed himself

1676
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:10,080
Do streaming races chit from his parents

1677
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:15,712
So at this point he's on his show is being aired on the right side Broadcasting Network

1678
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:17,504
And

1679
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,808
Baeza eighteen-year-old boy

1680
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,880
A real s*** head

1681
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:23,904
But

1682
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:26,464
Even in this nascent state

1683
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:29,536
You can hear basically

1684
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:33,888
Very much of the underpinnings of the ideas that I believe he's

1685
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:39,776
Still carrying out and some of it I think applies to his behavior

1686
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:41,056
Visa Vie gay

1687
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:42,080
So I'm sorry

1688
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:42,848
Jordan

1689
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:45,408
Great I'm excited

1690
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:52,320
I'm stoked I can tell the sincerity listen to an eighteen-year-old white nationalist tell me

1691
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:53,344
Yep

1692
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,160
Here he announces that he's going to Charlotte

1693
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:57,952
First order a bit

1694
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,768
I will be at unite the right

1695
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:02,816
Finally I made the accommodation

1696
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:03,840
Oceans I made it happen

1697
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:05,888
I do a lot of

1698
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:06,656
People kept ask

1699
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,448
Over the weekend

1700
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:10,240
Nick are you going

1701
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:12,288
Unite the right I hope I'll see you at you

1702
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:13,568
The writer you coming down

1703
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:15,104
I will be

1704
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,640
Be there I will be there

1705
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:17,408
To Rally the

1706
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:18,432
Rally

1707
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:21,248
So he is he's going

1708
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,784
And we all know how that went

1709
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:23,808
Yeah it went great

1710
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:29,696
Everybody was United not just the right but the whole world

1711
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:32,768
It's like Hands Across America is great

1712
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,048
So

1713
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:38,656
Nick has some interesting thoughts actually about this rally itself

1714
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:40,704
Suspicious of it

1715
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:44,544
Because it is a Honeypot meant to trap

1716
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,312
Conservative

1717
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:47,104
Basically yeah I knew it

1718
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:47,872
I am alone

1719
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:48,640
Little bit worried as much

1720
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:49,664
Much as I am excited

1721
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:51,968
People of like mind

1722
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:53,504
Know what's going on

1723
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:54,784
That are not dumb

1724
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:56,064
Are in The Matrix

1725
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:58,112
Blue pill people that week

1726
01:28:58,368 --> 01:28:58,880
Can talk about

1727
01:28:59,136 --> 01:28:59,648
Howard Hanna

1728
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:00,672
The Country Fix

1729
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:01,440
The demography

1730
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:04,000
As excited as I am for all of that

1731
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:04,768
I'm nervous

1732
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:07,328
And this is a little bit of a shower thoughts

1733
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:09,888
You're going to have all

1734
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:11,168
The top guys

1735
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:13,216
Is the top brass all the tin pots

1736
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:17,056
You will that are going to be there all the main guys

1737
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:19,616
From the white nationalist alright

1738
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:23,712
Fringe right I don't know what you want to call it but this new faction

1739
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:24,736
That's emerge

1740
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:27,040
Obviously there's a lot of facts tables back

1741
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:28,320
I think that sort of ghost

1742
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:31,136
The territory why not unite the right

1743
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:32,160
Picture of Waldo

1744
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:35,488
I sorta thought it's

1745
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:38,816
Kind of like in that movie Inglorious Bastards which

1746
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:41,632
I watched it I liked it for a long time

1747
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:42,656
And then I hit the red

1748
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:43,424
Pella now I hate

1749
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:45,472
For obvious reasons

1750
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:48,032
Inglourious Basterds

1751
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:49,312
The end of the movie

1752
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:51,872
They get all the Nazis in one place

1753
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:53,408
And then they blow them all up

1754
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,456
And they shoot them all and they kill them all

1755
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:56,736
And I'm thinking

1756
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:58,528
You know that's sort of like

1757
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:00,576
Basically for the

1758
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:01,344
Social justice

1759
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,112
Just Warrior for

1760
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:03,136
Communist

1761
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:04,672
You know people

1762
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:05,696
Call her whatever

1763
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,000
I'm sorry thing is that not

1764
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:08,768
Exactly

1765
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:10,048
What we're doing with

1766
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:11,072
Unite the right

1767
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:12,096
Is let's point

1768
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:13,120
Every important

1769
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:14,656
Person in our movements

1770
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:15,680
In one place

1771
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:16,704
And everyone

1772
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:17,728
Sees us as a threat

1773
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:18,752
What's a civilization

1774
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:20,032
I mean isn't that

1775
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:23,104
Isn't that kind of worrisome I don't know I mean I hope I'm not

1776
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,128
Concerning people

1777
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:25,408
I'm still going to go

1778
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:26,688
You can't live your life

1779
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:27,456
Fear but

1780
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:28,736
You think of it that

1781
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:30,016
Kessler Enoch

1782
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:31,296
Spencer

1783
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:34,624
James allsup ate the last I mean like everyone's going to be there

1784
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:35,392
CMI

1785
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:36,672
Lauren southern people

1786
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:37,952
From Rebel media Argo

1787
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:41,792
I don't know is that a great idea

1788
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:46,400
Who thought it'd be a great idea like hey let's all go to Lee

1789
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:47,168
Lee Park

1790
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:48,704
Everyone thinks we're Nazi

1791
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:49,472
Season bigot

1792
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:51,776
What's the score in the middle of an open

1793
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:53,056
Winfield

1794
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:55,104
Look I understand the importance

1795
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:56,128
Prince of rallying the

1796
01:30:57,152 --> 01:30:57,664
Morale

1797
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:58,688
Uniting the right

1798
01:30:59,200 --> 01:30:59,968
That's why I'm going

1799
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:03,552
That part of it

1800
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,392
Some Nut Job some Travis

1801
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:08,672
Bickell larper

1802
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:10,720
With Sabaton 10

1803
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:12,768
Bad ideas nutjob

1804
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:16,096
It's it's interesting

1805
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:17,376
His perception

1806
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:23,776
And that is as like well I mean what better with the Nazis in

1807
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:30,176
He doesn't like it for obvious reasons very very obvious that you

1808
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:33,504
You think that we are getting all the Nazis together here too

1809
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:40,160
Yeah and you're one of that right and I mean he's talking about this new faction that's coming together and he's like the white

1810
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:42,976
White nationalist that like you will you recognize

1811
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:46,560
But this is the part a large part of this group

1812
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:48,608
Yeah Pizza that you are your night

1813
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:51,680
It's not it's not like we called you that

1814
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:52,704
You are that

1815
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:53,984
Yeah yeah

1816
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:56,032
You get it you even you get it

1817
01:31:56,288 --> 01:32:02,432
It's interesting his his leg then maybe some Nutjob will but but like I mean you don't understand

1818
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:06,528
In the movie if you think it's just some nut job there was a war and Hitler was there so

1819
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:09,344
Play that was kind of the point

1820
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:14,464
Yeah I mean if your argument is that this is a lot like that I think you're saying a lot too much

1821
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:16,512
I think you might be arguing the wrong point

1822
01:32:16,768 --> 01:32:17,280
Perhaps

1823
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:21,120
So dangerous these

1824
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:26,240
No they aren't dangerous remember the unite the right rally that happened literally immediately following this

1825
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:27,520
I do I do

1826
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:28,800
And that's why it's a little ironic

1827
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:32,128
Are portrayed in the media as the dangerous

1828
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,152
What's the violent

1829
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:34,688
We're the only piece

1830
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:36,480
People in the world

1831
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:40,064
The 10 advocate for our own interests without it being Danger

1832
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:41,344
Like

1833
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:44,928
You go to a black lives matter rally and you're not in danger of getting

1834
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:45,952
Killed by white

1835
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:47,488
You may be in danger

1836
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:50,304
White supremacist

1837
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,072
Sister Clans

1838
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:52,864
If you go to a

1839
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,144
Palestinian

1840
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:54,912
Rally

1841
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:56,448
There's no danger of

1842
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:57,216
You getting killed

1843
01:32:57,472 --> 01:33:02,592
If you go to a prose iniyot there's no danger of you getting killed by white Reaper folks your perm

1844
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:04,640
Delete your event page on face

1845
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:08,992
Facebook denies you service an Airbnb in Uber that doesn't happen

1846
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:10,016
Only happens with

1847
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:11,040
White people right

1848
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:12,320
Only when we say

1849
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:13,856
We don't want to be at

1850
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:14,880
Exterminated

1851
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:17,952
We're the only ones getting denied service revoked

1852
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:20,256
Events cancelled on Facebook

1853
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:21,280
And

1854
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:22,816
Threat of being murdered

1855
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:23,584
Bite people

1856
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:24,352
That's just

1857
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:34,080
Rally that he's promoting her hair was murdered at that rally

1858
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:36,640
A car driven by a white identity extremist

1859
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:42,784
Additionally I DeAndre Harris was brutally beaten by for rally attendees who went to prison

1860
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:45,088
And

1861
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:49,440
I mean we could we could litigate all of the violence and you know

1862
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:54,304
People who have died at various rallies but I don't think Tim would ever think Nick would like

1863
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:57,888
I don't think that would be a good use of his time

1864
01:33:58,144 --> 01:33:59,424
That's why

1865
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:01,984
Yeah.

1866
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:04,800
This is this is really uncomfortable just because he's a

1867
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:07,360
You know like this is the type of s***

1868
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:11,968
Set an 18 year old would f****** say to be edgy or some dumb s***

1869
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:12,736
Like that

1870
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:13,760
And then

1871
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:15,552
People would intervene

1872
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:16,832
Adults Whitaker

1873
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:19,904
But instead he's surrounded by adults or like

1874
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:26,048
F*** yeah dude go on bmore $1000000 also

1875
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:26,816
Yeah it's

1876
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:27,584
So

1877
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:31,936
It's unfortunate

1878
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:32,960
In some ways

1879
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:34,240
Even for him

1880
01:34:36,032 --> 01:34:39,360
Because I I think there's a lot of people went there

1881
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:41,408
17 18 19

1882
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,200
Even into your 20s

1883
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:45,504
If you are held

1884
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:46,528
To that

1885
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:48,576
For the rest of your life

1886
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:51,136
It's not necessarily Fair

1887
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:54,464
Yeah but the state that we are in

1888
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:57,024
This is the same person

1889
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,816
Yep he is not like

1890
01:34:59,072 --> 01:35:05,216
Maybe he's refined something better you'd speak about things a little bit more saveliy then he then he

1891
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:07,008
He did in 2017 but like

1892
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,544
Primarily

1893
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:12,896
It's not like oh oh I'm embarrassed to look back on myself cuz I wore

1894
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:16,224
Too many

1895
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:17,760
God help me

1896
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:18,528
What

1897
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:24,928
Items the players clothing styles I don't know

1898
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:27,488
Pop culture

1899
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:31,584
Roxette don't know what you need for me I'm here for you

1900
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:35,680
What are the things that make does on his shows that goes over the news of the day

1901
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:40,288
Big news around this time is that Google memo

1902
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:41,568
The James D'Amore

1903
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:47,968
Yeah but maybe women biologically aren't meant to be

1904
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:51,808
Give me feel people have big opinion

1905
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:54,112
And Nick

1906
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:55,648
And of course

1907
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:56,928
We're talking about this

1908
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:57,696
Google thing

1909
01:35:58,464 --> 01:35:59,232
I didn't talk about

1910
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:00,256
What is a whole lot

1911
01:36:01,024 --> 01:36:02,304
Because it was very basic

1912
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:04,096
Is a very basic subject

1913
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:05,632
Three basic topic

1914
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:08,448
To talk about it was all your usual suspects

1915
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:10,240
Warriors

1916
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:15,360
Google fired someone for saying a country opinion all that's again

1917
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:16,128
Free speech

1918
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:18,688
You know as much as I like

1919
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:20,224
A lot of a purse

1920
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:20,992
Personalities

1921
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:22,272
The outline

1922
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:23,296
New right

1923
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:24,576
A faction

1924
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:27,648
Boring it's so Blanton

1925
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:28,928
There's so many bigger

1926
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:29,696
Your things going

1927
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:31,744
You know like I was saying about

1928
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:32,768
Unite the right one

1929
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:33,792
When are people

1930
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:35,072
When white people

1931
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:37,120
Are being killed and discriminated

1932
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:37,888
It against him

1933
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:39,168
Squandered the thread of violin

1934
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:40,192
For advocating already

1935
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:41,472
You know yet

1936
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:42,752
People that are in front of Matt

1937
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:44,544
Eating about

1938
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:46,592
Social media and all that

1939
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:47,616
You know

1940
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:48,896
Just got to think of your priorities

1941
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:51,200
Yeah he's a high-minded bigger

1942
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:51,968
If you understand

1943
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:55,808
Yeah this is this is just sort of small potatoes

1944
01:36:56,064 --> 01:36:57,344
You got to look at the bigger picture

1945
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:00,672
Be racist but be ambitious about it right right

1946
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:02,720
I find it interesting that big

1947
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:04,512
Baked Within

1948
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:05,792
These white people

1949
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:06,816
Is

1950
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:07,584
A

1951
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:11,168
Kind of ironic understanding of what it takes

1952
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:14,240
For you to be the oppressed party

1953
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:15,776
Right

1954
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:17,056
So they know

1955
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:19,104
What it is that oppression is

1956
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:20,896
Right

1957
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:23,200
And they know that it's not happening

1958
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:26,272
Probably on some level you know

1959
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:28,576
So it's it is a little bit like

1960
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:30,368
I'm just

1961
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:37,280
Taking what Behavior has been done and I'm pretending that it's happening to me right there by what

1962
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:39,328
Whatever it is that I'm justifying

1963
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:40,352
Is Justified

1964
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:44,448
To do to me like they don't understand that concept

1965
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:46,752
I mean it's pretty simple

1966
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:51,616
Come out and say my political objective is to

1967
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:54,432
Make sure that my race

1968
01:37:54,688 --> 01:37:59,296
Is always in a position where we can assert Authority in all situation

1969
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:02,880
You know like that is not really a good

1970
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:09,536
You're not going to get a lot of people coming along and being like it sounds interesting

1971
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:10,304
This way

1972
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:16,704
It kinda it's it's a euphemistic in the same way that like a localization issue is way you no way the Timken

1973
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,496
Can talk about anti-Semitism without like

1974
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:21,056
Actually being upfront about what this is

1975
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:23,872
Is the same thing with Nick he's he's a busy salesman

1976
01:38:25,152 --> 01:38:30,784
I'm just I'm just saying that if they understand the consequences of their own actions then they have Justified the consequence

1977
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:32,320
That's all I'm sorry

1978
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,440
Need to understand about Nick

1979
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:39,744
In terms of his

1980
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,560
Prescriptive ideas about

1981
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:43,584
Policy

1982
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:46,144
In about like the Wayside as we ordered

1983
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:48,704
Is that he is not necessarily

1984
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:51,264
Somebody who is in the same camp as like Alex

1985
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:56,384
Who like believes on the Constitution as what happened

1986
01:38:57,664 --> 01:39:00,480
Does Mick Mick thinks that a lot of things that

1987
01:39:00,736 --> 01:39:01,504
Maybe your help

1988
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:02,784
Sacred By

1989
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:05,088
Liberalist

1990
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:08,416
Society

1991
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:10,208
Lego mascot so long

1992
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:12,256
We're told by the right-wing

1993
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:13,280
That we should be Liber

1994
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:14,048
Libertarians

1995
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:15,584
Write that

1996
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:17,632
As long as there's no sense

1997
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:19,168
As long as there's no.

1998
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:20,192
Discrimination

1999
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:21,472
Free market

2000
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:22,496
And there's free speech

2001
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:23,776
Free and open

2002
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:24,544
Society

2003
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:25,824
That's good enough

2004
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:26,848
Right

2005
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:28,896
The conservative say we should have

2006
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:29,664
The Free Press

2007
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:31,456
And we should have free

2008
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:32,736
Free speech

2009
01:39:33,248 --> 01:39:34,016
Free assembly in

2010
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:34,784
Free everything

2011
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:36,832
For a long time I was on that

2012
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:37,600
Speedway

2013
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:38,368
And I was on that

2014
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:41,184
What you looking at every

2015
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:41,952
Three instances

2016
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:42,976
Example

2017
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:44,256
Free enterprise

2018
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:45,792
You have all kinds

2019
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:46,816
Conservatives that are

2020
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:47,584
They're saying

2021
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:48,864
Well you know

2022
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:51,168
Google fire the sky

2023
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:52,448
Speaking out again

2024
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:54,496
Speaking out about obvious

2025
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:55,264
Is Biolage

2026
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:56,544
News about men and

2027
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:57,824
But

2028
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:00,384
Google the private company they can do what they want

2029
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:01,408
There's nothing we

2030
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:02,176
We can do about it

2031
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:04,224
Wright's Google surprises

2032
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:07,808
The company and so they're free to do it we may not agree with it bought that

2033
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:10,368
And God bless the free market

2034
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:11,904
I thought to myself

2035
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:13,440
That is

2036
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:14,976
True in every inch

2037
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:16,512
The tution where we have these

2038
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:17,280
These dummies

2039
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:18,304
On the right

2040
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:19,840
Dummy conservative

2041
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:21,888
Did all the advocate for is

2042
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:25,984
Free openness open Freedom whatever libertine libertarian

2043
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:29,056
And we always get

2044
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:30,848
Screwed every time with everything

2045
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:35,968
Free enterprise doesn't really involve whether or not Google should have fired James D'Amore

2046
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:41,088
Nick wants a dictatorship but that isn't really a coherent

2047
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:42,624
D'Amore's memo is s***

2048
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:48,000
And even the National Labor Board found after an investigation that his firing was completely legal and appropriate

2049
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:54,144
He argues that their innate biological traits that make women less employed in the tech field in a Google and this has an effect

2050
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:57,216
Creating a hostile work environment for folks and it wasn't protected

2051
01:40:59,008 --> 01:41:00,800
I don't I don't know but you get this

2052
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:06,176
This Revelation through discussing this story that like no f***** there should be

2053
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:10,784
The government should be controlling the economy

2054
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:14,368
Even in hiring and firing decisions

2055
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:18,720
If

2056
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:19,744
Hawaiian tattoos

2057
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,536
Dictator then he would tell

2058
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:22,560
Corporation

2059
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:24,352
Who they can hire and Fire

2060
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:26,400
You can't that's a good

2061
01:41:26,656 --> 01:41:30,752
If you can't fire people for creating a hostile work environment for

2062
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:34,336
A certain group of staff

2063
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:38,432
That's no do you do get to do that if I were a white man

2064
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:42,272
I've got a room I've got a new rule that I think works perfectly

2065
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:43,296
Okay okay

2066
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:47,136
You cannot talk to me about chromosome

2067
01:41:47,904 --> 01:41:48,672
Unless you know what

2068
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:49,440
All of them

2069
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:55,328
So if you're going to tell me there's a biological difference that you can pinpoint between an X and A Y

2070
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:58,144
Define you also have to tell me about the other 24

2071
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:04,544
Every single f****** one of them and if you don't know s*** about the other 24 that shut the f****** about the two of you do know about

2072
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,592
This one here is a library

2073
01:42:06,848 --> 01:42:12,992
See that's what works in construction

2074
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:16,832
This one is an artist absolutely

2075
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:19,904
Starrybay all do as a professional 12

2076
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:25,280
Yeah I don't know what the girls want to

2077
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:29,632
Spa there's like that there's the the ones that are like how much hair do you have

2078
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:30,656
I remember that one

2079
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:34,240
So in addition to like not being into this free-enterprise stuff

2080
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:36,544
He's also not into free speech

2081
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:37,824
He does not

2082
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:38,848
Think it matter

2083
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:40,128
Free speech

2084
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:42,432
You're all the college kids in Berkeley

2085
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:43,200
Play Marching for

2086
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:44,224
Free speech in the six

2087
01:42:44,736 --> 01:42:45,504
Once they got it

2088
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:46,272
I control that

2089
01:42:46,528 --> 01:42:48,576
No free speech for white people

2090
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:49,856
Free enterprise

2091
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:51,904
There's no discrimination Allowed by the mark

2092
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:52,672
Because

2093
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:56,000
Costly to a business we should open up the free markets

2094
01:42:56,256 --> 01:42:56,768
You can only do

2095
01:42:57,024 --> 01:42:57,536
Discriminate against

2096
01:42:57,792 --> 01:42:58,304
White people

2097
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,328
In the market play

2098
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:02,144
Freedom of the press

2099
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:06,240
We can talk about anything in the press as long as we get a free press we can happen

2100
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:07,520
Information and everything is

2101
01:43:08,032 --> 01:43:11,872
And information revolution with the Internet only people that are discriminated against

2102
01:43:12,128 --> 01:43:12,640
White people

2103
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:13,408
One state

2104
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:16,224
Animal Control

2105
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:17,760
Folks take a look

2106
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:18,784
Take a look at okay

2107
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:19,552
Control some right

2108
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:20,832
The globalist

2109
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:22,368
And I

2110
01:43:22,624 --> 01:43:23,648
I just think it's so funny that

2111
01:43:23,904 --> 01:43:25,952
You have so many people young people in parts

2112
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:26,976
Particular add baffles

2113
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:29,024
That are still championing this

2114
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:30,304
Hedonistic

2115
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:33,888
Ridiculous libertarian cause that only hurts our

2116
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:36,960
So it is important

2117
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:43,360
The point is that every time that makes his globalist he's smiling and doing like a little bit of a week

2118
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:44,384
He knows we all know

2119
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:47,456
It's debatable whether or not

2120
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:50,272
Or at least how consistently Alex

2121
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:53,344
Is using that euphemistically for Jewish people

2122
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:58,208
It is not as pretty transparent that he's winking

2123
01:43:58,464 --> 01:44:00,256
Yeah you know what I'm talking about

2124
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:04,352
You know why I don't like in glorious bastards staff

2125
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:07,424
Okay so if I was a fascist dictator

2126
01:44:07,936 --> 01:44:08,448
Alright

2127
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:11,264
I'm not giving a s*** about hiring and firing people whatever

2128
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:12,032
Bye-bye bye-bye

2129
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:13,312
Not my job

2130
01:44:13,568 --> 01:44:16,896
Shrike that seems like a tough to micromanage the only thing I'm doing

2131
01:44:17,152 --> 01:44:18,688
Is I'm going to create

2132
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:19,456
A

2133
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:21,760
What I'm going to call it a do it to you

2134
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:26,880
Right so everything else the government can do whatever they want but I've this is my baby

2135
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:27,648
Alright

2136
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:29,696
And that every time somebody's like

2137
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:32,000
All right Bubba going to like 20

2138
01:44:32,256 --> 01:44:33,536
Then he goes to the dude

2139
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:36,096
Do you camp and then all the things that he wants

2140
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:36,864
Get done to him

2141
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:43,264
And then we figure it out you know what they will see how he turns out on the other side of the maybe fascism is bad

2142
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:50,432
Yeah support either you becoming a dictator or this place well particular

2143
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:52,736
Second one really undercuts the first one

2144
01:44:52,992 --> 01:44:53,504
Sure

2145
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:55,296
So did the

2146
01:44:55,808 --> 01:44:56,320
It's it's

2147
01:44:56,576 --> 01:45:00,160
Interesting to me the way that these assertions are just made and

2148
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:02,464
Like there is no evidence

2149
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:04,512
Or anyting presented for like

2150
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:05,536
You can only have

2151
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:11,936
Free Speech white people

2152
01:45:12,192 --> 01:45:13,216
Bieber

2153
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:15,520
Discriminatory against white people

2154
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:17,568
I get just seems like a whiner

2155
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:23,968
Yeah well I mean Debate Club like repeats the certain keywords that you know

2156
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:25,248
Who can happen

2157
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:26,016
White people

2158
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:32,416
White people who disagree don't really matter they're not your audience

2159
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:38,816
Like agree with this already or the people you or hoping you suck in that sack generally speaking

2160
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:39,584
Cancer Network

2161
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:40,864
Pretty good chance that

2162
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:42,400
That's who's going to be watching

2163
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:47,264
So make as an interesting metaphor here about

2164
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:48,800
I guess the races

2165
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:51,360
This is dumb The Wacky Races

2166
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:52,896
Nope nope

2167
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:56,480
Think of it like this

2168
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:58,528
Think of it I made the analogy on the show

2169
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:00,320
It's like a soccer

2170
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:01,600
Okay

2171
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:02,368
And one

2172
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:04,416
What's call it

2173
01:46:04,672 --> 01:46:05,184
The color teal

2174
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:06,464
The black team

2175
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:08,768
Well you've already started wrong

2176
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:10,560
Black team is there

2177
01:46:11,328 --> 01:46:12,352
Soccer they were black

2178
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:14,144
They don't play by the rules

2179
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:15,168
They pick the ball up

2180
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:15,936
With their hands

2181
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:17,216
And they throw it in the neck

2182
01:46:17,472 --> 01:46:18,240
And they only passed

2183
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:19,008
To each other

2184
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:19,776
I need

2185
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:21,312
They run in the middle of the field

2186
01:46:21,568 --> 01:46:23,360
Play pick up the ball and then they throw it in the neck

2187
01:46:23,616 --> 01:46:25,664
And then they take it out and they throw it in the neck

2188
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:26,944
And they take it out and then

2189
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:28,736
Throw it in the net and they're winning

2190
01:46:28,992 --> 01:46:29,504
Running up

2191
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:30,528
The scoreboard

2192
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:33,088
You know you don't see high scores and soccer cuz it

2193
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:35,904
But you're seeing

2194
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:37,952
100 105 200b

2195
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:40,256
And throwing it in the neck

2196
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:41,792
They're not playing by the rules

2197
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:43,328
They're not playing at 6

2198
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:44,608
They're not playing

2199
01:46:44,864 --> 01:46:45,376
Fairly

2200
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:47,680
You're not playing by the rules

2201
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:49,216
They pick it up they throw it in the neck

2202
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:51,008
And let's just say hi

2203
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:52,032
Statically the other two

2204
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:53,568
The white tea

2205
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:54,848
They're wearing white jerseys

2206
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:56,640
They're just getting mad about

2207
01:46:57,152 --> 01:46:58,688
They're just sitting on the sidelines

2208
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:00,480
With their hands on their hips

2209
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:01,760
Saying hey

2210
01:47:02,272 --> 01:47:03,040
That's not

2211
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:05,600
That's there that's not playing by the rules black tea

2212
01:47:06,112 --> 01:47:06,880
You can't pick it up with you

2213
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:08,416
In the net

2214
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:10,720
That's not by the rules look at our rulebook

2215
01:47:11,232 --> 01:47:12,768
It goes against Article 1

2216
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:14,560
Section whatever of the rulebook

2217
01:47:15,072 --> 01:47:16,608
And you're not playing by the rules in

2218
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:18,144
We're not going to let this happen

2219
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:20,192
And they said they're with their he

2220
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:22,240
And black team just

2221
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:25,056
Throw it in the data they are running up the scoreboard

2222
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:28,128
And white team say hey I don't like that so much

2223
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:29,664
Except

2224
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:30,432
Here's the death

2225
01:47:30,688 --> 01:47:31,200
Difference in the real way

2226
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:33,760
It doesn't matter how you get the point

2227
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:34,784
It just matters that you

2228
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:35,552
Get the points

2229
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:36,832
And the loser dies

2230
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:37,600
The loser is

2231
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:38,624
Exterminated

2232
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:40,928
Once they get to a point where the blacktop

2233
01:47:41,184 --> 01:47:41,952
Team gets a huge lead

2234
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:43,488
Last text

2235
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:44,768
And that space

2236
01:47:45,024 --> 01:47:45,792
Sickly the world were living

2237
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:46,560
And I don't have to

2238
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:47,584
Spell out the analogy

2239
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:49,120
But that's basically

2240
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:50,912
Which is

2241
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:53,216
You have people on white team that are saying

2242
01:47:53,472 --> 01:47:55,264
Let's do whatever it takes to win

2243
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:57,312
And then everyone else on the White

2244
01:47:57,824 --> 01:47:58,336
Saying

2245
01:47:58,592 --> 01:48:01,920
No that's not fair we have to play by the rules with will not play until every

2246
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:02,944
Plays by the rules

2247
01:48:03,456 --> 01:48:04,736
And you understand what happened

2248
01:48:05,504 --> 01:48:06,784
White team they have the rule book

2249
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:09,344
White team may have played ethically they were

2250
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:11,392
We're so moral

2251
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:13,952
They were so virtuous they talked about

2252
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:15,232
The universal

2253
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:16,768
Brotherhood of soccer

2254
01:48:17,024 --> 01:48:18,048
Players and Howard

2255
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:20,096
It's all just about soccer

2256
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:21,632
I'm playing the game

2257
01:48:22,144 --> 01:48:22,912
But then they all

2258
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:24,192
He killed in the parking lot

2259
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:26,240
Whatever we decide to go home

2260
01:48:27,008 --> 01:48:28,032
And that's the world we live in

2261
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:29,568
That's the world we live in

2262
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:30,336
Can I

2263
01:48:30,592 --> 01:48:32,384
Let me try a soccer metaphor

2264
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:36,224
It's like let's take one team for the sake of argument the white tea

2265
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:38,528
All right now on this soccer pitch

2266
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:40,832
Let's say the white team has

2267
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:42,112
Several hundred player

2268
01:48:42,368 --> 01:48:48,512
Marcelo Balboa Mineola

2269
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:50,304
Five people in gold right

2270
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:52,608
And then the black team has about 10 people

2271
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:54,656
Alright and then the white team

2272
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:55,424
Steele's

2273
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:57,216
The black teams

2274
01:48:57,472 --> 01:48:57,984
Heron

2275
01:48:58,240 --> 01:48:58,752
Balls

2276
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:05,408
Take those away from them and then their grandparents balls to take those away from them so they've got all these millions of balls in there just

2277
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:08,480
Fire Matt the golf but then the black team scores one goal

2278
01:49:08,736 --> 01:49:12,064
Until the white team goes f****** games

2279
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:18,464
Trump to be president it's interesting that neither of your metaphors really make sense in terms of soccer

2280
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:22,048
Yeah

2281
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:25,888
I would like to ask make some follow-up question

2282
01:49:26,144 --> 01:49:27,680
Since the first Ruby what are the point

2283
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:29,216
In this metaphor

2284
01:49:29,472 --> 01:49:30,496
Like what

2285
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:32,544
Stand for literally right

2286
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:35,104
I believe he's literally talking about rights

2287
01:49:35,616 --> 01:49:36,384
Those are the points

2288
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:38,688
That's weird yeah

2289
01:49:38,944 --> 01:49:40,224
I mean I don't know

2290
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:42,272
I don't know what 9 a.m.

2291
01:49:42,528 --> 01:49:47,904
Just win or lose it's hard to it's hard to really respond to his metaphor because I don't understand what the

2292
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:48,928
The goals are

2293
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:50,976
Scoring mean

2294
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:55,584
I don't know who the wraps are the rafts

2295
01:49:56,608 --> 01:49:57,632
Cuz I mean like

2296
01:49:58,144 --> 01:49:58,656
You know

2297
01:49:59,424 --> 01:50:00,704
If they were there I would guess

2298
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:03,008
That they're just giving yellow and red cards

2299
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:09,408
To the white team yeah I mean they must like Nick cuz he speaks too much truth to get Silo cars clothes and I guess that means

2300
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:15,808
It's like getting kicked off Twitter maybe maybe that's what the refs are maybe the rest are like jaxi I think he loses the metal

2301
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:22,208
Four at the end when he's like and then everyone dies in the parking lot

2302
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:25,536
What about the game so much as you just want to kill everyone that you don't like

2303
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:31,168
No because he's saying that they are going to be the subject of the Killer

2304
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:33,216
Right but he's only saying that because he

2305
01:50:33,728 --> 01:50:35,264
Wants them to be the Opera

2306
01:50:36,032 --> 01:50:42,176
Right cuz there's in his metaphor there's only two teams right and I'm one of them is getting hurted in the parking lot one of the members on the

2307
01:50:42,432 --> 01:50:47,040
The white team who sang we shouldn't play by the rules know the parking lot

2308
01:50:47,552 --> 01:50:48,832
Musically yes

2309
01:50:49,856 --> 01:50:50,368
Not good

2310
01:50:50,624 --> 01:50:52,416
Target metaphor

2311
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:55,232
I mentioned it doesn't like free speech

2312
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,280
And ironically

2313
01:50:58,304 --> 01:50:58,816
What the moral of

2314
01:50:59,072 --> 01:50:59,584
The story The t

2315
01:51:00,096 --> 01:51:00,608
The moment is

2316
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:02,912
Idea

2317
01:51:05,728 --> 01:51:06,496
Is an

2318
01:51:07,264 --> 01:51:08,032
It's not the end

2319
01:51:08,544 --> 01:51:09,312
Itself we use free

2320
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:10,848
As anarki

2321
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:11,872
I meant as a tool to

2322
01:51:12,128 --> 01:51:12,896
The further our own inch

2323
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:14,176
We use free

2324
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:16,224
Free speech to get these guys to play by

2325
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:17,760
Their own rules to hold the

2326
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:18,528
Themselves

2327
01:51:20,064 --> 01:51:20,832
But we're not after

2328
01:51:21,856 --> 01:51:22,880
Self or not after

2329
01:51:23,136 --> 01:51:23,904
Total an Absol

2330
01:51:24,416 --> 01:51:25,184
Freedom in itself

2331
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:25,952
Of course not

2332
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:27,232
Because every time that we

2333
01:51:27,488 --> 01:51:28,256
We do get this total

2334
01:51:29,536 --> 01:51:30,048
We get

2335
01:51:30,304 --> 01:51:30,816
Certain groups

2336
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:31,584
People

2337
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:33,888
Use it and through unfair

2338
01:51:34,144 --> 01:51:35,936
Advantages and strategies

2339
01:51:36,192 --> 01:51:37,728
They climb to the top and use it

2340
01:51:37,984 --> 01:51:38,752
To their own advantage

2341
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:39,776
We're talking about

2342
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:40,544
The globalist

2343
01:51:41,824 --> 01:51:42,336
And so

2344
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:43,872
That's why

2345
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:44,896
We have to

2346
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:46,176
Play for our own team

2347
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:46,944
Finally

2348
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:49,248
This Google thing

2349
01:51:50,272 --> 01:51:50,784
Teaches us that

2350
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:52,576
The argument is Liberty

2351
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:53,856
But not for Liberty

2352
01:51:55,904 --> 01:51:56,416
Itself not as

2353
01:51:56,672 --> 01:51:57,184
Is an enzymatic

2354
01:51:57,952 --> 01:51:59,232
The further our own intro

2355
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,560
This is a great moment to understand Nick a little bit better

2356
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:09,216
Don't first second trust that something he's saying necessarily has to be sincere because there's a very good chance that something

2357
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:14,336
He's pursuing is actually just a red herring and is part of something else entirely namely

2358
01:52:14,592 --> 01:52:16,384
Advancing is white identity agenda

2359
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:20,480
What Nick is doing is echoing the ideology of his forefathers

2360
01:52:20,736 --> 01:52:24,320
Particularly George Lincoln Rockwell the founder of the American Nazi party

2361
01:52:24,832 --> 01:52:30,720
Rockwell would go to college campuses and cause a scene in game free press coverage under the banner of free speech

2362
01:52:30,976 --> 01:52:32,256
But the goal was really spreading

2363
01:52:32,512 --> 01:52:33,536
Is Nazi ideas

2364
01:52:34,048 --> 01:52:36,608
The Free Speech part isn't important to them at all

2365
01:52:36,864 --> 01:52:38,144
On the basis of it being a prince

2366
01:52:38,912 --> 01:52:44,288
Gladly cross the speech rights of people they didn't like were they in charge but they know that they can

2367
01:52:44,544 --> 01:52:49,408
Cry free speech in order to mask what their rallies and ideologies are actually about

2368
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:51,968
This trend is really consistent on the right wing

2369
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:55,040
I think about how all the anti lockdown protests

2370
01:52:55,296 --> 01:53:01,440
What happened over the last two years were really bored let's just radicalization points for anti-vaxxers spread their idea

2371
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:03,488
The far-right

2372
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:07,328
Has an internal awareness that their ideas are things that most people hate

2373
01:53:07,584 --> 01:53:09,120
So they need the Trojan Horse them

2374
01:53:09,376 --> 01:53:09,888
Two people

2375
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:16,288
Presenting your ideas as they actually exist as a sure path to rejection so you use universally approved concert

2376
01:53:16,544 --> 01:53:17,312
Steps like free speech

2377
01:53:17,568 --> 01:53:20,384
As a mask that your actual ideology hidebehind

2378
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:23,968
Make a pretty pretty open about

2379
01:53:24,224 --> 01:53:27,552
No I mean it's fun it's it is like an it's like a team

2380
01:53:27,808 --> 01:53:30,880
Listening to all of the adults lie and going well

2381
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:32,928
I get what you're saying see

2382
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:36,512
I'm telling you what you're saying that's what you're saying

2383
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:37,536
Why aren't you saying

2384
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:39,584
Like it's made very simple

2385
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:40,864
Well honestly it's like

2386
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:43,168
He's not coming up with ideas

2387
01:53:45,472 --> 01:53:49,312
No not necessarily at this stage I would not say that he is a necessary

2388
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:50,336
He is

2389
01:53:50,592 --> 01:53:53,664
Demonstrating a pretty Keen awareness of these

2390
01:53:54,176 --> 01:53:55,712
Underlying tactic

2391
01:53:56,224 --> 01:54:00,320
That people used to push people further right

2392
01:54:00,576 --> 01:54:04,160
He's he's articulating them in a way that is

2393
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:09,024
Jermaine too and consistent with his behavior since

2394
01:54:10,048 --> 01:54:11,840
So I think is worth

2395
01:54:12,096 --> 01:54:12,608
Understand

2396
01:54:14,144 --> 01:54:18,240
It's f***** up and away because it's very clear that he sees through the b*******

2397
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:19,264
It's just

2398
01:54:19,776 --> 01:54:20,800
Bet he's mad

2399
01:54:21,056 --> 01:54:21,568
About it

2400
01:54:21,824 --> 01:54:22,592
Like he's like

2401
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:28,736
Why are we lying all the time can't we just tell people that we want to kill the ones we don't like

2402
01:54:28,992 --> 01:54:30,272
Can't we just

2403
01:54:30,528 --> 01:54:32,320
Exert power with power

2404
01:54:32,576 --> 01:54:35,392
Charade

2405
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:36,160
Free speech

2406
01:54:36,416 --> 01:54:37,184
Except he's not

2407
01:54:37,696 --> 01:54:38,208
Stop saying that

2408
01:54:38,464 --> 01:54:40,768
He is not saying we use these tools

2409
01:54:41,024 --> 01:54:44,096
Because we need to in order to get to the point where we can kill

2410
01:54:44,352 --> 01:54:45,632
People we don't like in the parking lot

2411
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:46,912
Exactly

2412
01:54:47,168 --> 01:54:48,192
So I mean that's

2413
01:54:48,448 --> 01:54:49,728
Let me know in parties

2414
01:54:49,984 --> 01:54:51,264
Clearly understands the strategy

2415
01:54:52,288 --> 01:54:55,104
So you get to talk a little bit about women in the workplace

2416
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:56,384
And what have you got

2417
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:00,480
What's the other 24 chromosomes do

2418
01:55:00,736 --> 01:55:02,016
Can you try and tell them this like

2419
01:55:02,272 --> 01:55:02,784
Hey you know

2420
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:03,552
Sweetheart

2421
01:55:03,808 --> 01:55:04,320
I know you

2422
01:55:04,576 --> 01:55:05,344
You feel really passed

2423
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:06,112
What about this

2424
01:55:07,136 --> 01:55:07,904
The attention of some

2425
01:55:08,416 --> 01:55:09,440
Chad College Republicans

2426
01:55:10,208 --> 01:55:10,720
Frat party

2427
01:55:12,256 --> 01:55:13,536
But if you really want to save

2428
01:55:13,792 --> 01:55:14,816
The country if you want it

2429
01:55:15,328 --> 01:55:16,864
Fulfill your moral obligation

2430
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:17,888
To your country and

2431
01:55:18,144 --> 01:55:18,656
People

2432
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:20,448
You should be getting married and having

2433
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:21,472
10 or 50

2434
01:55:21,728 --> 01:55:22,240
Teen children

2435
01:55:22,496 --> 01:55:23,264
And you will be

2436
01:55:23,776 --> 01:55:24,544
By the way

2437
01:55:25,312 --> 01:55:27,872
And know that is no small order either

2438
01:55:28,384 --> 01:55:29,920
You will be the backbone of

2439
01:55:30,176 --> 01:55:31,456
The country of the

2440
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:32,992
As a good mother

2441
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:35,040
But they all want to fight you on this

2442
01:55:35,296 --> 01:55:35,808
Miss everyone wants to

2443
01:55:36,064 --> 01:55:36,576
To fight you on this

2444
01:55:39,904 --> 01:55:40,416
Save that

2445
01:55:40,672 --> 01:55:41,952
That's just not realistic

2446
01:55:42,464 --> 01:55:42,976
That's not with the tie

2447
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,048
And everything's going so well right

2448
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:52,448
It's totally fine if people choose to be Homemakers but the option to pursue whatever work they want is pretty critical to a

2449
01:55:52,704 --> 01:55:53,728
Free world like

2450
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:55,008
Dates

2451
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:56,288
Sexist

2452
01:55:56,544 --> 01:55:59,104
Misogynist to say that women have to do that

2453
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:01,664
The people make but anyway

2454
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:08,320
Not not for nothing a major element of Nazi propaganda involved women reproducing more white babies and how that was

2455
01:56:08,576 --> 01:56:10,624
The Cornerstone of building the third right

2456
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:12,160
The word called

2457
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:14,976
The cross of honor of the German mother two women who had

2458
01:56:15,232 --> 01:56:16,256
For more children

2459
01:56:16,768 --> 01:56:19,840
That's what Nick is hearkening to with this message it's pretty clear

2460
01:56:20,096 --> 01:56:25,728
He goes on to talk a bit more about this later to just like really strongly about his feelings about like

2461
01:56:25,984 --> 01:56:29,056
You need to have seven children and then they want you then

2462
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:33,920
7 children who will also give birth to seven children

2463
01:56:34,176 --> 01:56:36,224
That are all conservative

2464
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:37,504
Right

2465
01:56:38,784 --> 01:56:40,064
It's a little

2466
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:43,392
First of all it is harkening back to that ideology

2467
01:56:43,648 --> 01:56:46,208
Replacement

2468
01:56:46,464 --> 01:56:47,232
I mean because

2469
01:56:47,744 --> 01:56:49,280
How many people do we know who have

2470
01:56:49,536 --> 01:56:50,816
Conservative parents who are

2471
01:56:51,072 --> 01:56:56,960
Quite liberal guarantee that just because you even if you have a tightly-controlled

2472
01:56:57,216 --> 01:56:59,264
Controlled family system

2473
01:56:59,776 --> 01:57:01,056
Doesn't make it like

2474
01:57:01,312 --> 01:57:04,128
Any more likely that your children are going to end up

2475
01:57:04,384 --> 01:57:09,504
Having your exact same ideology and that's why it would be nice if everybody understood

2476
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:14,368
Is it that when you try and implement the things that these right right-wing people think

2477
01:57:14,624 --> 01:57:15,392
Will happen

2478
01:57:16,416 --> 01:57:19,232
We get crazy weird unintended consequences

2479
01:57:19,488 --> 01:57:22,816
That nobody understood or expected to happen like for instance

2480
01:57:23,072 --> 01:57:26,400
I don't know say the covid response being

2481
01:57:26,656 --> 01:57:29,472
Letter f****** rip from half of our goddamn country

2482
01:57:29,728 --> 01:57:32,800
There's a lot of things that are unintended because they have

2483
01:57:33,056 --> 01:57:34,080
Terrible ideas

2484
01:57:34,336 --> 01:57:34,848
Yeah

2485
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:38,432
Nick believes that racism is all around him

2486
01:57:38,944 --> 01:57:39,456
I can't swipe

2487
01:57:39,712 --> 01:57:45,856
I think you would believe that he decides he's going to bring up a really prime example of that

2488
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:48,160
And for everyone that doubts me

2489
01:57:48,928 --> 01:57:49,696
For people like my mom

2490
01:57:49,952 --> 01:57:50,464
Who Doubt Me On

2491
01:57:50,976 --> 01:57:51,488
To think I'm some

2492
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:52,768
Racist bigot

2493
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:53,792
Because I want my P

2494
01:57:54,304 --> 01:57:55,072
To stay alive

2495
01:57:55,328 --> 01:57:56,352
Mom's cafe in here

2496
01:57:56,864 --> 01:57:57,888
You turn the show off

2497
01:57:58,400 --> 01:57:59,424
Around him

2498
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:01,216
Clipper from being racing

2499
01:58:05,568 --> 01:58:06,848
You think that's all fine and well we just

2500
01:58:07,104 --> 01:58:07,616
Just need to have an open

2501
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:10,176
Do me a favor right now if you're watching

2502
01:58:10,432 --> 01:58:10,944
In the show on you

2503
01:58:11,712 --> 01:58:12,224
Click

2504
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:14,784
On the top right open a new tab

2505
01:58:15,552 --> 01:58:17,344
In this window open a new tab

2506
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:18,624
Go into Google

2507
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:19,392
And I want you

2508
01:58:19,648 --> 01:58:20,416
Google for me

2509
01:58:20,672 --> 01:58:21,696
American

2510
01:58:21,952 --> 01:58:22,464
Inventor

2511
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:25,024
If you don't believe me if you think I'm pedaling

2512
01:58:28,096 --> 01:58:28,608
Has Barack Obama

2513
01:58:29,632 --> 01:58:30,400
I'm making this up if

2514
01:58:30,656 --> 01:58:31,168
If you think I'm

2515
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:34,240
Some white supremacist sunken Spanish

2516
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:35,520
I will demonstrate to you

2517
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:39,872
Click open the new tab and Google American Adventure

2518
01:58:40,384 --> 01:58:41,152
Tell me who comes

2519
01:58:42,432 --> 01:58:42,944
Tell me

2520
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:45,760
Google, pin that Google search when you Google

2521
01:58:46,016 --> 01:58:46,784
American Adventure

2522
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:47,552
Tell me

2523
01:58:48,832 --> 01:58:49,856
Does Benjamin

2524
01:58:50,112 --> 01:58:50,624
Come up

2525
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:52,928
Does

2526
01:58:53,184 --> 01:58:54,208
Nikola Tesla Mike

2527
01:58:54,464 --> 01:58:55,232
Come up he might not

2528
01:58:56,768 --> 01:58:57,536
What do

2529
01:58:57,792 --> 01:58:58,304
What do

2530
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:01,888
Just about every single one of the results to come up and Google have

2531
01:59:03,424 --> 01:59:05,216
Weird was it their miraculous

2532
01:59:05,984 --> 01:59:07,264
What's a thermal miraculous

2533
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:08,544
Influential Adventure

2534
01:59:09,312 --> 01:59:09,824
No that's

2535
01:59:10,592 --> 01:59:11,360
That they have

2536
01:59:12,384 --> 01:59:12,896
George Washing

2537
01:59:13,408 --> 01:59:14,176
Carver before they have

2538
01:59:14,432 --> 01:59:14,944
Have time to status

2539
01:59:15,712 --> 01:59:16,224
You know that can't be

2540
01:59:16,992 --> 01:59:17,504
G1

2541
01:59:18,528 --> 01:59:19,296
Who are they deliver

2542
01:59:19,552 --> 01:59:20,320
Really excluding from

2543
01:59:21,856 --> 01:59:22,880
Or they deliberately

2544
01:59:23,648 --> 01:59:24,928
Revising history

2545
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:26,208
To exclude

2546
01:59:26,464 --> 01:59:27,488
So just one thing

2547
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:33,888
Tesla was born in Croatia

2548
01:59:34,144 --> 01:59:38,240
Will be counted as an American inventor

2549
01:59:38,496 --> 01:59:44,640
Yeah for other raps

2550
01:59:44,896 --> 01:59:47,456
But whether or not you she's an American Adventure

2551
01:59:47,712 --> 01:59:50,016
View thing but Nick is concerned with his that he's white

2552
01:59:50,272 --> 01:59:53,088
Nick is going to Google inventors

2553
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:59,744
And let's see he's going to do it let's onscreen for us a little game of races

2554
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,048
Brian and f****** Geraldo that

2555
02:00:02,304 --> 02:00:08,448
Safe man it's a terrible idea it's not going to go well could make is probably better at presentation that Owen is

2556
02:00:11,264 --> 02:00:11,776
And who do we have

2557
02:00:12,544 --> 02:00:13,312
George Washing

2558
02:00:13,824 --> 02:00:14,336
Carver he's

2559
02:00:15,104 --> 02:00:16,384
Results when you think of America

2560
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:17,152
Adventure

2561
02:00:17,408 --> 02:00:18,176
Think of George

2562
02:00:18,432 --> 02:00:20,480
We eat peanuts

2563
02:00:20,736 --> 02:00:21,760
Howard Latimer

2564
02:00:22,784 --> 02:00:23,552
One of my favorites

2565
02:00:24,064 --> 02:00:24,832
Definitely hero

2566
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:27,392
Garrett Morgan yes

2567
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:28,928
Garrett Morgan

2568
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:30,208
Can't remember which

2569
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:32,512
Elijah Wood

2570
02:00:32,768 --> 02:00:33,536
McCoy

2571
02:00:35,072 --> 02:00:35,584
Annabelle

2572
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:36,864
Madam Walker

2573
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:39,936
Doesn't ring a bell Okay so

2574
02:00:40,448 --> 02:00:40,960
First five

2575
02:00:41,728 --> 02:00:42,240
Five entries

2576
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:44,288
I've heard of one of them

2577
02:00:45,312 --> 02:00:45,824
Don't know any

2578
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:46,592
If their invention

2579
02:00:46,848 --> 02:00:47,360
Well let's keep

2580
02:00:47,872 --> 02:00:48,384
It's all final

2581
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:49,408
Thomas Edison

2582
02:00:49,664 --> 02:00:50,176
Of course

2583
02:00:50,688 --> 02:00:52,480
Thomas Edison invented the light bulb

2584
02:00:52,992 --> 02:00:53,760
Like 100

2585
02:00:54,016 --> 02:00:56,320
Things probably one of the greatest Adventure

2586
02:00:56,576 --> 02:00:57,344
Pictures of all time

2587
02:00:59,136 --> 02:00:59,648
Number 6

2588
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:01,696
He hides Elijah McCoy

2589
02:01:02,464 --> 02:01:03,488
Madam Walker

2590
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:05,792
Latimer

2591
02:01:08,864 --> 02:01:09,632
After Edison

2592
02:01:09,888 --> 02:01:10,400
Can you have

2593
02:01:10,656 --> 02:01:11,424
Lonnie Johnson

2594
02:01:11,936 --> 02:01:13,472
Oh good old Lonnie Johnson

2595
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:16,544
Granville Woods

2596
02:01:17,312 --> 02:01:18,336
Patricia bath

2597
02:01:18,848 --> 02:01:19,616
Jan Ernst

2598
02:01:20,384 --> 02:01:20,896
Mets

2599
02:01:21,152 --> 02:01:21,664
Sliger

2600
02:01:29,344 --> 02:01:30,880
We have an all of those

2601
02:01:31,136 --> 02:01:32,160
Even want to start

2602
02:01:32,416 --> 02:01:33,440
Every single one black

2603
02:01:34,976 --> 02:01:35,488
Two white guys

2604
02:01:38,816 --> 02:01:39,328
Coincidence

2605
02:01:39,584 --> 02:01:40,096
Does that make sense

2606
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:47,264
I have no idea what list he's looking at but I decided to play along with him and according to my Google results I don't know if they've changed

2607
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:49,312
2017 or whatever but

2608
02:01:49,568 --> 02:01:54,688
The first names that come up are Thomas Edison Samuel Morris Robert Fulton and Alexander Graham Bell

2609
02:01:54,944 --> 02:01:55,712
All white dudes

2610
02:01:55,968 --> 02:01:57,504
Emmanuel George Washington Carver

2611
02:01:57,760 --> 02:02:02,880
I don't know what list he's looking at so I can't really respond to it specifically B seems like bulshit

2612
02:02:03,136 --> 02:02:07,232
A larger issue with his blanket disregard and disrespect for black inventors

2613
02:02:07,488 --> 02:02:09,280
He doesn't know who any of these people are which

2614
02:02:09,536 --> 02:02:15,680
Makes the opposite argument than what I think Nick is intending no one knows about these people

2615
02:02:15,936 --> 02:02:16,704
But what did they invent

2616
02:02:17,472 --> 02:02:19,520
Garrett Morgan invented the traffic light

2617
02:02:19,776 --> 02:02:24,128
The smoke Hood would you like firefighters to withstand smoke exposure and still be able to breathe

2618
02:02:24,640 --> 02:02:28,736
Lewis Latimer work for Addison and actually holds the patent for electric lamp

2619
02:02:29,504 --> 02:02:31,808
He also invented one of the early forms of air conditioner

2620
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:38,208
Elijah McCoy invented the automatic lubricator for steam engines centrally revolutionising railroad travel

2621
02:02:38,464 --> 02:02:40,000
Both in terms of Civilian use

2622
02:02:40,256 --> 02:02:41,792
As well as for commercial purposes

2623
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:48,448
Madame Walker is remembered as the first female self-made millionaire u.s. history and develop Hair Care Systems

2624
02:02:48,704 --> 02:02:49,216
For black women

2625
02:02:49,728 --> 02:02:53,824
Lonnie Johnson invented the Super Soaker one of the best selling toys of all time

2626
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:54,592
Does work

2627
02:02:54,848 --> 02:02:55,872
Developing Tech

2628
02:02:56,128 --> 02:02:58,944
While working at Nasa as an engineer on spaceships

2629
02:02:59,456 --> 02:03:05,600
Granville Woods invented automatic brakes the steam boiler furnace and a raft of other railroad related things

2630
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:09,696
He's often called the black Edison but I guess Nick hasn't heard of him

2631
02:03:10,208 --> 02:03:13,792
Patricia bath invented things that improve cataract surgeries

2632
02:03:14,048 --> 02:03:17,888
Ernst invented the lasting machine which allowed for greater

2633
02:03:18,144 --> 02:03:21,216
An easier production of shoes which previous to that was a

2634
02:03:21,472 --> 02:03:25,568
Severely complicated process but had to be done by hand and it Bass

2635
02:03:25,824 --> 02:03:27,360
Basically allowed for

2636
02:03:28,384 --> 02:03:30,176
I'm in all sorts of development right where

2637
02:03:30,432 --> 02:03:35,296
Right I've been I have a bigger issue with this whole dumb train of thought which

2638
02:03:35,552 --> 02:03:36,064
Is just like

2639
02:03:36,832 --> 02:03:37,344
Why are you

2640
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:38,624
Arbitrary

2641
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:42,464
Bowl America are arbitrary arbitrary it's only

2642
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:45,024
Most stuff was invented in Asia

2643
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:51,424
From a thousand million years ago it doesn't matter that's fine wherever

2644
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:53,472
It's fine crazy that's fine

2645
02:03:53,728 --> 02:03:57,568
Everything's just not been more white people didn't invent s***

2646
02:03:58,080 --> 02:03:58,592
There's two things

2647
02:03:58,848 --> 02:03:59,616
Yeah one

2648
02:03:59,872 --> 02:04:00,384
Is

2649
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:04,992
I think you just see disregard and disrespect like I said of

2650
02:04:05,504 --> 02:04:06,016
These

2651
02:04:06,272 --> 02:04:07,296
Figures of

2652
02:04:07,552 --> 02:04:10,624
American invention history because they're black

2653
02:04:11,136 --> 02:04:14,464
Nick finds them to be not not interesting

2654
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:17,536
Or anyting Auntie feels that he can denigrate

2655
02:04:18,048 --> 02:04:19,328
Secondly

2656
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:22,656
It's not about all this inventing stuff

2657
02:04:23,168 --> 02:04:24,704
It's about the fact that makes things

2658
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:26,496
Expect Google is trying to

2659
02:04:26,752 --> 02:04:29,056
Exclude white inventors as a racist plot

2660
02:04:29,824 --> 02:04:31,360
If you're trying to add regate the best

2661
02:04:32,384 --> 02:04:32,896
Results

2662
02:04:34,176 --> 02:04:39,552
Why don't you have Ben Franklin on there why isn't Thomas Edison number one why isn't Tesla there why aren't

2663
02:04:39,808 --> 02:04:40,832
I can't think of a whole lot of

2664
02:04:41,088 --> 02:04:41,856
I'm not like

2665
02:04:42,112 --> 02:04:42,624
Science Guy

2666
02:04:43,392 --> 02:04:43,904
Even I know

2667
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:45,184
That's pretty ridiculous

2668
02:04:46,464 --> 02:04:46,976
Why

2669
02:04:47,744 --> 02:04:48,256
Who did that

2670
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:50,304
Boohoo working behind the scene

2671
02:04:50,816 --> 02:04:51,328
Program.

2672
02:04:52,096 --> 02:04:55,168
Listen doesn't just happen by itself right you know that's not

2673
02:04:55,424 --> 02:04:56,448
That is not an organic

2674
02:04:56,704 --> 02:04:57,216
Search results

2675
02:04:57,984 --> 02:04:58,752
Someone went in there

2676
02:04:59,776 --> 02:05:00,288
You changed it

2677
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:01,312
And why did they

2678
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:02,848
If I was that allowed

2679
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:03,872
But that happened

2680
02:05:04,128 --> 02:05:04,640
For what purpose

2681
02:05:04,896 --> 02:05:05,408
Is that going to make

2682
02:05:05,664 --> 02:05:06,176
Google more money

2683
02:05:06,688 --> 02:05:08,224
Has the free market capital

2684
02:05:08,736 --> 02:05:10,272
Tell us no no no

2685
02:05:10,784 --> 02:05:11,808
It's going to

2686
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:14,112
Hurt white people's feelings

2687
02:05:14,368 --> 02:05:20,512
Yeah just reminds me of what I can't remember who said it was the Reconstruction Era Quotev like if you can

2688
02:05:20,768 --> 02:05:21,280
Vince

2689
02:05:21,536 --> 02:05:26,656
The poorest white man that he's richer than the black then a black king then you've got him forever

2690
02:05:26,912 --> 02:05:28,448
Something along those lines and it's like

2691
02:05:28,704 --> 02:05:30,240
It is such that just like

2692
02:05:30,752 --> 02:05:36,128
Oh who the f*** is this I don't care all they saved a billion lives and I'm just a piece of s*** yelling about how I'm breaking

2693
02:05:36,384 --> 02:05:42,528
Sazon are weird weird how great I am this person

2694
02:05:42,784 --> 02:05:44,320
Why does Google tell me about

2695
02:05:44,576 --> 02:05:46,368
People who saved live

2696
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:48,672
Yeah I've got racism to do

2697
02:05:48,928 --> 02:05:49,440
There

2698
02:05:50,208 --> 02:05:52,768
Emails from Alex's talk

2699
02:05:53,024 --> 02:05:53,792
That

2700
02:05:55,072 --> 02:05:56,096
The New World Order

2701
02:05:56,608 --> 02:05:57,120
It exists

2702
02:05:57,376 --> 02:06:03,520
Very scary thing George h.w. Bush is the leader of it because he use the words New World Order it's gone

2703
02:06:03,776 --> 02:06:04,544
Andante to speech

2704
02:06:05,312 --> 02:06:06,336
Here's Nick

2705
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:08,128
And it's going to be a showdown

2706
02:06:11,456 --> 02:06:11,968
Emergent grade

2707
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:15,552
Yet to be seen

2708
02:06:19,904 --> 02:06:20,928
Watch broader more lawn

2709
02:06:21,952 --> 02:06:22,720
For the u.s.

2710
02:06:22,976 --> 02:06:23,744
China's

2711
02:06:24,768 --> 02:06:25,792
Going forward house

2712
02:06:26,048 --> 02:06:26,560
That power

2713
02:06:28,352 --> 02:06:28,864
World Order

2714
02:06:32,192 --> 02:06:38,336
How is there a World Order that's a developing in the twenty-first century with that be a new state of Ohio and order out

2715
02:06:38,592 --> 02:06:39,360
I mean it is

2716
02:06:39,616 --> 02:06:45,504
Different it's confirmed it is different is ahead of an from the previous order

2717
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:46,272
Yes

2718
02:06:46,528 --> 02:06:48,320
There was an order in the past

2719
02:06:48,576 --> 02:06:54,720
And that order is no longer the same order as current so one could argue yes it is new

2720
02:06:54,976 --> 02:06:55,488
Right

2721
02:06:56,256 --> 02:06:57,536
Such stupid s*** Yelp

2722
02:06:57,792 --> 02:06:58,816
Anyway

2723
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:01,888
There's a discussion here

2724
02:07:02,144 --> 02:07:04,448
Assertive crypto strategy

2725
02:07:04,704 --> 02:07:05,984
That Nick employees

2726
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:07,776
In order to push his ideas

2727
02:07:08,032 --> 02:07:09,056
And this is

2728
02:07:09,312 --> 02:07:10,592
Who's part of

2729
02:07:10,848 --> 02:07:11,616
The end of this episode

2730
02:07:11,872 --> 02:07:13,664
He takes questions from the audience

2731
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:19,040
And some of these questions end up reviewing fair amount and I think

2732
02:07:19,552 --> 02:07:22,880
You make a great observation earlier about how like these

2733
02:07:23,136 --> 02:07:24,160
He's just thick teen

2734
02:07:24,416 --> 02:07:27,232
Explaining what does these people do

2735
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,024
That's basically what happens

2736
02:07:29,792 --> 02:07:31,072
An advocate asked

2737
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:32,608
It's not more productive

2738
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:33,632
Lay low

2739
02:07:36,192 --> 02:07:37,216
I still while I haven't gone

2740
02:07:37,472 --> 02:07:37,984
Full red pill

2741
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:39,264
Just yet if you have a note

2742
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:41,312
Some words

2743
02:07:41,824 --> 02:07:42,336
Some analogy

2744
02:07:42,592 --> 02:07:43,616
What is the dark light therapy

2745
02:07:43,872 --> 02:07:45,152
I have but I'm not

2746
02:07:45,664 --> 02:07:46,944
Is what I'm trying to say I don't know

2747
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:49,760
That's just it I don't know if I'm a liar

2748
02:07:50,528 --> 02:07:51,040
Filtrate

2749
02:07:51,808 --> 02:07:53,344
Without going full red pill only be

2750
02:07:54,368 --> 02:07:55,136
We can't make the art

2751
02:07:55,648 --> 02:07:56,160
Without the truth

2752
02:07:56,672 --> 02:07:57,696
And in order to lay low

2753
02:07:58,208 --> 02:07:58,720
Can't tell the truth

2754
02:07:59,488 --> 02:08:00,000
She argue with

2755
02:08:00,256 --> 02:08:00,768
People about him

2756
02:08:01,024 --> 02:08:01,536
Immigration

2757
02:08:01,792 --> 02:08:02,560
Headed certain point

2758
02:08:02,816 --> 02:08:03,840
You can argue about

2759
02:08:04,352 --> 02:08:04,864
Culture

2760
02:08:05,376 --> 02:08:06,656
Right at a certain point it be

2761
02:08:07,936 --> 02:08:08,704
To say well we don't want

2762
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:09,472
Immigration

2763
02:08:09,984 --> 02:08:10,496
Because

2764
02:08:11,008 --> 02:08:12,032
Downward pressure

2765
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:13,312
Low-wage work

2766
02:08:17,152 --> 02:08:17,664
Get sprayed if

2767
02:08:18,432 --> 02:08:20,736
Certain flight to not make the whole case

2768
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:23,296
Case with everything we know the truth

2769
02:08:25,344 --> 02:08:25,856
Cell

2770
02:08:26,368 --> 02:08:27,136
I don't know I'm

2771
02:08:27,392 --> 02:08:28,160
I'm feeling it out I

2772
02:08:29,184 --> 02:08:29,696
It's a lot of it

2773
02:08:30,464 --> 02:08:30,976
Improvisation

2774
02:08:32,256 --> 02:08:33,024
The long-term

2775
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:33,792
Grandpa

2776
02:08:41,472 --> 02:08:42,240
And what I'm really trying

2777
02:08:42,496 --> 02:08:43,520
Do I think is ultimately

2778
02:08:44,544 --> 02:08:45,056
We're going to have to

2779
02:08:47,872 --> 02:08:48,896
That will happen

2780
02:08:49,152 --> 02:08:49,664
Just trying to wifey

2781
02:08:52,736 --> 02:08:53,248
As I go

2782
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:55,040
Yeah I mean

2783
02:08:55,552 --> 02:08:59,136
Clear I feel like that clip should be played

2784
02:08:59,392 --> 02:09:00,672
For the American public like

2785
02:09:00,928 --> 02:09:03,744
Constantly just nonstop followed by me saying

2786
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:10,144
A teenager figured it out you idiots f****** team he's 18 look at it

2787
02:09:10,912 --> 02:09:12,960
Come on you f****** moron

2788
02:09:13,216 --> 02:09:14,240
Obvious

2789
02:09:14,496 --> 02:09:16,032
Just play it again

2790
02:09:16,288 --> 02:09:17,824
Play it again I'm going to say it again

2791
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:22,432
Right you know like following a falling in with him

2792
02:09:22,688 --> 02:09:23,968
Memes

2793
02:09:24,224 --> 02:09:30,368
You are either being tricked by him or you get it to your gleefully going along with

I want my own channel where I just play this clip

2797
02:09:38,048 --> 02:09:38,816
Going to go see

2798
02:09:41,888 --> 02:09:47,264
So there's more strategic talk here in and I do think it is you just have more

2799
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:49,824
Contact for your Loop

2800
02:09:51,616 --> 02:09:52,128
Nick youth

2801
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:53,152
It is wise to

2802
02:09:53,664 --> 02:09:54,176
Applewhite Nash

2803
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:55,712
Rather than

2804
02:10:02,112 --> 02:10:03,392
No icing

2805
02:10:05,184 --> 02:10:05,696
Ill-advised

2806
02:10:06,464 --> 02:10:06,976
I say that

2807
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:08,512
Experience

2808
02:10:09,024 --> 02:10:09,792
I'll tell you little

2809
02:10:13,632 --> 02:10:14,400
The job training and

2810
02:10:14,912 --> 02:10:15,680
See I went to a job

2811
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:17,472
4A

2812
02:10:17,728 --> 02:10:18,240
Doterra

2813
02:10:21,056 --> 02:10:22,336
And I was in the job

2814
02:10:22,848 --> 02:10:23,360
For it

2815
02:10:23,616 --> 02:10:25,408
And I was disqualified on my first day

2816
02:10:26,176 --> 02:10:26,688
Disqualified

2817
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:27,712
First day was like a

2818
02:10:27,968 --> 02:10:28,480
2 weeks

2819
02:10:28,736 --> 02:10:29,248
Job training

2820
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:30,272
Viafield rappers

2821
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:31,552
Pretty benign

2822
02:10:33,344 --> 02:10:34,368
And this was a think tank

2823
02:10:34,624 --> 02:10:35,136
It's pretty much like

2824
02:10:35,648 --> 02:10:36,160
Umbrella group

2825
02:10:36,672 --> 02:10:37,440
The big tent group

2826
02:10:37,696 --> 02:10:38,208
Were they have a lot of

2827
02:10:39,232 --> 02:10:39,744
I know people

2828
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:40,512
When they're that agree with

2829
02:10:42,304 --> 02:10:42,816
I know people

2830
02:10:45,376 --> 02:10:46,400
It's a big tent group day of

2831
02:10:46,656 --> 02:10:47,168
People liver

2832
02:10:47,424 --> 02:10:47,936

Field representative

2837
02:10:56,128 --> 02:10:57,664
And I was disqualified on Dave

2838
02:10:58,176 --> 02:10:59,456
By this Dopey girl name

2839
02:10:59,712 --> 02:11:00,224
IV for

2840
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:00,992
From Lebanon

2841
02:11:01,504 --> 02:11:02,528
Because I said I wanted

2842
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:03,552
To protect my

2843
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:04,832
Because I was against

2844
02:11:05,088 --> 02:11:05,600
Immigration

2845
02:11:06,112 --> 02:11:06,880
Now immigration

2846
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:09,184
Is a conservative issue

2847
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:09,952
Against

2848
02:11:10,464 --> 02:11:11,232
Illegal in

2849
02:11:11,488 --> 02:11:12,000
To some extent

2850
02:11:12,256 --> 02:11:12,768
Legal immigration

2851
02:11:13,536 --> 02:11:14,304
Policy of ARP

2852
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:15,072
Saddle

2853
02:11:15,328 --> 02:11:16,864
The policy of our party

2854
02:11:18,144 --> 02:11:18,656
And yet I get to

2855
02:11:18,912 --> 02:11:19,680
Disqualified for me

2856
02:11:19,936 --> 02:11:20,960
You been getting an entry-level

2857
02:11:21,216 --> 02:11:21,728
Call job at this

2858
02:11:22,496 --> 02:11:23,008
Servant of big

2859
02:11:24,288 --> 02:11:24,800
Cuz I said I wasn't

2860
02:11:25,312 --> 02:11:25,824
Immigration

2861
02:11:27,872 --> 02:11:28,640
And you realized

2862
02:11:28,896 --> 02:11:29,408
Two things

2863
02:11:29,664 --> 02:11:30,176
Number one

2864
02:11:31,712 --> 02:11:32,480
It's very difficult

2865
02:11:33,248 --> 02:11:33,760
To hide

2866
02:11:34,016 --> 02:11:34,528
You have to pay

2867
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:35,552
Cleco come

2868
02:11:37,856 --> 02:11:38,368
And at that point

2869
02:11:41,440 --> 02:11:41,952
At the same time

2870
02:11:42,464 --> 02:11:43,744
You think you're getting big

2871
02:11:44,256 --> 02:11:44,768
You think you're in

2872
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:45,792
Trading you think

2873
02:11:46,048 --> 02:11:46,816
You're growing your base

2874
02:11:47,072 --> 02:11:47,584
You're going into

2875
02:11:48,352 --> 02:11:49,376
But the minute

2876
02:11:49,632 --> 02:11:50,400
That you

2877
02:11:50,656 --> 02:11:51,424
Go little bit for

2878
02:11:51,936 --> 02:11:53,216
To the right the minute that you go off

2879
02:11:53,472 --> 02:11:53,984
A script

2880
02:11:54,240 --> 02:11:54,752
The minute that you

2881
02:11:55,264 --> 02:11:57,056
Go away from what your character that

2882
02:11:57,312 --> 02:11:57,824
They built

2883
02:11:58,336 --> 02:11:58,848
How to beat

2884
02:11:59,104 --> 02:11:59,872
You lose

2885
02:12:00,128 --> 02:12:01,152
Lose your money

2886
02:12:01,408 --> 02:12:02,176
You lose your funding

2887
02:12:03,712 --> 02:12:04,992
You lose a lot of your audience

2888
02:12:06,784 --> 02:12:07,296
Like imagine

2889
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:09,600
Imagine of Bill O'Reilly

2890
02:12:10,368 --> 02:12:10,880
If he was still on

2891
02:12:11,136 --> 02:12:11,648
Television

2892
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:12,928
And he said

2893
02:12:13,696 --> 02:12:14,208
I don't know

2894
02:12:14,464 --> 02:12:14,976
Some kind of white

2895
02:12:16,768 --> 02:12:17,536
You would be fired

2896
02:12:18,048 --> 02:12:19,328
You would be fired in a lot of pain

2897
02:12:19,584 --> 02:12:20,608
People would stop watching

2898
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:23,168
And he would stop making

2899
02:12:23,424 --> 02:12:23,936
Kimani and they would

2900
02:12:24,448 --> 02:12:24,960
Never had a boy

2901
02:12:25,728 --> 02:12:26,752
Blacklisted he would be

2902
02:12:28,544 --> 02:12:29,824
They would smear his name run his name

2903
02:12:30,336 --> 02:12:30,848
Do the mod every

2904
02:12:31,872 --> 02:12:32,384
Any would-be

2905
02:12:33,152 --> 02:12:33,664
Like the new David

2906
02:12:34,688 --> 02:12:35,200
Right

2907
02:12:35,968 --> 02:12:37,760
If you're doing it from the beginning of

2908
02:12:39,296 --> 02:12:39,808
Short of

2909
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:41,088
You know On The Fringe

2910
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:43,648
Not totally

2911
02:12:45,184 --> 02:12:45,696
Expected a neighbor

2912
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:52,608
Beyond that I think

2913
02:12:52,864 --> 02:12:53,376
The time is right

2914
02:12:54,912 --> 02:12:55,680
The money is there

2915
02:12:58,752 --> 02:13:00,288
Or we can really give it a shot

2916
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:02,592
And I'm definitely not a white Nash

2917
02:13:03,872 --> 02:13:05,408
Because if you're a white

2918
02:13:10,528 --> 02:13:12,320
Do not ever call me

2919
02:13:12,832 --> 02:13:13,600
Don't let me in

2920
02:13:13,856 --> 02:13:14,368
With the actual

2921
02:13:14,624 --> 02:13:15,136
Will not cease

2922
02:13:15,648 --> 02:13:20,256
Good good save their good save at the end Okay so

2923
02:13:20,768 --> 02:13:26,912
Is reincarnation real because I think Henry Ford is alive again I'm concerned that Henry Ford is

2924
02:13:27,424 --> 02:13:27,936
Baby

2925
02:13:28,192 --> 02:13:29,728
Yeah yeah yeah

2926
02:13:29,984 --> 02:13:35,104
Or George Wallace

2927
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:38,432
I think those it like

2928
02:13:40,224 --> 02:13:41,504
Some of that

2929
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:43,808
Some of the ability to articulate

2930
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:45,088
Some of this stuff

2931
02:13:45,344 --> 02:13:46,624
And somehow it not

2932
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:49,440
We like completely destructive to his

2933
02:13:49,696 --> 02:13:51,232
Ability to exist

2934
02:13:51,488 --> 02:13:53,536
In that in any kind of a space

2935
02:13:54,048 --> 02:13:56,352
I think it does speak to

2936
02:13:56,608 --> 02:13:58,400
A certain amount of Savvy on his part

2937
02:13:58,656 --> 02:13:59,424
I do think that

2938
02:13:59,936 --> 02:14:02,496
That's one of the reasons why I think that he is not like

2939
02:14:02,752 --> 02:14:04,800
These other people that are not angry

2940
02:14:05,056 --> 02:14:06,848
You know some of these folks

2941
02:14:07,360 --> 02:14:09,664
Are kind of boring

2942
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:12,224
In the sense that they do appear to be

2943
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:13,248
Out to scam

2944
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:19,904
I don't think he has any kind of moral Center or any ideological Center

2945
02:14:20,160 --> 02:14:22,208
Advantageous and expedient for him to get the most

2946
02:14:22,464 --> 02:14:25,792
Views on on YouTube in front of me

2947
02:14:26,048 --> 02:14:27,072
I don't know

2948
02:14:27,328 --> 02:14:33,472
I know I think they're people like Steven Crowder who push ideological things obviously he has

2949
02:14:33,728 --> 02:14:34,240
He has

2950
02:14:34,496 --> 02:14:36,544
Toxic and bad political position

2951
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:42,176
Is that that have an ideological a back to them but I don't think he has an ideological Center

2952
02:14:42,432 --> 02:14:48,576
Yeah like I am one of the things that differentiates Alex from even from Owen Shroyer is that there

2953
02:14:48,832 --> 02:14:49,344
Does

2954
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:51,392
Sit there is a point of him

2955
02:14:51,648 --> 02:14:53,184
That has a core to it

2956
02:14:53,440 --> 02:14:55,488
Yeah no his berci beliefs

2957
02:14:56,256 --> 02:14:57,280
That he was

2958
02:14:57,536 --> 02:15:00,352
Obsessed with and and changed him

2959
02:15:00,608 --> 02:15:05,216
As a team like that is a part of his trajectory in his career

2960
02:15:05,728 --> 02:15:07,520
And with Nick is there

2961
02:15:07,776 --> 02:15:08,288
There is

2962
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:09,568
Like that

2963
02:15:10,336 --> 02:15:11,104
Yeah something

2964
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:11,872
Know what

2965
02:15:12,128 --> 02:15:15,200
What's annoying is that he understands

2966
02:15:15,712 --> 02:15:16,992
I mean enough

2967
02:15:17,248 --> 02:15:20,064
I understand how things work fairly well into far as like

2968
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:24,672
Like I so manipulative game of it not just that but I mean

2969
02:15:24,928 --> 02:15:28,256
Doing of it as a job like with our show

2970
02:15:28,768 --> 02:15:30,560
We are beholding to our listener

2971
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:37,216
You know what I'm saying like it's not like our advertisers can drop-off if we say something wrong

2972
02:15:37,728 --> 02:15:41,824
What will happen is if we are dicks to our listeners they'll be like

2973
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:44,128
Hey stop being dicks to us you know like that

2974
02:15:44,640 --> 02:15:45,664
Sure

2975
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:46,688
Sure

2976
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:48,992
In the same way that's what he's doing

2977
02:15:49,248 --> 02:15:51,296
Only he doesn't understand that second part

2978
02:15:51,552 --> 02:15:53,856
Of being beholding to his is

2979
02:15:54,112 --> 02:15:55,136
His listeners to his followers

2980
02:15:55,904 --> 02:15:57,440
Which I think is where he's starting to get

2981
02:15:58,720 --> 02:16:00,000
Because it from what I

2982
02:16:00,256 --> 02:16:03,584
From what I've heard he's starting to get pushback from the whole incel people

2983
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:05,632
Repeating I don't know

2984
02:16:05,888 --> 02:16:11,520
Someone who is occasionally thought about sex or not I don't even know which one it is

2985
02:16:11,776 --> 02:16:17,920
Too much into paying attention to that stuff about him like not having sex or being

2986
02:16:18,176 --> 02:16:24,320
I think a lot of people do have an interest in that number of things on Twitter and I think a lot of people

2987
02:16:24,832 --> 02:16:26,368
Fallout 4

2988
02:16:27,136 --> 02:16:33,280
Yeah maybe jokes and stuff he's he is a figure the up-to-date kind of carefully

2989
02:16:33,536 --> 02:16:34,048
Terms of like

2990
02:16:34,304 --> 02:16:38,144
You kind of just have to ignore some stuff and be like okay whatever man okay

2991
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:44,544
Cuz there is more important things that are being said that maybe aren't as

2992
02:16:45,056 --> 02:16:45,824
Flamboyant

2993
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:46,592
Centaurus

2994
02:16:46,848 --> 02:16:51,968
A picture of concern myself with Alex

2995
02:16:52,224 --> 02:16:54,528
There are other things

2996
02:16:55,040 --> 02:16:58,368
Like instance of objectivism

2997
02:16:58,624 --> 02:17:00,416
Just clear understanding

2998
02:17:00,672 --> 02:17:01,184
Of

2999
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:05,792
Like a way to launder nationalism into

3000
02:17:06,048 --> 02:17:07,840
Other places

3001
02:17:08,608 --> 02:17:12,960
This thing where he's like no I am not a white nationalist at the end

3002
02:17:13,472 --> 02:17:15,008
Is such a

3003
02:17:15,264 --> 02:17:15,776
Very

3004
02:17:16,032 --> 02:17:22,176
Obvious way of saying I am but I want to say I have to say that I'm not is very weak

3005
02:17:22,432 --> 02:17:24,224
You know the question

3006
02:17:24,480 --> 02:17:27,040
If you'll remember here listen to what the question was

3007
02:17:29,344 --> 02:17:29,856
Nick

3008
02:17:30,624 --> 02:17:31,136
Weis to go

3009
02:17:31,392 --> 02:17:31,904
Full whiteness

3010
02:17:33,184 --> 02:17:33,696
Rather than 22

3011
02:17:40,096 --> 02:17:41,120
No I

3012
02:17:42,912 --> 02:17:43,424
Ill-advised

3013
02:17:44,192 --> 02:17:44,704
And

3014
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:47,520
His story that he tells is about himself

3015
02:17:47,776 --> 02:17:52,384
Going to try to get this entry level position at a think tank right where he says

3016
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:54,944
That he told this woman from Lebanon

3017
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:59,296
That he doesn't like immigration cuz he's trying to protect his people which is

3018
02:17:59,552 --> 02:18:01,856
His example of I guess

3019
02:18:02,112 --> 02:18:04,160
That's him toning it down to get a job

3020
02:18:05,184 --> 02:18:10,560
I guess that's what I heard him that's my understanding of the story is that he was like

3021
02:18:10,816 --> 02:18:13,632
There's no point in even pretending to say

3022
02:18:13,888 --> 02:18:15,680
That you're not a white nationalist

3023
02:18:16,192 --> 02:18:17,728
Because even when I tried

3024
02:18:17,984 --> 02:18:20,032
I'm so white nationalist

3025
02:18:20,288 --> 02:18:21,568
When I thought I was

3026
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:22,592
Bucking

3027
02:18:22,848 --> 02:18:28,992
Watering it down it was still overflowing with white nationalism

3028
02:18:29,248 --> 02:18:34,624
Succeed within vasta and I bring about some kind of cloud or notoriety to yourself

3029
02:18:34,880 --> 02:18:39,488
You have the potential for that to be taken away from you when I come straight to far from

3030
02:18:39,744 --> 02:18:40,768
Acceptable path

3031
02:18:41,024 --> 02:18:43,328
Ryan so the way to do it is

3032
02:18:43,584 --> 02:18:44,608
Is doobie

3033
02:18:44,864 --> 02:18:46,656
Front about a lot of stuff vehicle

3034
02:18:46,912 --> 02:18:47,680
Sleep f******

3035
02:18:47,936 --> 02:18:49,728
Weirdo yeah take the lump

3036
02:18:49,984 --> 02:18:52,288
But come along with it the marginalization

3037
02:18:52,544 --> 02:18:53,568
Grow your s***

3038
02:18:53,824 --> 02:18:54,848
To the point where

3039
02:18:55,360 --> 02:18:56,384
You know you can

3040
02:18:56,896 --> 02:19:00,224
Avoid those pitfalls and that's basically the Pathak

3041
02:19:00,480 --> 02:19:04,832
He's managed to walk right and I do think there is one thing that he got wrong

3042
02:19:05,344 --> 02:19:08,416
And that is the DeVille O'Reilly said white nationalist pigs

3043
02:19:08,928 --> 02:19:13,792
I'm not sure he'll be kicked out specially not not not now for sure for sure

3044
02:19:14,304 --> 02:19:16,608
No but I think that's exactly what

3045
02:19:17,120 --> 02:19:21,984
Is is also concerning about only being beholding to your own audience in the same way that Alex

3046
02:19:22,496 --> 02:19:24,544
Was after you know

3047
02:19:24,800 --> 02:19:28,128
After he was kicked off of everything is that like

3048
02:19:28,384 --> 02:19:29,152
Also

3049
02:19:29,664 --> 02:19:30,688
There is no stopping it

3050
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:32,992
Only the audience can stop him

3051
02:19:33,504 --> 02:19:36,064
At this point because nobody else can affect his audience

3052
02:19:36,320 --> 02:19:37,088
You know

3053
02:19:37,856 --> 02:19:38,624
Yeah

3054
02:19:39,136 --> 02:19:45,024
Yeah I wonder Hammond the audience I wonder and with so many of these folks

3055
02:19:46,048 --> 02:19:48,096
The audience also includes like

3056
02:19:48,864 --> 02:19:55,008
I don't know billionaire donors yet

3057
02:19:55,264 --> 02:19:57,056
Also an element of this that

3058
02:19:57,312 --> 02:19:57,824
Is

3059
02:19:58,848 --> 02:20:01,920
A confounding factor of the beholding mystery

3060
02:20:02,176 --> 02:20:03,712
You know that's fair

3061
02:20:04,224 --> 02:20:05,248
So

3062
02:20:05,760 --> 02:20:06,528
Interesting Lee

3063
02:20:06,784 --> 02:20:09,856
On this episode coincidentally make it the question about Milo

3064
02:20:10,368 --> 02:20:10,880
That's weird

3065
02:20:12,160 --> 02:20:12,672
Other question

3066
02:20:12,928 --> 02:20:13,696
Benzoin what are you

3067
02:20:15,488 --> 02:20:16,000
I like

3068
02:20:17,792 --> 02:20:18,304
I don't know I'm

3069
02:20:19,584 --> 02:20:20,352
I'm sort of

3070
02:20:20,608 --> 02:20:22,400
What about Milo I like them for a long time

3071
02:20:24,448 --> 02:20:24,960
You see him

3072
02:20:25,216 --> 02:20:25,984
Like causing half

3073
02:20:27,008 --> 02:20:27,520
Pool

3074
02:20:28,288 --> 02:20:28,800
Call Missy

3075
02:20:32,896 --> 02:20:33,408
Bottom

3076
02:20:34,176 --> 02:20:35,200
Brags about

3077
02:20:36,224 --> 02:20:36,736
The things he does

3078
02:20:42,112 --> 02:20:42,624
You know

3079
02:20:42,880 --> 02:20:43,392
Milo

3080
02:20:43,648 --> 02:20:44,160
He made

3081
02:20:48,512 --> 02:20:49,024
Annie Maybe

3082
02:20:49,280 --> 02:20:49,792
Sharing a

3083
02:20:50,816 --> 02:20:51,328
Little bit alternate

3084
02:20:54,656 --> 02:20:55,168
Your hearing

3085
02:20:56,192 --> 02:20:56,704
People on the

3086
02:20:57,216 --> 02:20:58,240
Fringe far-right

3087
02:20:59,776 --> 02:21:00,288
But I think

3088
02:21:00,544 --> 02:21:01,056
I think it is

3089
02:21:01,312 --> 02:21:02,336
Not wise

3090
02:21:02,592 --> 02:21:03,104
You still hold up

3091
02:21:03,616 --> 02:21:04,384
Someone who lives

3092
02:21:08,480 --> 02:21:08,992
Is a lot of things

3093
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:11,552
Search history

3094
02:21:11,808 --> 02:21:12,320
He's gay black

3095
02:21:13,088 --> 02:21:13,600
Brag

3096
02:21:14,368 --> 02:21:14,880
About

3097
02:21:16,416 --> 02:21:18,464
Things I can't even talk about on the show because they're

3098
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:19,232
You're so vulgar

3099
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:20,512
Other phone

3100
02:21:22,304 --> 02:21:28,448
He brags about the gay things he doesn't mean that's on the loop that's on the look like you guys get it do you know

3101
02:21:30,496 --> 02:21:33,824
Episode maybe should just be your Loop

3102
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:36,384
Let's add this to the loop

3103
02:21:37,152 --> 02:21:37,664
Not yet

3104
02:21:42,784 --> 02:21:43,808
Someday when it be

3105
02:21:45,344 --> 02:21:48,672
Time Israel for god sakes when the people are ready

3106
02:21:48,928 --> 02:21:49,696
To receive the red pill

3107
02:21:50,976 --> 02:21:51,488
I will go for

3108
02:21:52,768 --> 02:21:53,280
You have to

3109
02:21:54,816 --> 02:21:55,584
You have to sort of go with the

3110
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:56,352
The Temple of Time

3111
02:21:58,400 --> 02:21:59,424
We can only set the

3112
02:22:03,776 --> 02:22:04,288
You know I think

3113
02:22:04,544 --> 02:22:05,056
Time is deaf

3114
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:07,872
Anna's right in the United

3115
02:22:11,712 --> 02:22:12,480
See the European

3116

Suing Italy

3117
02:22:17,856 --> 02:22:18,880
Definitely more viable

3119
02:22:20,928 --> 02:22:21,952
Where is an America where

3120
02:22:23,488 --> 02:22:24,000
Where are you at 3

3121

Vermilion PT

3122
02:22:29,376 --> 02:22:30,656
I don't think people are as susceptible

3123
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:33,472
That's sort of Far Far Right mess

3124
02:22:34,240 --> 02:22:34,752
You may have

3125
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:36,544
Extremely far right

Propaganda

3129
02:22:40,640 --> 02:22:41,408
But you have to have people

3130
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:43,200
Can short of be palatable

3131
02:22:43,712 --> 02:22:44,224
To the mainstream

3132
02:22:45,248 --> 02:22:46,016
To focus those eyes

3133
02:22:46,272 --> 02:22:46,784
Ideas to make

3134
02:22:49,600 --> 02:22:50,112

3145
02:23:18,528 --> 02:23:19,040
More people

3146
02:23:19,296 --> 02:23:22,880
Ironic that like

3147
02:23:23,136 --> 02:23:28,512
Yours is right in their thousands of friends

3148
02:23:28,768 --> 02:23:29,280
Just

3149
02:23:29,792 --> 02:23:30,816
Just f******

3150
02:23:31,072 --> 02:23:34,656
I'm I'm frustrated that we live in a simulation where this kind of

3151
02:23:35,680 --> 02:23:36,704
Okay.

3152
02:23:36,960 --> 02:23:41,824
You know I used to call you which but now clearly you're just be architect of my f****** torment

3153
02:23:42,080 --> 02:23:44,128
That must be what's going on right

3154
02:23:44,384 --> 02:23:50,528
Ugly in this frustrating for me to

3155
02:23:50,784 --> 02:23:55,392
It's much like Nick Fuentes you know you have to lie about everything

3156
02:23:55,648 --> 02:24:01,792
Until you don't have to lie anymore sure once the people are ready to embrace that white nationalism

3157
02:24:02,048 --> 02:24:03,584
I'm going to lie until I don't have

3158
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:09,984
There's also a strategic purpose to the lying and that is to be somebody who is a little bit more

3159
02:24:10,240 --> 02:24:11,008
Palatable

3160
02:24:11,264 --> 02:24:15,104
That is is getting those seeds out of their of this.

3161
02:24:15,360 --> 02:24:16,128
I mean

3162
02:24:16,384 --> 02:24:17,408
Quite honestly

3163
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:24,064
Whether consciously or not that is also like a fair description of what Tim pool does

3164
02:24:24,320 --> 02:24:29,952
Like I think that is obviously far more aware and self-actualize

3165
02:24:30,208 --> 02:24:31,232
About this

3166
02:24:31,744 --> 02:24:36,096
But you know it is a description of a lot of people within that

3167
02:24:36,352 --> 02:24:42,496
This sphere of media figures of just like listen this is how they launder bulshit do you not

3168
02:24:42,752 --> 02:24:43,776
It is 18

3169
02:24:45,568 --> 02:24:46,336
Years ago

3170
02:24:46,848 --> 02:24:48,640
Years ago but seeing

3171
02:24:49,152 --> 02:24:52,480
That might be what makes him so

3172
02:24:52,992 --> 02:24:53,504
Kind of

3173
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:54,528
Able

3174
02:24:54,784 --> 02:24:55,808
22 work

3175
02:24:56,320 --> 02:24:58,368
Yeah space

3176
02:24:58,624 --> 02:25:04,768
Like it isn't something that most eighteen-year-olds would understand on this side of a level

3177
02:25:05,024 --> 02:25:11,168
Propaganda the man was born to lie to people

3178
02:25:11,424 --> 02:25:12,192
Just his skills

3179
02:25:12,448 --> 02:25:17,312
Yeah I think that is also a part of

3180
02:25:17,568 --> 02:25:18,592
Of

3181
02:25:19,104 --> 02:25:20,128
You know what makes it

3182
02:25:21,152 --> 02:25:22,432
Kind of disconcerting

3183
02:25:22,688 --> 02:25:25,504
Vicky's here with ye and Milo in this

3184
02:25:26,016 --> 02:25:28,064
Bizarre Trio of

3185
02:25:28,576 --> 02:25:31,136
Your folks were pushing anti-Semitism it's like

3186
02:25:31,392 --> 02:25:37,536
He's only learned more sent this point when he was 18

3187
02:25:37,792 --> 02:25:40,608
Pressing some strategy that he decided I shouldn't

3188
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:42,656
I don't pursue this

3189
02:25:42,912 --> 02:25:43,680
This is

3190
02:25:43,936 --> 02:25:45,472
This is essentially like

3191
02:25:45,728 --> 02:25:51,872
You can see the footprints of this moving forward through his cuz I mean on that Tim pool interview he should have been Champa

3192
02:25:52,128 --> 02:25:56,480
Bring a cigar going I love it when a plan comes together like that is literally what's going on

3193
02:25:57,248 --> 02:25:59,296
One Life Club here

3194
02:26:00,320 --> 02:26:00,832
Colonel John

3195
02:26:03,904 --> 02:26:04,672
A story that is real

3196
02:26:04,928 --> 02:26:05,952
Rarely if ever been

3197
02:26:06,208 --> 02:26:06,720
Controlled

3198
02:26:06,976 --> 02:26:08,512
The really good story that is

3199
02:26:08,768 --> 02:26:09,280
A leaf

3200
02:26:11,328 --> 02:26:11,840
Great story

3201
02:26:13,376 --> 02:26:13,888
I don't know why

3202
02:26:20,288 --> 02:26:20,800
I don't know

3203
02:26:21,312 --> 02:26:22,080
I don't know I

3204
02:26:23,104 --> 02:26:23,616
Think I'm a wreck

3205
02:26:28,224 --> 02:26:28,736
Rebuttal

3206
02:26:29,760 --> 02:26:31,552
I am annoyed actually I have

3207
02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:34,112
If I ever

3208
02:26:34,368 --> 02:26:34,880
If I ever

3209
02:26:35,136 --> 02:26:35,904
Heard that story

3210
02:26:36,416 --> 02:26:36,928
It would be race

3211
02:26:43,584 --> 02:26:44,096
I'm going to get in trouble

3212
02:26:46,912 --> 02:26:47,680
Reven knowing

3213
02:26:47,936 --> 02:26:49,216
Isn't that crazy in this country

3214
02:26:49,472 --> 02:26:50,496
If you know about something and

3215
02:26:50,752 --> 02:26:51,264
You talk about some

3216
02:26:52,032 --> 02:26:52,800
You get in trouble is if

3217
02:26:53,056 --> 02:26:53,568
If you're like

3218
02:26:54,336 --> 02:26:55,360
Dedicated to it at

3219
02:26:55,616 --> 02:26:56,384
Your whole life like

3220
02:26:57,152 --> 02:26:57,664
Cuz you mentioned song

3221
02:26:58,944 --> 02:27:03,296
So the greatest story never told is a documentary that is

3222
02:27:04,064 --> 02:27:08,416
Is arguably the most anti-Semitic thing that's ever been produced

3223
02:27:09,952 --> 02:27:16,096
Maybe a little bit but positive depiction of Hitler

3224
02:27:19,680 --> 02:27:25,824
Like this playing around in his dancing around is is just a fun way to Wink in

3225
02:27:29,408 --> 02:27:31,200
Because that is also part of the game

3226
02:27:32,736 --> 02:27:34,016
It's the most annoying part

3227
02:27:34,272 --> 02:27:35,808
The most annoying part

3228
02:27:36,064 --> 02:27:36,832
That you just

3229
02:27:37,088 --> 02:27:40,416
Laugh while you say the things you believe so you can later call it a joke

3230
02:27:40,672 --> 02:27:42,720
Knitted annoying and it's frustrating

3231
02:27:42,976 --> 02:27:45,792
I like jokes we write jokes where it jokes

3232
02:27:46,048 --> 02:27:47,584
Good

3233
02:27:49,376 --> 02:27:50,144
Structured

3234
02:27:50,656 --> 02:27:51,168
Weather

3235
02:27:51,424 --> 02:27:52,192
Meaningful

3236
02:27:52,448 --> 02:27:53,216
Sometimes

3237
02:27:54,496 --> 02:27:56,032
Sometimes you just talk and you say fart

3238
02:27:56,288 --> 02:27:56,800
Yep

3239
02:27:57,056 --> 02:27:58,848
That's pretty much when he's do it

3240
02:27:59,360 --> 02:28:00,896
Start my man's art buddy

3241
02:28:01,152 --> 02:28:04,224
So yeah we come to the end of this and

3242
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:07,040
I guess I think that there are some

3243
02:28:07,296 --> 02:28:11,904
Things obviously there's a different flavor to like an episode of America

3244
02:28:12,160 --> 02:28:16,000
The first than they can Infowars episode

3245
02:28:16,256 --> 02:28:19,328
There is less of an interest in acting out

3246
02:28:20,352 --> 02:28:21,888
Generally speaking

3247
02:28:22,656 --> 02:28:25,472
But there's also a difference between this

3248
02:28:25,728 --> 02:28:26,496
And Owen

3249
02:28:26,752 --> 02:28:28,032
I do think

3250
02:28:28,544 --> 02:28:31,872
Well not as theatrical is Alex per say

3251
02:28:32,128 --> 02:28:35,712
There is a different kind of competence

3252
02:28:36,224 --> 02:28:37,760
As a host even at 18

3253
02:28:38,016 --> 02:28:40,064
You can you can tell

3254
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:40,832
From

3255
02:28:41,088 --> 02:28:41,600
From Nick

3256
02:28:41,856 --> 02:28:42,624
Yeah that makes sense

3257
02:28:43,648 --> 02:28:46,720
You know it's something that I do think that I I feel

3258
02:28:46,976 --> 02:28:48,256
Like we should cover more of

3259
02:28:48,768 --> 02:28:51,584
And I think we will I think we'll cover some more of this because

3260
02:28:52,096 --> 02:28:54,144
Until this plays its natural course

3261
02:28:54,400 --> 02:28:55,936
I do see

3262
02:28:56,192 --> 02:29:00,032
This Trio of weirdos and it's something

3263
02:29:01,056 --> 02:29:02,336
It does not deserve

3264
02:29:03,872 --> 02:29:04,384
Super

3265
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:06,176
Official

3266
02:29:06,432 --> 02:29:10,016
Sort of a mocking or superficial analysis

3267
02:29:10,272 --> 02:29:14,368
I think it is something that points to a big problem and

3268
02:29:14,624 --> 02:29:15,392
II

3269
02:29:15,648 --> 02:29:19,232
I think that we can we can look at it and deconstruct stuff

3270
02:29:19,744 --> 02:29:22,304
It's best we can with the tools at our disposal

3271
02:29:22,816 --> 02:29:23,328
But

3272
02:29:23,584 --> 02:29:25,120
We are still going to talk about

3273
02:29:26,656 --> 02:29:27,424
That. Don't be

3274
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:32,032
Concerned listener if Nick and Owen were in the same contest I

3275
02:29:32,288 --> 02:29:34,848
I think Alex would have been like well we obviously can't

3276
02:29:35,616 --> 02:29:37,152
The eighteen-year-old let's just hire all

3277
02:29:37,408 --> 02:29:40,224
What's the contest

3278
02:29:40,480 --> 02:29:41,248
That's right Apollo

3279
02:29:41,504 --> 02:29:44,576
And I think they probably wouldn't have done it

3280
02:29:44,832 --> 02:29:50,976
No that's what I'm saying and it would have been right Nick wouldn't have gone along because he wasn't

3281
02:29:51,232 --> 02:29:52,000
We couldn't have gotten

3282
02:29:56,864 --> 02:30:01,472
Oh I would the thing that I was thinking of the same year that Gary put Nick and Owen

3283
02:30:01,984 --> 02:30:04,800
In the same place I am like I just made me think of Seabeck

3284
02:30:07,104 --> 02:30:08,640
With kind of

3285
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:11,712
He was dunked on but

3286
02:30:11,968 --> 02:30:14,272
Owned

3287
02:30:16,064 --> 02:30:18,112
Get owned at Twitter

3288
02:30:18,368 --> 02:30:19,136
That's it

3289
02:30:19,392 --> 02:30:21,952
We'll be back with another episode

3290
02:30:23,744 --> 02:30:24,256
I don't

3291
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:31,424
Love the developments in the world but I would also be lying if I said that they didn't intersect with the stuff that we talked about

3292
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:34,240
Yep and it seems like it would be

3293
02:30:34,496 --> 02:30:35,520
May be negligent

3294
02:30:35,776 --> 02:30:39,360
To not to poke her nose in a little bit and see what's going on twice

3295
02:30:41,152 --> 02:30:41,664
Jordan

3296
02:30:42,176 --> 02:30:42,688
Bless you

3297
02:30:43,200 --> 02:30:43,968
Indeed we will

3298
02:30:44,224 --> 02:30:48,064
But it doesn't make me do it

3299
02:30:49,088 --> 02:30:50,880
We aren't winners that knowledge underscore fight

3300
02:30:51,392 --> 02:30:52,416
Jordan

3301
02:30:52,928 --> 02:30:53,952
Will be back but until then

3302
02:30:54,464 --> 02:30:56,768
Emilio Emilio I'm dzx Clark

3303
02:30:59,328 --> 02:31:00,096
Working on

3304
02:31:00,352 --> 02:31:00,864
The script

3305
02:31:01,120 --> 02:31:05,216
Even working on a script yet the one that you've been telling me about okay

3306
02:31:05,472 --> 02:31:05,984
It's basic

3307
02:31:06,240 --> 02:31:09,824
My idea is I want to write the Next Great American novel

3308
02:31:10,080 --> 02:31:10,592
But as a

3309
02:31:10,848 --> 02:31:11,616
Stats

3310
02:31:12,128 --> 02:31:14,176
Breathe right there going to be jokes

3311
02:31:14,432 --> 02:31:20,576
It's going to be a coming-of-age story a bildungsroman

3312
02:31:20,832 --> 02:31:26,976
Doctor Who like an attractive person. Maybe I figured that part out exactly

3313
02:31:27,232 --> 02:31:31,072
Hurting expectation to read this

3314
02:31:31,328 --> 02:31:33,120
That's not a script

3315
02:31:33,888 --> 02:31:34,400
That's a f******

3316
02:31:36,192 --> 02:31:38,240
And now here comes the sex robots

3317
02:31:38,496 --> 02:31:40,544
Holding

3318
02:31:42,592 --> 02:31:45,664
Alex, first in color with huge fan I love your work
