Formerly known as Kanye West Plaza on Thursday

12
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,344
And that's already talked about today

13
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,112
Because of the

14
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:30,880
This

15
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,928
I ended up thinking about like

16
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,048
What's my history with Yaz music like

17
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:41,632
Kanye West fan in terms of the music

18
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:48,032
Still here some of the songs on the radio like Jesus walks on bikes to find good stuff I think that toast to The a****** Song

19
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:54,432
Maybe a searching moment of like a pop song

20
00:01:54,688 --> 00:02:00,832
Does taking the piss out of himself in a way that I realize probably wasn't sincere right

21
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,136

00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:09,792

00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:30,591
Crazy how much I'm in on the long-lost Wednesday small clarification

60
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:36,223
Did they reconnect before the show or is the show their reconnection

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,503
Found each other

62
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,343
Like right before the show and then the show was there like

63

00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:08,991
TV show Prospectors

68
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,527

69
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,599

75
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,759
I do think there is something slightly

76
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:45,087
Not great about it as much as they're like jumping

77
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:51,487
From location to location is not enough time to like really appreciate all of the places they're traveling

78
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:54,047
Still you could see a lot of great stuff and a lot of

79
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:59,423

00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,111
Those albums really I think prove to me

104
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,903
That he's coming back

105
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:29,535
Like this is going to be the interview where he takes it all back he reveals that this is a performance done

106
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:35,935
Like he's going to do the whole thing for all addresses to Tim pool

Some introductory comments

135
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,687
2

136
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,735
Come up with anything

137
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:29,855
It was really difficult to come up with a synthesis or a real point

138
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,535
We say other than

139
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,815
Yeah you showed up

140
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:42,399

00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:47,519
Temple not agreeing that they means the Jews and here we are

142
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,591
And here we are you know Alex is

143
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,871
Not great

144
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:58,271
Write editor views true clearly in a subservient state

145
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:01,599
By gay on one side Nick Fuentes on the other

146
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,159
Great and it's just

147
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:08,511
I mean it's a Trainwreck this is just bad it's bad on 100 levels

148
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,279
And

149
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:13,119
One thing that I think I guess if I had to give an introduction it would be that

150
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,167
I've seen a lot of people talking

151
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,191
About this

152
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,471
Giving

153
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,239
Takes

154
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,519
And they're all wrong

155
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,055
They're also all right

156
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:26,431
Sure is where we existed existed

157
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,967
Lisa's bunch of terrible stuff

158
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,247
Absolutely correct

159
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,319
I also incorrect in as much as theirs

160
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,343
There's also

161
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,439
Things that some people are missing that are really bad as what theirs

162
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,719
Yeah

163
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,999
Then just bad stuff

164
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:45,887
No I when I open the internet and saw the Kanye was on I stopped and I closed it

165
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,679
Not least of which because

166
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,959
I I just

167
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:54,079
Can't ever believe that anyone in the media will listen to our how not to cover Alex Jones at

168
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:59,455
Episodes and so the amount of failure and embarrassment I'm expecting from them

169
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,479
Is stagger

170
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,111
Please into that is there's this like

171
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,135
Even Alex

172
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,415
Sue's like

173
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:13,535
Put off by 5

174
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,071
There is a little bit of that

175
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,143
But larger picture there's a context in which

176
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
He is

177
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:25,567
Put off and gives push back something that is being missed by a lot of commenting on this

178
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,895
Attention to as we as we go through this

179
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,175
The first

180
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,711
Before we get into anything haha

181
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,479
There's not a contacts

182
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
Boy

183
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,343
I'm not on the hole

184
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:38,879
Juicing

185
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,647
Oh

186
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,183
I'm not on

187
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,719
The whole

188
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:46,047
Do you think you can see how like he's

189
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:51,935
Struggling to

190
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,959
Butthead look man

191
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,775
I'm not into the hey hey hey hey

192
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,055
Maybe that's you

193
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,079
But that ain't me

194
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,895
So here we go we start off

195
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:05,759
I should say just for a little bit of a context

196
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,039
Yeah is wearing a

197
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,575
Full face mask

198
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:12,159
Like a balaclava but with no eye holes

199
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,695
It's just a black mask

200
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:18,303
Cloth Mask Jams in a Broadway show

201
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,887
Yeah I guess so

202
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:28,031
Wholesale never takes it off

203
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,567
I can't see him

204
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,615
It's a little bit off-putting just

205
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,151
Just right out of the gate

206
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,383
Do you think you're having

207
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,231
The way

208
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,119
And the way that we'd

209
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,935
What are business days

210
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,519
Course

211
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,535
He's wearing a full-face cloth mask

212
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,887
It's weird but honestly I don't really care if there's some kind of artistic meaning behind it

213
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:04,543
There really isn't any point in saying he's going mask off because that masks been off for a while now and I guess he could be

214
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,847
Aiming for something along the lines of like reject

215
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:10,943
Sing his own celebrity at making himself appear to be an anonymous blank slate

216
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:17,343
But even if that's the point it's dumb because if you weren't just any random person making the statements he has been no

217
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,879
Any attention

218
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,463
The only reason no one's kicked his ass yet is because he's gay

219
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:28,863
Ironically his Celebrity Status granted the privilege to say this b******* and people actually pay attention

220
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:35,775
It seems like his main goal here is to say that we need to send her things on Jesus and that's good well to a point

221
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:42,687
Disabled people should put Jesus first in their homes is kind of an opinion that doesn't work for everyone but it's not a problem

222
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,991
Being imposed on people

223
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:49,855
Suggesting that businesses at our country should operate in some religious fashion however is

224
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,647
Antithetical to the United States

225
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,207
And our Constitution that Alex claims to love

226
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,791
That isn't a problem for Nick and yay though

227
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:04,447
They want to be a part of a Christian fascism that's completely disconnected from the liberalism that value

228
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,983
Things like freedom of religion

229
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,031
Freedom of speech and free association

230
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,383
It's unclear how much Alex is aware of that but the people he's talking

231
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,407
Come to see things

232
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:19,807
He likes about God but their advocates for a system they would completely destroy all of the things about America that he

233
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,831
He pretends to love

234
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,647
Anyway this is possibly as innocuous

235
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:30,047
As gay could have started off the interview and already he's saying something pretty f***** up that Alex should push back on

236
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,071
But doesn't

237
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,607
I'll say this

238
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,423
1 not concerned about

239
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,263
Christian fascism so much because I was reminded that

240
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:45,663
If that were the case then Banks would be able to charge interest so I'm sure that they would kill whomever gotten their way

241
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,455
I'm not concerned there

242
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,223
I'm too

243
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,527
Put a riot

244
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:57,695
Put yeah Riot okay

245
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:02,815
I apologize that I didn't press that immediately

246
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:09,215
I'm going to light amount of sleep but I'm pretty proud of that

247
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:17,919
Look there's a lot of stuff that comes off as kind of non-sequitur Eve that's just the nature of having yay

248
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,479
Mike this is a little bit of

249
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,999
Michael Jordan

250
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,071
Any look at

251
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,959
And you barely can see a picture of them

252
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,847
What

253
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,111
That's stupid

254
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,671
Phil Knight is the co-founder of Nike

255
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,439
And there's

256
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:07,839
Tons of pictures of him smiling econfina pictures of him

257
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:14,239
Dunking from the free throw line but that might just be a skill problem

258
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,055
That that day was

259
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:20,127
50 years has back probably ways back

260
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:27,551
So I mean you know Jordan had a Hitler stash so you never know you never know where things are going to land

261
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:32,671
Honestly

262
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:39,071
Only because you said that he will hear it and go I will f****** dunk from the free-throw line

263
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,119
Dan Friesen said I couldn't do it

264
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,655
He's crazy

265
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:47,263
So there's just like I said it goes all over the place

266
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,287
Right out of the gate

267
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:52,895
Yeah besides to touch on the issue of everybody being very mad

268
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:56,479
About pedophilia related

269
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,375
10

270
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,847
Bible app

271
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,943
You shouldn't have phones

272
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,575
In order to serve

273
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,967
The moral compass

274
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,391
Vsf form

275
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,863
Does moral code

276
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,567
Powerful information

277
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,359
Quick question

278
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,127
Christ

279
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,687
Where do you stand on VR

280
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:34,015
Can I have virtual reality sex is that count

281
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,807
Gray said no

282
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,087
It's in

283
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,367
Deuteronomy

284
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,135
So this

285
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:44,511
Just a tailgate saying is not a new idea necessarily but it's one that's pretty important to push back on

286
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:50,911
The first thing that marriage pointing out he's that it means nothing to say that a person in important film is someone's daughter

287
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:57,567
That's just a way for you to count a rigidly paternalistic and misogynistic view the world into a form Rican percentage

288
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,847
Elizabeth Basin some kind of like

289
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,919
A sincere concern or care for another person

290
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,199
Instead of what it is

291
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,527
A lust for control other over other people's lives

292
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:12,671
The tell here is that he doesn't say that male actors in pornography are someone's son

293
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,999
That isn't part of this because at its core it's really just

294
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,047
The desire to exert control over women

295
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:23,679
In 2013 the Journal of sex research published a study titled pornography actresses

296
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:26,239
Is an assessment of the damaged goods hypothesis

297
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:33,407
This was a name given to a theory that higher rates of drug abuse childhood abuse and overall psychological problems

298
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,455
Led to women gravitating towards pornographic

299
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,223
Work

300
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:40,575
The study took the histories of 177 women in adult entertainment

301
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:45,439
And 177 women not in that field and ultimately concluded that the two groups

302
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:48,255
Did not have a difference in terms of childhood abuse

303
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,095
What you saying has no connection to reality in the big picture

304
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:56,959
There are certainly people in pornography where survivors of childhood abuse

305
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:00,287
That's the truth of people in journalism marketing or any other field

306
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,615
Now if ye cared at all about this issue the angle

307
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,175
Could be taking is to discuss the abuse that happen

308
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,711
Is within the adult industry

309
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:12,831
But that's a larger issue that I'm not entirely confident I can cover appropriately perhaps another day

310
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:16,672
And he doesn't seem to care about that all that much at all

311
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:19,232
The point here is the gay is coming out of the gate hot

312
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:22,816
With a complaint that feels different than his recent

313
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,840
Peace medical burst

314
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,120
But it's actually not

315
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:29,216
People like e Michael Jones who Nick Fuentes is a follower of

316
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:35,616
Have been very public they believe the pornography is a Jewish weapon against Christian Society so this is actually moron

317
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,408
Comfy but it might appear to be

318
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:41,504
And Alex isn't picking up on these threads or if he is he's not pulling on them at all

319
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,064
Yes just presenting this in a way that mask

320
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,344
Set underlying point

321
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,368
And so

322
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,136
That made it just

323
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,440
It comes off as if he's like oh you are

324
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,720
UCare

325
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:57,120
No I mean it's easier to look at a p*** industry and be like

326
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:01,472
All this thing because you can you can process the abuse against women

327
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:04,800
In a way that allows you to kind of internalized this

328
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,360
Well they may be there kind of where they should be

329
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,408
Point of view

330
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,456
As opposed to dealing with the fact that

331
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:15,296
All women in all jobs everywhere are subject to violence

332
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,600
Just by virtue of being women

333
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:21,440
And more than 40% of them will experience it at some point in their life

334
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,464
Regardless of what

335
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,232
You do

336
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,792
Maybe deal with the beat

337
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,816
Big problem

338
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:31,168
But no I think we should control their ability to do and say any

339
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:36,288
And I think I think that there is a an element of this that is deaf

340
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:40,896
Currently rooted in these anti-semitic narratives that people like e Michael Jones

341
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,176
Nick Fuentes perpetuate

342
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,992
But I think there's another thread that relates

343
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,528
Pornography that will

344
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,808
Subaru

345
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:51,904
Become more and more clear as this interview goes on

346
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,208
It makes me a little bit worried

347
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:59,072
But hey there's worse things in this interview so hey that's you know

348
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,120
You know

349
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:05,728
So was going to work clearly talking about Bibles.

350
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:09,824
You said you're upset he has his phone also has a Bible

351
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,920
Okay good well now I'm feeling better so anyway

352
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:16,224
Gay besides to read like a verse

353
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,040
Proverbs

354
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:19,808
Ava

355
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,600
Yeah but I think maybe it's when you can

356
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:26,208
Can still see through

357
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,864
Bad idea to wear full face mask when you're recording an audio thing a little bit muffled

358
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,632
Understand

359
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,504
For the wages of sin is death

360
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,200
Then shut the fuk up

361
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,856
The wrong way to read it

362
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:55,808
You get a little sense of little bit of insight about what's going on in this clip stressed

363
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:59,136
I'm never going to take religious advice for my new convert

364
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,160
To anything

365
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:06,560
If I need help understanding what a particular holy text says or what a religion is about I'm going to talk to somebody who's studied at

366
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:09,120
Someone who has a lot of time under their belt

367
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:15,520
The last person I think is a decent source is someone who's clearly in the grips of a public meltdown who's recently adopted a new

368
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:19,872
Legend has ended decided they figured it all out and I need to scream about it

369
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,920
Yeah Susie Astic

370
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:28,576
But maybe not all that helpful man you know there's nothing better than a real brand new Evangelical Christian

371
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,624
They're not annoying at all

372
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:37,280
Spaghetti is not reading a verse in Proverbs is clearly reading some article about this verse or maybe a blurb

373
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,560
Urban like a study Bible

374
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,096
The verse says quote

375
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,888
There are six things the Lord hates

376
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,680
Seven that are detestable to him

377
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:49,312
Haughty eyes a lying tongue hands that shed innocent blood a heart that devises Wicked

378
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,080
Scheme

379
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,128
Feet that are quick to rush into evil

380
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,176
A false witness who pours out lies

381
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:56,224
And a person who stirs up conflict in the

382
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:56,992
Community

383
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:02,880
The only thing I think of when I read that verse is how guilty Alex's of so many of those things

384
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:05,184
He's a complete liar he cracked Wiki

385
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,208
Steam console

386
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,744
Spell faults Whitney

387
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,608
Missing is on trial for his actions do little more than stir up conflict in the community

388
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,376
Constantly

389
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:19,520
If you were serious about this at all this. Should be him confronting Alex about all this but that's not

390
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,544
This is about

391
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:21,824
It's

392
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,616
Yeah I don't know

393
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,664
I mean here's my problem

394
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,944
Quite simply

395
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,784
Does any how is it how do you not stop and think

396
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,088
Am I

397
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,624
Am I supposed to believe

398
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,696
That The God Who created the universe

399
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,720
Also waste

400
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,792
His time coming up with individual punishment

401
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,328
For random sins

402
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:47,168
Do you got all the data God Is A Thousand Years

403
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,216
Well sure but I mean

404
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:53,824
Like is that cuz he's bored and if you have a board God I want a different God

405
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:58,688
I do not want to go

406
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:03,552
Infowars

407
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,832
Borgata

408
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:11,232
So yeah he goes on to turn into swans and f*** a lady you talked a little bit more about this

409
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,768
Send issue

410
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,816
Sure and I found this entry

411
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,936
Supreme

412
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,040
For whoever

413
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,904
Breaking all

414
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,240
Deep

415
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:07,040
I can't tell what that point that gay was reading from something so I decided to try and track down the exact phrasing that he was saying

416
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,344
Match one website word-for-word

417
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:13,696
He's reading from a blog post on a site called equipping Godly women

418
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:15,232
Website for

419
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:18,560
Busy Christian moms written by a woman named Brittany Ann

420
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:25,216
No shade on Britney but this isn't the source you'd pull from if you had a high-minded and serious interest in discussing whether or not God

421
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,752
Believes all sins are equal

422
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,776
From a theological

423
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,544
Perspective

424
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:34,432
There's honestly pathetic display and it's not because he's someone who's early in their Christianity but it's because it's

425
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:40,576
Is profoundly on serious about this end is going on a Juno National

426
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:43,904
Radio show TV show hosted by

427
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,464
A real piece of s***

428
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,000
And a expounding

429
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,280
Yeah

430
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,048
Yeah

431
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,840
Yeah what a weird thing to do

432
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:58,240
Yeah what is strange strange thing to do like stepping back from the bonus of it

433
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,032
Decision tree

434
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:03,616
You know like the number of decisions that leads you to this point

435
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,664
That's a lot of bad words

436
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:10,272
Like that's at least 40 or 50 bad decisions in a row like you could flip a coin

437
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:15,648
Somebody convinced him to flip a coin with all decisions and we'll get 50 there better

438
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:20,000
At least 25 right now the odds work

439
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,352
Call bad decisions

440
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,656
As will continue to be the case

441
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,936
So like I told you

442
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,728
Jay seems pretty matter

443
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,264
And

444
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,080
Is a little illuminate

445
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,712
Media

446
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,560
Graffiti

447
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:44,224
People reliving the trauma

448
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,672
What

449
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,976
Ferret

450
00:30:55,232 --> 00:31:01,376
What a couple quick points are not the p***

451
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:05,728
Even if we grant that he was addicted to the stuff that's still his issue

452
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:11,616
The dude just sounds like an angry loser W anyone else to be responsible for the situation he's in other than himself

453
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,408
The way is talking sound

454
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:16,480
Mentally abusive and I can totally understand Kim leaving

455
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:20,320
He's claiming that he has a problem with pornos and his way of

456
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:24,672
I'm thinking he can deal with it is to exert control over how his wife appears

457
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,440
Publicly

458
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:30,304
She won't let him control her and thus it's her fault that he can't

459
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,584
Stop with his p*** addiction

460
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,608
Somehow

461
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:37,472
He's so averse to correctly assigning responsibility that he has to insinuate that Kim was like

462
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,008
Duped into that picture

463
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,056
Baby was a Paste Magazine I believe

464
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:44,384
Internet article give a s*** about a Kardashian

465
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:48,736
That's absurd but in order for him to preserve the image of Kim is

466
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,016
A good person and not party

467
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,808
The evil system that he's up against

468
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,088
She has to have her age

469
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:57,440
Stripped away from her and yeah he has to not have been aware of that photo shoot

470
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:02,816
Just childish it all around and these are the kinds of issues that could really be helped with therapy

471
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:09,472
So much of this is ego-based nonsense and unfortunately to confront these kinds of issues you do need to approach them with a little bit

472
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,240
Humility

473
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:13,312
And that just seems impossible for yeah

474
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:19,712
I mean it must be tough to have humility when the world was like you're the greatest

475
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,992
Ever

476
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:28,928
I recognize that that'll make a person go a little bit insane sure when you get away with like

477
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,976
Calling yourself Jesus

478
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,768
People are like

479
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,096
Well

480
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:40,704
I feel I feel like a maybe culture enabled

481
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,752
It's a little bit

482
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:47,104
Yeah I can't I can barely take a compliment and that dude was getting your the greatest

483
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,640
Human being alive

484
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,176
No I get it

485
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,456
I get why it's crazy

486
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,248
So

487
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,016
People say

488
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,320
That gay is antisymmetric

489
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,344
People say

490
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,904
No good Nick Fuentes white supremacist

491
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:06,304
You know it's fun I think the only thing that they really have in common is saying the n-word more than a million times in private

492
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,864
Well and they're Christians

493
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,032
Interesting thought

494
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:05,184
Go to Jerusalem with weapons

495
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:29,248
So it's really important to get clear from the jump that using Zionist in any context

496
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,528
That it does

497
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,808
Just mean Jewish

498
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:38,720
This isn't someone who's making criticisms of the state of Israel for incidents in terms of the treatment of Palestinians

499
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,792
Someone using disingenuous language to make his antisemitism

500
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,840
A little less transparent

501
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:47,424
Also there's no contradiction between gays positions and Nick's

502
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,728
Nicholson 80-72

503
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:56,128
He doesn't like non-white people but a black man who is one of the biggest stars in the world who's shouting antisymmetric

504
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:59,712
S*** every opportunity that isn't a high priority for Nick's hate

505
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:02,272
He's generally more concerned about immigrants

506
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:06,624
It's a 3/8 of white people in the disenfranchisement of minority voters

507
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,392
At least

508
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:10,976
Primary race racism based concerns for him

509
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,512
Yes those are his primary issue

510
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,096
And yes Jesus did go hang out with marginalized folks

511
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,912
Cities time like sex workers and tax collectors

512
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:22,752
But he didn't go to the tax collector and then spend the rest of his career yelling about

513
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,800
Some idiotic s*** the tax collector told him

514
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,592
There's a little bit of a difference

515
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:33,248
In terms of the goal of hanging out with creeps

516
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:39,648
And say that you shouldn't be allowed to do anything that you want and you got tricked into doing

517
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:43,744
Listen I don't think you have any agency and you should work for me

518
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:46,304
Right

519
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:52,704
I guess Gay could go in like evangelize to R Kelly in prison but he just go in like

520
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,776
Brianna Kelly

521
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,872
Yeah yeah

522
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:04,224
He could try doing that for non famous people what if he did

523
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,016
Button and I'm going to throw this out there

524
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:06,784
Now

525
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,552
Maybe

526
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:10,880
Maybe he's very insincere about his

527
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:11,904
Bulshit

528
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,536
Partly because he is only concerned with other famous people and regular people do not exist to him

529
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:21,888
Let you know what that may or may not be the case but in terms of an interview like this

530
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,168
I'm going to give it a pass

531
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,960
Because you need frames of reference

532
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,240
Sure

533
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,520
You can only really name

534
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,824
Famous people

535
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,616
But you're probably right

536
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,408
So Alex

537
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,456
Is noticing some of this

538
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,504
Play Jewish talk

539
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,528
Coming up

540
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:41,088
A little bit early and maybe he's like

541
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:43,136
I got a I got to cut this off at

542
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:45,952
Oh my god did he not watch the temple never

543
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,720
Remind of course he did

544
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:49,280
It was 20 minutes

545
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,048
So

546
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:53,888
He tries to do a little bit of a his little Nazi deflection

547
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:54,656
That's fun

548
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,992
Call Zahra position Hitler

549
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,272
Almost

550
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:12,576
Crash-landed

551
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,368
All broke up

552
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,392
The other one

553
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,184
Air raid

554
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,464
North Africa

555
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,328
Captain

556
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,032
After that

557
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,456
Rounding up people

558
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,736
Tell me I'm a knock

559
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,144
15 minutes

560
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,472
Whatever point x

561
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:05,056
So this is really sad because I

562
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:10,432
Alex thinks that this is going to be effective in cutting off the anti-semitic stuff before it even comes up

563
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:17,088
He really thinks that saying that he almost doesn't exist because of the Nazis and throwing out this Bland ass Soros lies going to set

564
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:20,416
Table where ye can be presented as somebody who sang controversial things

565
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:23,744
What is being unfairly smeared by the ADL and Sora

566
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:28,096
He clearly hasn't been paying close enough attention to what's going on if he thinks

567
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:28,864
Bad because

568
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,424
Yay doesn't give a s*** about any of that.

569
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:36,800
Not going to stop him from saying that she's going to say anything signatories work for Hitler and maybe a

570
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:39,104
Compliment engages eyes at this point

571
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,128
Alex

572
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:43,456
Like Tim pool before him wants to have his cake and eat it too

573
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:50,112
He's so used to dealing with a completely different sort of figure because he mostly just swims in the waters of right-wing scam art

574
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:50,880
Artist tour trying

575
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:53,440
To use his wife want to grow their own scam

576
00:38:53,952 --> 00:39:00,096
You almost exclusively works with con artists to extreme right-wing politics they want to advance but are also really worried

577
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:00,864
But doing things

578
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,424
That will hurt their ability to run their stamps

579
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,216
He's used to people who will

580
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:09,056
Equivocate or will accept his framing of their own f*****-up comment

581
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:12,896
What Alex is doing here is giving gay a template for how to proceed

582
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:19,040
He's trying to Usher him into territory of anti-Semitic dialogue that won't get you in trouble because

583
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:22,368
Alex knows that ye spouting straight-up antisemitism

584
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,928
But that isn't something Alex going to profit off of

585
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:27,232
Without altering his position in the market

586
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:33,376
Becoming more like ye would involve scaring off older more Normie members of his audience in without them

587
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:37,984
The pill sales crater and he can't pay over at on the is expensive as Studio

588
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,520
But

589
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:42,848
If ye can moderate his position they can make some money together

590
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:43,616
Eren Yeager

591
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,152
Still be super anti-Semitic

592
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:48,224
Alex is trying to present him with a way to bacon

593
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,760
Implausible deniability

594
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,552
Seemingly unaware that yeah

595
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,088
Isn't that I any of

596
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,880
The s*** except the Holocaust

597
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:59,232
We'll get to that a little later of course he denies the Holocaust come on

598
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:01,792
Is every reason to think that this would work

599
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,072
Yeah is there with Nick

600
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:05,376
And Alex has had to do this with Nick in the past

601
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,424
I know for a fact

602
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:13,312
That Alex was fully aware of Nick's white nationalism and Neo-Nazi beliefs as early as CPAC 2020 and

603
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,336
He didn't care

604
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:20,992
He had me called repeatedly gave him his own channel on Bandit video and went on tour with him on these stop the steel Crusade

605
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:25,600
And all of that was possible because Nick played along with Alex's moderation language

606
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,392
But the thing is

607
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,440
That Nick was playing along strategic

608
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:35,584
He was following the exact plan that we heard him layout on our last episode where he wasn't showing his true ideology

609
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,352
Publicly

610
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:38,656
Because he needed to be a more acceptable face

611
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:42,752
To closer that the mainstream folks could X

612
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:46,080
He wanted when the time was right

613
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:52,480
Alex willingly or not probably willingly fell for that and this is the end result

614
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:53,504
Of that

615
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,784
These are the fruits

616
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,880
Lighting a hyper coppedge

617
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,416
Charismatic Nazi

618
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,976
Hijack applied for

619
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:08,608
Yeah yeah I mean let's say that I mean Lindbergh did it so that was good

620
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,144
You know we've had we've got

621
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,424
We've got precedent

622
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:15,520
Not the first time that somebody who loves Hitler's run for president

623
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,056
I mean what

624
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:20,128
You know what is this the New York Times in 1936 come on

625
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,152
How bad could it be

626
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,176
Right

627
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,504
So

628
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,296
Is Nick

629
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,320
Milo

630
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:33,440
And yeah we know that from the Tim pool interview but it turns out this is a deeper crew than we realize

631
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:36,512
Ali Alexander is

632
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,048
A bit involved in this

633
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,840
In ways that we're not queer

634
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,864
Previously

635
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,448
Was ye wearing a balaclava on January 6th

636
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:46,240
Does anybody know where ye was

637
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:52,640
I can't confirm or deny anything but I do know that a SWAT team of Truth

638
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:53,407
Great

639
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,711
Olly Alexander

640
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:56,735
Fuentes

641
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,271
SWAT team

642
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,575
Thoughts

643
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,855
Is Battle Ram

644
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,623
The door

645
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,647
And then they come in

646
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,439

647
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:06,463

648
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,743

Team

650
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,303
The media

651
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,679
That is a Zionist

652
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,007
Same approach

653
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:21,055
Well hey don't stay up

654
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:24,895
Mike Freeman

655

Specifically and I still not enough

657
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,759
They're still taking it too far

658
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:32,063
Everyone knows

659
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,647
Of American History X

660
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,415
Text machine

661
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,439
When they put

662
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,207
The guy's head

663
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,231
The curb

664
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:40,511
The back of it

665
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:41,535
And now

666
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,815
Kirby

667
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:43,839
Taking the foot

668
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:52,287
Call Dad

669
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,127
Ii-i'm sorry what

670
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,431
Things about Hitler

671
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,735
Charge I love everyone

672
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,295
You can

673
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,391
You know

674
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:08,671
And you can love

675
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,207
The contract

676
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,535
You know what word

677
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:14,815
But

678
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,631
Invented Highway

679
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:19,167
Invented the very micro

680
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,703
That I use as a musician

681
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:24,287
What ever did anything good

682
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,567
And I'm done with the

683
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:28,383
So yeah I guess Ali is part of the team

684
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:32,991
And that's a real solid team of losers that yeah he's putting together and

685
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,015
Who

686
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:34,783
Melly

687
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:41,183
So you see here ye are in some of the same grievances he aired another appearance isn't even making the same merican History X and

688
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,975
Algae that you made on Tim pool show

689
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:49,631
So stupid very rudimentary anti-semitic talking points but what bears a little more attention is how Alex's once again

690
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,911
Trying to give gay advice

691
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:56,287
Inform of form of reframing appointees making to make it plausibly acceptable

692
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,567
To a wider audience

693
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:58,847
Alex is trying

694
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,151
Give ye the out that he was just saying things in

695
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:04,479
Free speech and it's not like he's a Nazi or anything and then response

696
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,527
Jason Hitler good bunch of good stuff

697
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:09,343
Like how he invented things that he totally didn't invent

698
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,391
Alex is not ready for this

699
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,159
That's because

700
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:15,743
It's supposed to be a full show interview in less than half an hour in

701
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,279
Yeah he has lost his attempt

702
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:21,119
To make the disgusting antisymmetric should you say more acceptable to the audience

703
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:24,447
His double down and made his statements were

704
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:28,287
That would should know that this is now going this is going to be a long day

705
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:30,079
Yeah Alex is like wait

706
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:30,847
Hold on

707
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,407
Does ye not understand

708
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:36,479
That you're supposed to compromise your beliefs for money

709
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,527
I don't understand

710
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,063
Right what's going on here

711
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,343
This is Bonkers

712
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:46,207
Well you know there's this interesting Dynamic where Alex is like

713
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,999
If you got to compromise these things

714
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,535
And answered of

715
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,327
Negotiate this territory for money

716
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,863
And Nick is like

717
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,423
You got enough you got to compromise

718
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:58,239
And negotiate your positions in order to

719
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,287
Be able to be worse later

720
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:04,383
F*** that. These are good now I think I think

721
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,663
Quintus is loving

722
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:09,247
I would assume so

723
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,271
1 idiots

724
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:15,135
To ride the coattails of the blackface of white supremacy

725
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,183
+ 2

726
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,975
Who really cares about him

727
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:23,583
Everybody cares about Yeti so when ye stops he's got a higher-profile

728
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,887
Except here's the problem alright

729
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,423
There is no

730
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:29,471
Yeti to Hitler pipeline

731
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,287
Sorry I don't care how good Dark Fantasy is

732
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,055
No one

733
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,079
Who's likes

734
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:36,383
Kanye's music is going to be like well I mean

735
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:38,431
If this guy likes Hitler

736
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:40,735
Clearly that's the way to go

737
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:43,807
No Hitler know he hated Hitler pipeline

738
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:45,855
I don't know man

739
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:49,695
Too far I think that

740
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:52,255
Okay yeah I don't hear hear what I would say

741
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:55,071
I'm not positive that there is a direct

742
00:45:55,583 --> 00:46:01,727
One and then the other there is a roundabout way that this stuff

743
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,775
Stuff that but yeah is putting forth

744
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,823
Leads down the road towards

745
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:08,639
See I think that's the interesting thing

746
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:15,039
Yates not doing the roundabout way that would lead towards Hitler yeah is going straight to Hitler

747
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:21,439
Bring up and say come on baby this goes back to what he was saying about olly Alexander making him being the swap

748
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,535
He's making is that he's like the

749
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:31,423
The battering ram that comes in and then Nick is more like a sniper it does the more precise

750
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:37,823
To work and within that metaphor he can go straight to Hitler and it's still not have the negative

751
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,615
Give effect on that gradual path

752
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,919
Right that the audience is meant to be walked

753
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,991
Now currently I'm just going to throw this out there

754
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:48,063
I don't feel like Kanye is going to exit

755
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:50,111
The plan the way they wanted to go

756
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,647
No he's a good EX

757
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,671
Executor of plans right

758
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,719
I would agree with you

759
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:55,743
The

760
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,815
Essence of that

761
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,351
Makes

762
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:03,167
What you're saying not really all that comforting trip

763
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:05,727
Is that the battering ram does not have to be precise

764
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:10,335
You don't need that person to necessarily be the wreck

765
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,871
Ball is not mint

766
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:12,895
2

767
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:18,271
You know that's really follow the exact plan give me a couple inches off here and there

768
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,295
It all works

769
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,343
It Whatever destruction

770
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:27,231
And it is going on for someone like me

771
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:29,279
Well let me throw this out at you

772
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:31,071
A few inches one way or the other

773
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,607
No problem you're still hitting

774
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,887
The same castle right

775
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:39,519
But if you go say 1000 ft the wrong direction and join the Nazis

776
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,079
I think that's different

777
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,359
About time will tell

778
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,407
JLo's Hitler

779
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,199
God that

780
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:48,991
Infinite Highway

781
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,527
Invented

782
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,063
Your phone that I use as a musician

783
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:55,647
Anything good

784
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:56,927
And I'm done with

785
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:58,975
The

786
00:47:59,231 --> 00:47:59,743
Patient

787
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,279
Every human being has

788
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:02,559
Volume

789
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:03,327
That they brought to the

790
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,375
Especially Hitler

791
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:09,471
Emmanuel

792
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:11,263
You going to do anything to fix Chicago

793
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:15,615
Chicago

794
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:20,479
Emmanuel is Rob's brother

795
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:25,343
Throughout this interview ye will repeatedly say that he wants to take our ease wife into a private room

796
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:28,671
And help her with her fashion line is very Christian way

797
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:31,999
A bit like a sexual threat if I'm being honest

798
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:37,631
Hurry has never been in charge of Chicago and Ron hasn't been very here since 2019

799
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,167
He's the ambassador to Japan

800
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,727
So I guess I'll be a better reference

801
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,263
It's to make but who cares

802
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:45,567
Also there were 1700

803
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:51,967
45 gun deaths in all of Illinois last year but I'm not sure where these thousands of black folks dying about

804
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:52,735
Number Alex

805
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:57,343
Coming up with a all week

806
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:59,647
Small point there also

807
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,695
Over 3,000 gun deaths

808
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:07,327
Florida last year the number in Illinois but seriously Alex never seems to yell at the scientist about that

809
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,095
Seemed strange

810
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:12,191
It is weird also / 4,100 in Texas

811
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:18,591
Getting very straight Chicago supposed to be the most dangerous place on Earth

812
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,871
Scared

813
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:23,967
So we remember from the temple interview that

814
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:26,783
They really thought it was weird that Rahm Emanuel

815
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,831
And Jared Kushner both exist

816
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,879
And our Jewish that is strange

817
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,159
If you're crazy

818
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:34,719
He brings his back up because it's such a great point

819
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,327
Thing that I got

820
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,607
Stay with

821
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,935
Rahm Emanuel

822
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,239
Next Obama

823
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,519
There was right there

824
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:48,543
Text to Trump

825
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,311
What are those

826
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,847
Two people Zionist

827
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,127
I gave it away

828
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:52,895
Having Tom

829
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,967
Neoliberalism

830
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:58,783
Yeah you know when it's interesting because

831
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:01,343
You've been going out to interview Alex Friedman and

832
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,623
What's in pool a morgue

833
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:04,159
And I always say wow

834
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:05,439
Don't talk about it

835
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,023
Hypocritical because

836
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:11,071
In the same interview Tim Poole said

837
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,351
Be so great

838
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,119
For the black vote

839
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:15,935
We talked about you

840
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:16,959
Businessman

841
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,727
And somehow

842
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:18,495
That's a problem

843
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:23,871
So here's that SWAT team dynamic in full display

844
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:30,271
Something inflammatory for attention that Nick comes in and talks more calmly about it in a speech pattern of a debate

845
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,551
Great team member given

846
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,319
Giving me a

847
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:34,367
Credibility to what ye just said

848
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:38,207
We talked about it last episode but this Jared and Robin thing is f******

849
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:38,975
Stupid

850
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:45,375
Just because it blew yeas mind the two Jewish people worked in two separate administrations that doesn't mean it's actually buying

851
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,911
I'm blowing you might just be an idiot

852
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:49,215
As for what Nick is saying

853
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:53,311
He's complaining two different things intentionally but optically it work

854
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:55,359
And part of that is being done at 10 pools

855
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,127
Expense

856
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,431
Tim is stupid and I hate him but

857
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:03,295
I still don't want to be used as a punching bag by Nazis in order to make their dumb point to look less dumb

858
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:08,671
Saying that there's such a thing as the black vote is not analogous to saying the Jews run banking

859
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:10,207
That is a false

860
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:16,095
He'll be a valid point if you were allowed to talk about the black vote but not allowed to talk about the Jewish vote

861
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,887
That would be where the difference

862
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:22,239
Would be something that you could point out but that isn't what Niger yay points out because

863
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,775
People talk about the Jewish vote

864
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:24,799
Really

865
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:31,199
This is not very subtle sleight-of-hand that Nick is engaging in and he's doing that trick because his point doesn't work

866
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:31,967
Work without it

867
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:37,343
He's a dishonest Point designed only to excuse and justify anti-semitic talking points

868
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,391
And someone like Nick is more than willing to

869
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,159
Display this

870
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:43,231
High school debate level tactic in order to sell his life

871
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:44,767
And Alex's f***

872
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:47,327
Because he can't even out arguing High School.

873
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,119
I mean

874
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,423
Personally

875
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:53,727
My issue here is

876
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,543
Princesses point

877
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,567
Is dumb

878
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,615
And also is essentially

879
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:02,175
See Kanye can't be racist

880
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,967
Temple is also erase

881
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:08,319
Or or it would be like

882
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:14,975
And in order to say that ye is racist you would have to say that thinking

883
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:16,767
A black the black vote

884
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:17,791
Is something

885
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,327
Is also race

886
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,119
I guess but

887
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,143
I don't know

888
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:23,167
It's just awful

889
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:25,215
Anyway dick is

890
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:26,751
The worst

891
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:28,799
In the talmud it says

892
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:29,567
The Jews have

893
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:30,591
How to trade Gentile

894
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,359
Differently than they

895
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,919
There's all kinds of examples of

896
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,455
They say that if you ask

897
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,223
Accidentally

898
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,015
Maybe religion is awful

899
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,831
There's nothing even wrong with that

900
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:42,111
Morally wrong

901
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:44,159
Play say that for a Judah house

902
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:45,439
Gentile

903
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:46,207
Is comprable to be

904
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:46,975
Bestiality

905
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,255
They say that the semen

906
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,023
A gentile

907
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:51,327
Watching

908
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,375
Troy Gentile

909
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:55,423
A Jew is not permitted under the

910
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,191
How much to give

911
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:56,959
Is a gift

912
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:57,727
2 Gentile

913
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:58,751
They're not permitted

914
00:52:59,007 --> 00:52:59,519
They charge each other

915
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,311
But they're encouraged

916
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,335
Discharge Gentile

917
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:05,663
They say that that's

918
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,199
Paces listen

919
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:08,479
Well

920
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:10,783
So you telling me in their holy book

921
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,063
It said it's okay

922
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:13,599
Pedophile

923
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,695
That's only came from Adam

924
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,463
I'm not on

925
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:21,791
The shop front

926
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:22,559
I believe in

927
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,839
Free speech

928
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:29,983
Okay so Nick is being entirely disingenuous as a relates to the talmood and it's a relationship of Judaism

929
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:32,799
Plus this is a complete non-sequitur since

930
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:37,407
Talking about the religion of Judaism they're talking about Jewish people

931
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,431
What's going on

932
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:45,599
The talmud is a gigantic document which is a running discussion among rabbis between the 3rd and 8th centuries

933
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:51,999
You can find a whole lot of commentary on the Torah and laws in there a lot of it very affected by the X

934
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:54,047
When particular texts were written

935
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:57,631
Yeah it's important to understand that a lot of what's in the text

936
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:02,495
Is a document of a time and that even within the talmood there's an evolution of thought

937
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:09,151
Since the point of it's writing into the point of all these things rating Jewish thought has gone through further developments in the same way and

938
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:09,919
Any religion does

939
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:12,223
For instance there's a whole lot of s***

940
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:18,623
In the Bible that would get you the death penalty very few Christians would even consider the

941
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:19,647
That kind of thing

942
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,415
Problem

943
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:23,487
Deserving of stoning today

944
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:24,767
All the stuff

945
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:28,863
It's also Nick using historically anti-semitic misinterpretations of the tax

946
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,143
Austin order to make accusations

947
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:35,519
For instance the pedophilia accusation often traces back to this passage in the talmud

948
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:42,431
Quote if an adult has sex with a girl under the age of 3 it is ignored for it is like putting a finger in

949
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:43,199
Someone's eye

950
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:47,807
I eat ears made drip from the eye but there will always be more tears to replace them

951
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:51,391
So to the hymen of a girl so young my break but will heal

952
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:53,951
This is a horrific sounding Passage

953
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:54,975
Because

954
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:56,255
Neo taken out of context

955
00:54:56,511 --> 00:55:01,887
It appears that when it says it is ignored that means it's okay for an adult to have sex with a child

956
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:04,191
But that's a fraudulent reading a passage

957
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:11,103
It's part of the section involving the particular details about a reverse Dowry the amount of man is required to pay woman

958
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:11,871
In divorce

959
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:15,967
At the time for Jenna teammate a person's reverse Dowry be higher

960
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:19,551
So I understood his attacks really written the passage isn't about it

961
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:20,831
Excuse and pedophilia

962
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:23,391
It's making a hyper specific point about dowry

963
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,951
This is been used to accuse Jews

964
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:30,303
Of being pro child molestation by virulent anti-semites for a long time

965
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,863
And Nick is continuing that tradition on Alex's show

966
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,935
Any isn't he hasn't even met with a tiny bit of pushback

967
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:40,287
Alex isn't equipped to have this conversation at all and he's that with the position of allowing

968
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,823
These two to hijack his show

969
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,615
Or be forced to kick them off

970
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,151
He's not going to do that

971
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,687
So

972
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:48,479
Long day for Alex

973
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:49,247
This is what I'm saying

974
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,527
Oh man

975
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:52,831
Long day

976
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:54,623
When people bring up holy book

977
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:57,695
Great it is so great

978
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:59,231
1

979
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:01,535
Because it reminds me

980
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:03,583
That all of your gods are stew

981
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:06,399
And actually they're just dudes who are trying to

982
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,703
That's pretty much it

983
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:09,983
So

984
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:12,287
Argue all you want

985
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,823
There is a lot

986
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,359
Of that strain

987
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:17,407
And religion through history

988
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:20,735
So do you want you may not give a s*** about that but let me ask you this

989
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:23,039
What do you give a s*** about prop comedy

990
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:30,719
Depends you know what I like the amazing Johnathan you could consider him a prop, too

991
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:32,767
Anyways and I think he's probably one of the Great

992
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,095
Hairspray

993
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:42,495
Answer for the ATL

994
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:45,823
I'm going to have to listen up

995
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,103
What we did

996
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,639
As we brought Netanyahu

997
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,407
Weather

998
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:58,111
Netanyahu

999
00:56:59,135 --> 00:56:59,903
What do you have to say

1000
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:03,743
Beignet

1001
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:16,031
I have no idea

1002
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:17,311
Nice work

1003
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:23,455
Eye doctor

1004
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,223
I heard about this

1005
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:28,063
I thought you had a funny name

1006
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,367
Started funny name

1007
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:32,159
I didn't expect your voice

1008
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,439
You sound like that me

1009
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:39,839
So you asked me to pop it it is not he has a net like from a fishing

1010
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:40,607
Fish tank

1011
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:48,799
Emma is a bottle of Yoo-hoo alright

1012
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:51,615
Good

1013
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,895
I've seen

1014
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:54,687
I've seen carrot-top come up with worse

1015
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:55,967
Plumbing

1016
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:56,735
Maybe

1017
00:57:56,991 --> 00:58:01,599
Carrot Tops works I'm not sure

1018
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:03,391
This is clunky

1019
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,159
Not good

1020
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:06,975
Because of you who there's an issue

1021
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:07,999
Right

1022
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:09,279
It's also because you need

1023
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:10,559
Toothache

1024
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:12,351
Connected

1025
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:13,375
Also

1026
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,215
Talk about you

1027
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:22,079
Oftentimes they excuse a lot of s*** because he's such a creative genius

1028
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:28,991
Represent to you Netanyahu I mean let's say let's say

1029
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,015
Kanye

1030
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:30,783
Never

1031
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:31,551
Been fun

1032
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:33,087
In his entire career

1033
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:36,671
Yes remind me let's just run my people

1034
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:43,071
He's really bad at rapping I don't know if anybody's noticed that before he's not a great Lyricist I've heard he's the greatest rapper

1035
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:44,351
Cruise ever lived

1036
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:48,191
He's one of the greatest producers that ever live but

1037
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:54,591
I wouldn't go so far as to say he was a great rapper I know one guy who disagrees to use names yay

1038
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,663
I think he misses the old Kanye as well

1039
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:03,039
So Alex tries to you know make a little bit of a

1040
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:05,087
He keeps trying to equivocate

1041
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:06,623
Non-Stop about like

1042
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,415
Hey you do like

1043
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:10,207
You don't really mean this

1044
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,767
Come on. Doesn't work

1045
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,815
You guys realize that

1046
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,351
The British government

1047
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:17,375
Created Hitler

1048
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,911
The Miller group

1049
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:19,935
Power

1050
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,215
There's something much more

1051
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:27,871
Think about shoes are great people and I understand there's a Jewish Mafia

1052
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:34,015
And there is a much larger eugenics

1053
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:37,087
Scientific

1054
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,623
Abortion

1055
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,159
Percent of black

1056
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:41,695
Is over

1057
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:48,095
Did the lead lead

1058
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:55,775
Because of your wife

1059
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:56,543
McGill

1060
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:58,079
Shmoney

1061
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:00,895
So we can kill black babies I swear to God it's in my stack

1062
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:05,247
Do this this isn't a sack but it never is

1063
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:08,063
Never a can't find it it has never produced

1064
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,367
Because

1065
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:14,463
Yeah is the producer and director today

1066
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:19,839
Sure to get all the stacks of paper off a desk cuz it look too cluttered oh my God

1067
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,375
Oh my God

1068
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:23,679
I would've had it right here but

1069
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:26,751
What a delight.

1070
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:30,079
Hi I am I am finding this

1071
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:32,383
To be one of the great train wreck

1072
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:38,783
Oh I forgot it gets so much worse

1073
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:42,623
I think I think the problem that I'm having here is

1074
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:45,951
It is going to much worse

1075
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:52,863
To the point now where it's crossed into something ridiculous pulled out a fishnet exactly and done a little

1076
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:59,263
Elmo voice I mean

1077
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,031
In charge

1078
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:05,151
Alex is completely subservient

1079
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:09,503
Well Alex is a strfkr and yeah is probably the biggest stories ever met

1080
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:11,551
I mean

1081
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:16,159
I don't think Rogan gets this kind of treatment because Rogan's not yay

1082
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:21,279
Fair enough Canby Rogan Ali f****** once but he's not gay

1083
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,559
VM

1084
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:23,583
Sorry

1085
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:26,655
But still appearances on

1086
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:32,287
Fear Factor are not going to compare to The College Dropout is not going to happen ask you this

1087
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:33,311
What's that radio

1088
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:34,591
Newsradio

1089
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:35,359
Freddie Gray

1090
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:38,943
Pretty great it's better than gold diggers at least okay

1091
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:41,503
So

1092
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:42,783
Alex

1093
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:45,855
Really wants to try to push back

1094
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:47,391
Somehow

1095
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:50,719
While also being

1096
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:56,351
Israel has other than

1097
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:01,983
In the world

1098
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:07,615
Forcibly injecting Josef Mengele

1099
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:09,919
Israel

1100
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:11,455
So if the Jews are the

1101
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:16,319
Hollywood

1102
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:25,535
Work for God

1103
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:30,143
Fears that get Jews persecuted

1104
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,191
Right

1105
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:33,983
Makes perfect time

1106
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,519
Just like George Soros

1107
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:37,055
Hitler

1108
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,895
You just got there

1109
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:44,223
People are not dying in Mass because of covid

1110
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:50,623
Seems it's just a false promise Alex's to point but it's important to recognize a few things that Alex himself says In that clip

1111
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:52,671
These are not things that you're saying

1112
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:53,439
They are at

1113
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:59,327
First Alex says the Jews run Hollywood obviously

1114
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:00,607
Not yay

1115
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:03,935
Arguing that Jews control Alex Jones obviously

1116
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:07,519
Second track the thought he runs out there at the end of the clip

1117
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:08,543
He brings up the

1118
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:11,871
Fake information about Jews dying from the vaccine in Israel

1119
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:15,199
To be a Counterpoint to yeas assertion that Jews run everything

1120
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:20,063
How could they run everything if their own people are dying in Mass from the vaccine in Israel

1121
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:21,343
It makes no sense

1122
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:23,647
Jay responds it's the Zionist

1123
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:24,671
They work for Satan

1124
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:26,207
And Alex's exact

1125
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:30,303
This makes absolutely no sense if you're trying to follow coherent thoughts

1126
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:36,959
Zionism is based around the argument that the Jewish people needed their own Homeland originally in terms of the establishment of

1127
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:38,239
Israel and eventually towards

1128
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:40,543
A movement to develop and build up a

1129
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:41,311
Israel

1130
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,591
Apparently according

1131
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:47,455
Gay designers to work receiving and they're killing Jewish people in Israel which runs counter to

1132
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:53,087
You know the essential idea and facilitating point of Zionism

1133
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:56,415
Alex says exactly because he thinks he can work with that

1134
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:59,231
Narrative

1135
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:04,351
About how the Jewish people have to create their own oppression so they can assert their political agenda

1136
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:05,887
Think about

1137
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:11,519
How he said that the ADL calls everyone who loves Freedom Nazi so they can marginalize their political enemy

1138
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:16,639
Alex thinks that this is somehow elevated from gays anti-semitic rhetoric

1139
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:22,015
But in reality he's as deep in the mud as everyone else on the show he's just insisting his clothes

1140
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:22,783
Circline

1141
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,831
Really disgraceful and

1142
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:28,159
Yeah bad I mean yeah

1143
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:30,719
I find I find

1144
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:32,255
That

1145
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:34,047
People are allowed

1146
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:34,815
To LARP

1147
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:38,655
As though and I'm supposed to respect their belief system

1148
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:41,215
It insane. I find it insane

1149
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:43,263
They are arguing about

1150
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:45,567
Which of the Elven Lords

1151
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:47,359
Actually serve Sauron

1152
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:53,759
And that's beat that's it that's what they're doing their LARPing their balls off and I'm supposed to pretend to Christianity's real I'm out

1153
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,807
Counterpoint to that

1154
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:58,879
You get deeply involved in an argument about which of the Elven Lords

1155
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:02,463
I don't even remember anymore but you know what

1156
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,999
There were three Elven Lords

1157
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:07,583
Remember

1158
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:12,959
Sue Alex tries to deflect

1159
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:18,847
Obviously a lot of times whenever anything comes up like accusations of anti-Semitism or

1160
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:24,991
Nazi has tendencies

1161
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:26,527
Hedley tries that but listen

1162
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:28,575
Carefully here to this clip

1163
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,343
Yay doesn't care

1164
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:32,415
In America

1165
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:40,095
Charles compilation of him on MPR

1166
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:46,495
I like that

1167
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:49,823
Never killed any juice

1168
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:51,871
How do I get to

1169
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:10,047
So you might hurt their I like Hitler

1170
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:16,447
Thing to understand here and that is what Alex is constantly trying to not push back on the things that you

1171
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:17,215
Are you saying

1172
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:18,239
He's trying to reach

1173
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:22,335
Frame them in a way that they can both make money off of I'm laundry

1174
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:25,151
I'm not interested in that

1175
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:26,175
Constantly

1176
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:27,455
Punctures the balloon

1177
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:29,759
Whenever Alex tries to say something like

1178
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:32,319
Soros rounded up dude

1179
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:36,415
He said I like Hitler

1180
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:40,767
Essentially trying to be like I don't want your position

1181
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:43,327
F*** you what I'm saying

1182
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:48,191
Trying to clean this up

1183
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:53,055
The risk of people following ye into right-wing Supremacy

1184
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:54,079
AZ

1185
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:56,127
Getting lower by the second

1186
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:58,175
In the same way that like that

1187
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,479
That so many Star Trek episodes

1188
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:01,759
I like oh

1189
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:04,063
Here's what we got to do all of our weapons

1190
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:10,463
I have no effect on the bad guy what we need to do is take the bad guys energy and redirected towards Eminem

1191
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:14,559
Exactly this is too much

1192
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:17,119
Here's the thing

1193
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:19,935
I think that if you were to

1194
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:20,959
Check in

1195
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:21,983
Non-response

1196
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,519
Division places

1197
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:24,287
Like

1198
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,823
Nick streaming

1199
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:27,103
Platform

1200
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:32,479
IFixit what you need to frame this or you need to look at the size

1201
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:35,807
It's less necessarily about Direct

1202
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:40,159
Ali Khan gay leading people to this really leading people to this

1203
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:40,927
And

1204
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:44,511
Seeing it as an emboldening and

1205
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:46,047
Enabling point

1206
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:47,071
4 people

1207
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:49,631
Who are already of this

1208
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:50,911
To push things

1209
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:51,935
Further

1210
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:58,079
Alexander's going to come on later and the way he describes it is like breaking the Overton window

1211
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:59,103
And that

1212
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:00,895
He's in and of itself

1213
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,687
Probably more dangerous

1214
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:03,967
Then this early

1215
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:04,735
Kanye

1216
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,807
Convincing people that look pretty cool

1217
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:11,135
That isn't necessarily the specific

1218
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:12,415
Concern

1219
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:16,511
That you would have from this interview right it is more of these other

1220
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:18,559
Secondary and tertiary effects

1221
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:19,327
But it has

1222
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:21,631
On an already existing problems

1223
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:24,703
And I understand

1224
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:29,311
I understand where you're going with that and it does seem to make sense strategically

1225
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:30,335
However

1226
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:33,919
There's a reason that the Overton window has not broken

1227
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:37,759
There's a reason why we call it moving be Overton window

1228
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:39,551
You can't break the Overton window

1229
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:40,319
Digtriad

1230
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:42,623
They would love to break the Overton window

1231
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:45,951
That's why we are where we are with Republicans over the past

1232
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:46,975
40 years

1233
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:49,791
Slowly moving ship because I can't

1234
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:56,447
Well here's here's what I would suggest maybe it's possible to break the Overton window and then it can

1235
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:57,471
Can be fixed

1236
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:58,751
We'll see

1237
01:08:59,007 --> 01:08:59,519
Also

1238
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:01,567
Maybe it wasn't in the best interest

1239
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:05,407
Of some of these Republican folks to break in Overton window maybe shifting it

1240
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:07,711
He's actually more what they would want

1241
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:12,319
To do until maybe it's not proof that it can't

1242
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:13,343
Be broken

1243
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:15,391
It's entirely possible

1244
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:18,719
I am telling you I think they're making a huge mistake

1245
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:20,255
Or at least actually

1246
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:23,327
I think we're going to get off great on this one because they f*****

1247
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:30,239
I'm not quite as Sunny about it as as you

1248
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:31,519
So Alex

1249
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:33,823
But one of his great retreats

1250
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:40,223
In times of trouble is head-butted we're just doing a First Amendment thing

1251
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:42,783
Do that and again he doesn't give us

1252
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:44,319
My mission

1253
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:47,391
Off the 1st

1254
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:05,823
Last 10 years

1255
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,687
Evil

1256
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,807
Move here is a kid from Poland

1257
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:17,599
They're supposed

1258
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:19,391
Pay reparations for what

1259
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:21,695
People did hundreds of years ago in this country

1260
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:24,511
Isa divide-and-conquer strategy

1261
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:29,375
Are trying to cause division so

1262
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:42,943
I get to that

1263
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:47,295
Yeah I wouldn't either

1264
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:51,391
Alex is trying so f****** hard to sanitize gay here

1265
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:55,487
He's doing literally everything you can engage just doesn't want it

1266
01:10:55,999 --> 01:11:02,143
Alex doesn't seem to understand that every time he tries to equivocator OfferUp ways to launder the anti-semitic points gaze making

1267
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:05,727
Yay is going to derail it because he means what he saying

1268
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:09,823
He's not playing games like Alex and all these other f****** idiot friends are

1269
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,615
Also hooray for the First Amendment

1270
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:17,503
The government didn't arrest gave her saying any of this s*** in the worst that's going to happen from it is the people are going to say meme

1271
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:19,295
Red deserved things about him

1272
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:22,367
And maybe if you have any sponsors left they could bail on it

1273
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:25,439
None of that violation of free speech at all and if anything

1274
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:31,071
A little bit too much of a free speaking lately

1275
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:34,143
Yeah

1276
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:35,679
Not wise

1277
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:36,959
Not wise choices

1278
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,519
Currently made legal

1279
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:41,311
Free to do

1280
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:43,359
Got to stop bad-mouthing the nut

1281
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:47,199
Yeah man they get bad rap they really do I think it's

1282
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:51,807
Time for us to take a long hard look at the Nazis and Andrea Lee

1283
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:53,087
Focus on the

1284
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:56,159
Sure you know like

1285
01:11:56,671 --> 01:12:00,255
You got to look at it from a Reich half-full approach

1286
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:04,351
Well I'm not that tired all right

1287
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:08,191
Show over if only

1288
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:12,799
So Alex tries to get real personal hereof, because

1289
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:14,847
He really wants to bring home

1290
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:16,639
Do ye that these are

1291
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:17,663
These are

1292
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:19,199
Had folks man

1293
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:21,247
Wasn't good stuff

1294
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,015
Yeah doesn't care

1295
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:27,903
Growing up in the

1296
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:29,695
Richest neighborhood in Dallas

1297
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:33,535
And was a famous German American inventor

1298
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:37,631
The first-generation person who tell me what is little kid on ship

1299

I just like Detroit

1303
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:59,391
And father

1304
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:01,695
Main reason to join the Army or Corey told me

1305
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:07,071
Watch that man quietly

1306
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:08,607
Urgot power

1307
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:09,375
Thirties

1308
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:11,423
Truck

1309
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,703
Coliseum

1310
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:14,495
Kill his relatives in Germany

1311
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:17,567
Blue-eyed German

1312
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:19,871
As you can get is Arnold Schwarzenegger

1313
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:23,455
SS Teutonic as as dramatic

1314
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:26,527
And was my grandfather saw that show

1315
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:28,831
You're opposed to other forces

1316
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:31,903
Other forces in history

1317
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:34,975
Personal experience

1318
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:36,511
What my grandfather

1319
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:40,607
Clyde William Hammond told me that make sense

1320
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:42,399
Not totally

1321
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:43,679
But

1322
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:47,519
Doesn't make sense to me

1323
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:48,799
I'm following

1324
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:49,823
But I was just

1325
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:50,847
Thinking about Satan

1326
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:54,431
They were Hitler

1327
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:55,199
It's not the

1328
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:55,967
Person

1329
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:56,735
It's Satan

1330
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:58,783
Using the people.

1331
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:02,879
But what I'm going to say is

1332
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:05,183
The Jewish media has made us feel like

1333
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:07,487
The Nazis and Hitler have never

1334
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:14,143
Offer anything of value to the world oh oh so the Jewish media has told us not to

1335
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:15,167
Good

1336
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:17,983
Man this is some high-school edgelord s***

1337
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:19,519
Are you coming up with

1338
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:23,359
But isn't that the devil telling it's at telling us not

1339
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:25,407
To believe that Hitler is good

1340
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:31,039
But also isn't heavily possessing the Jewish PDF

1341
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:34,367
In order to say that the devil possessing

1342
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:36,671
Hitler didn't do anything good

1343
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:38,463
Seems against

1344
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,743
The devil's purposes

1345
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:42,303
Now I feel like maybe one problem

1346
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:47,167
We're not that we're not getting that right now is one that Kanye may have just

1347
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:48,959
Elucidated very very clearly

1348
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:52,799
Which is that he does not understand a f****** word anyone is saying to him now

1349
01:14:54,079 --> 01:15:00,223
Andrew just wants to say follow an argument what are you going to convince him of why would you even are

1350
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:03,295
Argue with Kanye he doesn't understand you

1351
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:09,439
It should be taken seriously

1352
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:10,463
Alex said something

1353
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:15,839
Very simple and Kanye said I literally don't understand you I was thinking about Satan and which point you go

1354
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:21,471
Fiber by on some level I really think that that was a I don't care what

1355
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:27,871
You're saying more than I don't understand I don't understand I cannot follow what you are saying

1356
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:29,407
Let me be

1357
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:32,991
So we had to the introduction of Ali Alexander is part of

1358
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:33,759
The crew

1359
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:35,295
There's another guy

1360
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:36,831
Hoes in the mix

1361
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:45,535
Hey Candace Owens

1362
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:48,607
Ben Shapiro's cardio is

1363
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:49,631
Picking up shackle

1364
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:54,751
From here

1365
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:59,871
Now that's an old one

1366
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:01,663
Back to you Alec

1367
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:07,039
Pol

1368
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:09,343
I agree with ya

1369
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:18,047
For those of you who haven't paid close attention to This Owen Benjamin was a shity pretty racist comedian who made

1370
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:20,863
Became a side member of the intellectual dark web

1371
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:26,751
He was like a in the killa bees to the idw's Wu-Tang he was like streetlight for Killah Priest

1372
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:27,775
Nobody was to Intuit

1373
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:34,175
He also frequently hosted the fourth hours Alex's show it was essentially also one of the killa bees of the info

1374
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:35,199
Screw

1375
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:35,967
It's some point

1376
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:40,575
How to get really into Hitler's so Infowars in the IDW both decided it was no good

1377
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:41,599
For business so

1378
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:47,487
He went off to the woods where he did drunk live streams are you talk about how great the Nazis wear and call himself Big Bear

1379
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:54,399
Things didn't get better from there and just the other day Milo posted a picture of Owen wearing a yellow 24j

1380
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,679
Jacket with the caption

1381
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:57,215
Are you getting it yet

1382
01:16:57,983 --> 01:17:04,127
If anyone needs it better spelled out the embarrassing loser Nazis who we all decided we didn't want around or Banda

1383
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:08,223
Together and yeah is acting as a battering ram to bring them back into the public eye

1384
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:14,111
It's dangerous it's unacceptable and no matter how many times you may hear someone try to play this off as a joke

1385
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:15,135
It's not

1386
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:16,927
Also owenbenjamin is pain

1387
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:17,951
Painfully not funny

1388
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:24,607
As a matter of research I decided to watch some of his more recent stand-up and the jokes that they gave his reading their about on Par Four

1389
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:25,631
His talent

1390
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:26,399
Baby

1391
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:28,191
The funniest thing that Owen

1392
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:28,959
I never did

1393
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:34,335
Alicia tan Alex

1394
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:35,359
From the woods

1395
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:37,919
To do today

1396
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:42,271
I was wrong about Alex Jones

1397
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:45,599
A bunch of people told me that he was the shell

1398
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:49,439
And I back them and I was like now he's a good guy now tell Michelle

1399
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:50,719
So I apologize

1400
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:51,743
They should have listened you guys

1401
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:55,839
Terrible

1402
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:57,631
Like legitimately

1403
01:17:58,143 --> 01:17:58,911
Laughable

1404
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:01,727
He won't even be on that because of the juta

1405
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:04,287
Alex Jones

1406
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:08,127
I even text him today I said

1407
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,407
When no one

1408
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:13,503
When no one stood up for you and everyone treated you like garbage

1409
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:15,295
I want on your show

1410
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:16,831
To circle the wagons

1411
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:21,695
When you are flipping out about Rogan I had your back

1412
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:24,255
I said you shouldn't

1413
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:26,559
Your Bridge burning

1414
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:29,887
Business you'll make more money than your fake boner pills

1415
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:32,703
Goodbye

1416
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:35,263
What we should talk no

1417
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:36,799
No no no

1418
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:37,823
You are Ada's

1419
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:38,847
Disgusting

1420
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:40,383
Joe

1421
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:42,431
All the people out there that told me

1422
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:47,295
You know I believe in people until I don't that's just something you have to understand about me

1423
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:50,623
Brother liar

1424
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:51,647
Because of

1425
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:54,975
Like that stats

1426
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:55,743
The fact

1427
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:57,023
He goes all the while

1428
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:02,655
And I'm not even starting a feud with the guy he's so short

1429
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:03,423
Fat

1430
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:04,447
And dumb

1431
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:05,471
And drunk

1432
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:07,263
But like I don't

1433
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:08,031
Can argue

1434
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:14,175
He would call me and ran about Joe Rogan sings his Satanist

1435
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:16,223
He works for the CIA

1436
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:21,599
And I was just did that one time I was having a meal with my family and I said I told my wife I was like

1437
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:23,391
I just have to

1438
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:24,415
Just give me a minute

1439
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:26,975
Is my Friday seems like on hinge

1440
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:32,863
And so I listen to Alex rant on and on and on about Joe Rogan being a Satanist

1441
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:36,703
Because I thought he needed it and then you turned on me

1442
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:39,263
Just because I make fun of juice

1443
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:41,055
So

1444
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:42,591
And I was

1445
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:44,895
I mean you understand Italy

1446
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:46,943
Alex I was very

1447
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:50,783
Decisively standing up for Alex and I apologize you guys were right

1448
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:52,063
All this

1449
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:54,879
Thousands of people that said Alex Jones this shell

1450
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:57,439
He's a sad little man he's a liar

1451
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:58,719
I said no he's not

1452
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:01,535
Agree on things doesn't mean anything

1453
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:03,327
No he's a bad dude

1454
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:06,655
So my bad

1455
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:11,519
Alex hearing on Benjamin's name be brought up should make him a bit worried about ye and Nick

1456
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:12,543
Real intentions

1457
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:14,592
Very least make it clear to him

1458
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:17,920
Do softball attempts to whitewash their bigotry

1459
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:19,968
Reading off Benjamin's jokes

1460
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:22,016
Is in some way a coded Act

1461
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:24,064
That Alex should take to be meaningful

1462
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,624
Because he has history

1463
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:27,904
With Owen

1464
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:29,184
And

1465
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,976
It's not good I mean

1466
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:33,024
Jesus Christ

1467
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:34,816
These are just

1468
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:36,352
Bad people

1469
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:38,656
You like awning on a level of you know you

1470
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,448
You don't try and call P

1471
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:43,264
People evil cuz that dehumanizes

1472
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:45,824
We're going to

1473
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,872
There would be some candidates

1474
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:49,664
It's

1475
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,992
It's an interesting collection of volatile bad Folk

1476
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:55,552
And I mean

1477
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:56,320
There is

1478
01:20:56,576 --> 01:21:02,208
I don't I don't agree with your sort of Sunny disposition towards what the

1479
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:03,744
This portends a little bit

1480
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,840
But if I were to take anything as like a

1481
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:14,496
But this might not be the worst thing ever it's that these people particularly the ones that are rallying

1482
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:15,264
Around

1483
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:16,544
AR

1484
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,312
Not

1485
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:19,360
People who will put up with each

1486
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:22,176
62

1487
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:23,456
Assholes

1488
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:25,760
They will come to head

1489
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:27,808
Butt heads with each other

1490
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:31,392
You can't have this kind of a crew

1491
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:32,928
Of people who have it

1492
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:36,000
Live Well documented histories of burning folks

1493
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:38,048
It's not going to work

1494
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:40,096
Yeah I mean a day. Long-term

1495
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:41,376
It does feel

1496
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:42,144
Like

1497
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:43,424
TV

1498
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,728
Abdication of

1499
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,032
Any and all responsibility from

1500
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:49,056
From Folks at

1501
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:49,824
To deal with this

1502
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:54,688
As also evidence that may be the only people who can kill Nazis

1503
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:56,736
Are are Nazis themselves

1504
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:57,504
You know

1505
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,528
A poetic

1506
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:02,624
You think the things are

1507
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:03,392
Sort of

1508
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:09,792
Handled or managed Uno own Benjamin's marginalized and he's off ranting around a campfire drunk in the woods

1509
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:10,560
Sure

1510
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:16,960
Pirulino apparently he's going to do it someone like yeah he does what he's doing in Owen Benjamin's going to come back around

1511
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:22,336
Milo is a roundly canceled and everybody's sick of his b*******

1512
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:27,456
Mystery brand is no longer right

1513
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:29,760
You do you think you're never going to have to

1514
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:33,344
I hear about him and then now yeah brings him along

1515
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,368
It's so

1516
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:40,000
He is a resurrector e-power for forgotten Nazi

1517
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:43,840
I'm going to tell you this though I don't think those jokes are going to evolve

1518
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:46,144
Owen Benjamin into the next level

1519
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:49,216
So I'm going to throw that out there I don't think those are bringing the Heat

1520
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:52,288
Well it is original jokes didn't either

1521
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:53,312
It's

1522
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:55,104
It's a tradition for him

1523
01:22:55,360 --> 01:23:00,480
So anyway the Nazis are bad man the u.s. is bad to great

1524
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:02,016
People talk about Nazis

1525
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:02,784
Season Hitler

1526
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:03,808
The United States

1527
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,416
Put the Japanese in internment

1528
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:10,976
And you can watch

1529
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:12,256
United

1530
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:14,560
States has Instagram selling pornography

1531
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:16,608
Your feet two little kids and they're selling

1532
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:23,264
He might be preoccupied with your own addiction

1533
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:26,080
Instagram is a prostitution

1534
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:29,152
30 days off

1535
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:30,176
G and is the best

1536
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:34,016
Me getting kicked off of Instagram was the best

1537
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:35,040
Best thing that ever happened

1538
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:36,576
Batumi

1539
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:40,928
Call switches something

1540
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:42,208
That

1541
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,744
Benjamin

1542
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:45,536
You guys got to pull this up

1543
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:47,072
Dave Chappelle

1544
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:48,352
Is a hack

1545
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:49,888
Any

1546
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:55,520
Yep

1547
01:23:58,336 --> 01:24:04,480
I mean I knew Owen use the n-word a lot I didn't know that

1548
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:06,272
Pellet stove

1549
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:12,672
Edward Furlong back in like what was it 93

1550
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:17,536
Owen Benjamin brought together like

1551
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:22,400
Talib Kweli

1552
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:25,216
At a campfire the man

1553
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:26,240
Can you

1554
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:29,312
Oh God stop and think about school then

1555
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:30,848
Stop and think about

1556
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:34,176
The tragedy of Chappelle's block party

1557
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:37,504
The downward trajectory of all of those people

1558
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:42,368
It's all my God they should do like an animal house where are they now thing after

1559
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:47,744
Depresses the only people still good

1560
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:54,400
Are we sure about that I don't even know anymore forever but who knows

1561
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:57,728
I know that's a one of them was named Stickman

1562
01:24:57,984 --> 01:25:02,848
No relation to Bayonne

1563
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:05,152
I want to know he's probably still good

1564
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:07,712
I'm not sure

1565
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:08,992
But yeah

1566
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:14,624
I was just trying to think of more fun ways to pretend that

1567
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:19,232
Pigs that repels skull

1568
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:22,560
18 year old comedy Phenom prodigies

1569
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:25,888
Stole everything from Owen Benjamin

1570
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:30,752
All the statues on Chappelle Show really actually

1571
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:32,032
Yeah that's

1572
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:38,432
You know that pimple and it's really offensive now knowing that Owen Benjamin Road at that's kind of that's f***** up

1573
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:39,968
Just think about your pal man

1574
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:40,992
Not only hack

1575
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:43,808
He also doesn't believe in Jesus

1576
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,024
And I'm supposed to be

1577
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:56,096
His friend

1578
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:57,376
And is that believe

1579
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:58,400
In Jesus

1580
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:00,192
These are the kind of

1581
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:00,960
Leaders

1582
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:03,264
In front of us

1583
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:08,896
Meanwhile

1584
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:09,920
For Christ

1585
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:12,224
You might have had abortions

1586
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:18,624
Doesn't he need to board it right now

1587
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:27,328
Yeah I agree with ye I think that it's time in America has a

1588
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:29,376
Fearless Visionary leader

1589
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:31,680
Christ

1590
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:35,008
Who wants to bring the future for than Engineering in theology

1591
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:36,800
I think it when you look at the

1592
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:40,640
Directions to wear off or night I said this on my show the other week in the news said

1593
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:41,664
Oh he supports

1594
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,432
DeSantis

1595
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:44,224
I said the moderate

1596
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:44,992
Trump

1597
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:51,136
All that the laughter all the sudden

1598
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:51,904
Skylanders

1599
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:58,560
Solve this is rambling nonsense but I want to point out how much of a worm Nick is a smart f****** word

1600
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:05,984
He essentially doesn't speak unless prompted and as soon as ye interrupt him he drops whatever thought he's making

1601
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:06,752
And shuts up

1602
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:13,408
You may notice that he starts just about every sentence with I agree with you

1603
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:15,968
Such a great job of ingratiating yourself here

1604
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:20,320
You should be really worried about that because that is not Nick like

1605
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:23,648
That dude is a leader not a yes-man so if he's a

1606
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:28,512
Luckiest man there's another plan he's working on that you might just be able to land

1607
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:34,656
I will be aware of that is how we're so are you gay

1608
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:39,776
That's if yeah if you if you are letting Nick Fuentes manipulate you your

1609
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:40,544
Dumb

1610
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:41,312
Bien

1611
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:45,664
Well if that's the case is probably quite a few dumb people out there

1612
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:47,456
So Nick

1613
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:50,016
Gets to explaining how Trump and

1614
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:52,064
The scientists are both behold in

1615
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:54,368
Moderate Trump

1616
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:55,648
Versus DeSantis

1617
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:59,232
Any outcome where America orgies

1618
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,304
Israel is rather to Santa

1619
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,072
Kisses mobbed-up

1620
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:04,352
But Israel and Mossad

1621
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:05,888
Donald Trump

1622
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:07,424
His announcement was written by JC

1623
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,472
And Miller who's control by Foreign interests

1624
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:16,128
And they go up against Biden or they go up against Newsome there is exactly zero

1625
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:16,896
Gurochan

1626
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:20,480
Do we get any kind of regime that's going to deliver the real Chainsaw

1627
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:22,528
Say something that's provocative

1628
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,064
Mossad

1629
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:34,816
Going to kill you and take the children away from you

1630
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:37,632
Back to you

But I'm I'm definitely overwhelmed here right now infowars.com tomorrow's news today killing it Alex

1632
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:49,152
Killing it

1633
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:52,224
Pretty watching this going

1634
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:53,760
These guys know what's up

1635
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:58,368
Yeah Benjamin's watching music

1636
01:28:58,624 --> 01:29:03,488
Call my guy everyone's a rip it off on webtoon

1637
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:09,376
Cialix kind of realizes things are a little bit off track so he tries to bring things to the center but unfortunately

1638
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:11,424
Closer you get to the center

1639
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:12,448
The closer you get

1640
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:13,472
To the net

1641
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:16,800
All I'm trying to get through there is

1642
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:21,408
I dropped the Yahoo

1643
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:22,432
So we didn't have to

1644
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:25,248
Yahoo

1645
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:27,552
So

1646
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,024
What you want man

1647
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:48,800
Drill out a fair about that

1648
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:50,592
A big deal

1649
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:56,224
Character

1650
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:01,856
Is this actually here

1651
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:03,392
Bugs

1652
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,168
Damn it doesn't

1653
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:17,472
And then you're the bad guy

1654
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:23,104
White people are inherently bad because they're white

1655
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:24,384
7 years

1656
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:27,200
They open the gate shop so what did they expect

1657
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:28,224
What are the express

1658
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:31,808
Jay was going to be a complete hitch summer because

1659
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:33,856
The white people are bad

1660
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:40,256
All right now come on. Okay Bray, my heart if it was genuine right if it turned out to be

1661
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:41,280
It's not alright

1662
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:45,632
If you took the mask off and doom was still alive

1663
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:46,912
That would be

1664
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:48,448
Ultimate

1665
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:49,472
Do MoMA

1666
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:55,104
You mean Emma do not Viktor Vaughn MF Doom

1667
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:56,640
He is in the past year

1668
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:57,408
Yeah

1669
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:09,952
No I don't think I would help

1670
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:12,512
How long to me how it is

1671
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:17,120
We are supposed to have Alex being like I think what the problem is the left

1672
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:21,984
When this is in response to what are we doing

1673
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:24,032
What is is is

1674
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:25,824
Incredibly anti-Semitic

1675
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:29,920
Puppet act with a fishnet

1676
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:31,968
I noticed I guarantee this

1677
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:33,504
Every headline

1678
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,040
Every single headline

1679
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:41,440
Is going to be something like Yay loves Hitler some b******* like yeah that's that's what a lot of the responses.

1680
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:44,512
All stupid they're all wrong everybody should be ashamed of themselves

1681
01:31:44,768 --> 01:31:46,560
Because what the headline should be

1682
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:49,120
Is yeye brings nut and Yoo-hoo

1683
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:52,192
To make fun of Netanyahu

1684
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:57,312
Right that's it has bad prop work but bad pun work

1685
01:31:57,568 --> 01:32:03,712
Yeah totally clearly struggling with sexual problems

1686
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:07,552
It would also kind of explain

1687
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:09,344
40% of everything that he saying

1688
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,880
I mean he won't stop

1689
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:12,160
I mean

1690
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:13,952
The issue becomes into there is

1691
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:19,072
It does feel like there's something really really personal and very his problem

1692
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:20,352
That's being

1693
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:21,632
The turtles

1694
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:24,448
Hoisted in projected on somebody else

1695
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:27,008
What time is also a classic

1696
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:28,800
Play popular 80's metal

1697
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:29,568
Trope

1698
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:31,104
That that's used

1699
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:32,128
So like

1700
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:34,944
That that two gets murky if you just trying to like

1701
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:41,344
Oh he has a problem with foreign or something already and I'm reading these articles in my head because

1702
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,904
Because I've read so many of them but it's going to be like

1703
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:44,928
On a

1704
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:50,304
Freewheeling interview or on a sometimes disjointed interview

1705
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:54,656
Kanye said that he loves Hitler or something like that instead of being like

1706
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:59,008
This was a ridiculous f****** display of absolute nonsense

1707
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:00,800
With a white supremacist

1708
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:06,432
Just jerking Kanye off while Alex Jones pretends that he's doesn't like

1709
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:09,248
Anti-semitism

1710
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:15,392
But but you know that it is also a strategy of

1711
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,696
Folks who have extreme pain

1712
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:20,512
Bands like this to make themselves laugh.

1713
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:24,352
Because it it it softens and dulls the

1714
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:27,424
You know in the same way that even you were kind of

1715
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:30,496
Succumbing to that inasmuch as like you don't think

1716
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:31,264
Like this is going

1717
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:33,312
Going to be like a pipeline

1718
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:38,176
I think that I think the more that you put the the like

1719
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:40,736
This is serious this is a serious interview

1720
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:41,504
Yay

1721
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:42,784
Says he loves Hitler

1722
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:44,576
The more you're doing

1723
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:45,600
For loving Hitler

1724
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:46,624
Beignets

1725
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:48,160
Because ye

1726
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:52,256
Is making it look like loving Hitler turns you into an insane crazy baby

1727
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:54,560
With dancing around with Nets and Yoo-hoo

1728
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:55,840
That is what

1729
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:58,144
Makes looking Hitler

1730
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,168
Love look like

1731
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:05,824
They're going to make it look like yeah is a f****** out-and-out Hitler lover wouldn't reality he's absolutely loss

1732
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:06,848
Watch this f****** mind

1733
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:13,248
Unless you believe that this is sort of an act of trolling and pranked

1734
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:14,016
To jam

1735
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:15,040
Your s***

1736
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:16,064
Into a place

1737
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:18,624
And make it like

1738
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:21,952
Viewable by y.

1739
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:23,488
Right and that's what they're doing

1740
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:24,256
Right

1741
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:27,072
And that's what the media is helping them do wraps

1742
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:29,632
So this is a

1743
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:31,168
Yeah yours is still a rapper

1744
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:35,008
And this is kind of an ice wrap Bragg

1745
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:36,288
About anti-semitism

1746
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:48,064
ATL

1747
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:55,488
I will I'm singling out here y'all

1748
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,792
We don't know who they are

1749
01:34:58,048 --> 01:35:02,656
Nowata High School know what the word antisemitic

1750
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,496
Definitely talk about the tail

1751
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:12,896
Yeah AP American history no one knew what the word antisemitic man until they found out yeah

1752
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:17,248
He was doing it in 2022 I put them on the map

1753
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:18,016
Except

1754
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:21,344
Great cool not true but also

1755
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:27,744
Talk that way to think about yourself said he invented anti-semitism

1756
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:28,768
Everybody

1757
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:30,048
So Nick

1758
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:33,632
And then something kind of weird happen

1759
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:37,472
The definition of anti-semitism according to the state department is

1760
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:40,288
And you say Jews have any allegiance to Israel

1761
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:41,312
It's anti-Semitic

1762
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:42,336
If you say the juice

1763
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:43,104
Have any kind of

1764
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:45,664
Conspiratorial influencing America tents

1765
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:48,224
So we're supposed to believe that if ROM

1766
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:50,528
The phone and gets on a call with z

1767
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:51,296
And Ari

1768
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:53,344
And they talk about their jobs

1769
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:56,160
Running Hollywood and running the Obama White House

1770
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:57,696
A conspiracy still

1771
01:35:57,952 --> 01:35:59,488
Acknowledge that happens

1772
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:00,768
We're called anti-Semitic

1773
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:01,792
What is the truth

1774
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:05,120
It's a true that they make those calls and it doesn't mean that every Jewish person

1775
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:06,656
But she was like

1776
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:09,472
Laura Loomer

1777
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:16,128
Also it's like basically hide in the under

1778
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:20,480
Their floorboards right now version

1779
01:36:20,736 --> 01:36:21,504
Of the Holocaust

1780
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:23,808
Because there's Jewish people that saw

1781
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:24,832
Call Ira

1782
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:26,112
I was treated and they're like

1783
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:28,160
This guy

1784
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:29,184
Jeff cavins

1785
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:29,952
Opinion

1786
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:30,976
Add calls

1787
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:32,000
Any harm

1788
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:33,792
I didn't harm anyone

1789
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:36,864
I know I spelled it wrong

1790
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:38,656
Because I was drinking alcohol and

1791
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:41,984
Drink right

1792
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:46,080
That's why Elvis died

1793
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:47,360
Basically

1794
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:50,944
Do you know about our getting sued

1795
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:56,064
But if you smell

1796
01:36:56,320 --> 01:37:00,416
Save it some Jewish people have a support for an even $0.02 of allegiance to Israel

1797
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:02,208
It is anti-Semitic the way

1798
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:03,232
People like Nick

1799
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:09,632
Incest that all people who are Jewish should be suspected of having dual Allegiance and that their loyalties aren't with the country they live in

1800
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:11,424
And of which they are acidic

1801
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:16,544
Who's the classic Trope that's been used to alienating ostracize Jews historically and Nick understand

1802
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:20,896
And that this game here is weak Nick is the one who brought up the Japanese internment camp

1803
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:28,320
His example of a conspiracy within the Emmanuel family is equally stupid

1804
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:29,856
Which is what he was bringing up there

1805
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:36,000
Ari is a powerful figure in the entertainment industry but that's not the same thing as running Hollywood

1806
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:40,608
Lincoln saying that because he's a Jewish person in this position of influence where is he wouldn't

1807
01:37:40,864 --> 01:37:44,704
Say the same of a non-jewish person with a similar level of Pot Saint they run Hollywood

1808
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:47,264
Zeke Emanuel wasn't just part of the

1809
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:48,032
Obama tea

1810
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:53,152
He was the chief of the bioethics Department of the NIH from 1998 to 2010

1811
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:56,736
And Rob was Obama's Chief of Staff for about a year-and-a-half

1812
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:58,016
Just after he was elected

1813
01:37:58,528 --> 01:37:59,552
The three of them are

1814
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:05,952
Successful people and are related but Nick has no proof that they called each other and coordinated about how they would control politics

1815
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:06,720
Hollywood

1816
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:07,488
That's

1817
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:10,304
Oculus and it's patently anti-semitic as a suggestion

1818
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,328
Anime

1819
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:13,376
But that's where it makes mine goes and how it works

1820
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:14,400
Yeah I mean

1821
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:15,680
By his own

1822
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:16,704
Reasoning

1823
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:19,008
If there were three white brothers

1824
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:25,664
Doing that then it would be a white people conspiracy and that means that all white people are evil or Van Gogh

1825
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:27,968
Means it is 100% okay for what

1826
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:29,248
To do a conspiracy

1827
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:32,576
I want hundred percent evil for Jewish

1828
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:33,600
See

1829
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:40,000
That's exactly really cool how Alex and ye can Bond over how they did reprehensible things that cost them north of

1830
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:42,304
A billion dollars because they were both drunk

1831
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:44,864
Cool guys to look up to all in all I would say

1832
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:51,776
They're cool cool cool drunk guys I find it I find it hard to

1833
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:53,056
To think of a better

1834
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:54,336
Stop drinking

1835
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:56,128
Message

1836
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:57,920
Kanye at Alex Jones

1837
01:38:58,176 --> 01:39:04,320
Collectively lost several billion dollars all due to drinking and you know what super cool about it

1838
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:10,720
Because it's so cool the way that both of them responded to it by not learning a lesson and continuing to do this

1839
01:39:10,976 --> 01:39:11,744
Same thing

1840
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:17,376
That's really cool. I think the Dare program when I was growing up really lost it

1841
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:18,400
Good example

1842
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:22,496
You know they they they just never had a chance they were dead in infancy

1843
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:24,032
If they were ahead of their time

1844
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:26,592
If only if only

1845
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:28,896
So yeah Laura Loomer ends up calling in

1846
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:29,920
And

1847
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:32,736
She is just chaos

1848
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:37,600
Talking on a speaker phone because he doesn't want to put in earbuds

1849
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:44,000
Maryville they'll get this Heather the people control your ears

1850
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:44,768
Shake It Off

1851
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:47,328
Because of their religion

1852
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:48,096
Are there

1853
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:55,008
George Soros can come to Christ is a possibility that he can convert

1854
01:39:56,544 --> 01:39:58,336
George Soros

1855
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:01,152
Anyone.

1856
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:03,456
Lorelei what's up

1857
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:04,480
This is Laura Loomer

1858
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:13,440
I'm not busy

1859
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:17,024
She called me because she had some concerns about Milo

1860
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:18,048
Running my camp

1861
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:21,888
Can we we got Laurel a number

1862
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:28,544
Port Huron via speakerphone

1863
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:31,360
A phone right now

1864
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:34,432
I can't do a video right now

1865
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:38,528
Is good show

1866
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:39,808
Uno

1867
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:41,088
It's really

1868
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:43,904
It's really just smooth

1869
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:48,768
Produce if you are on the fence about either Hitler or Infowars

1870
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:52,096
This show will really push it towards the pro in both directions

1871
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:55,936
Ghetto I do like that moment that Alex has

1872
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:59,776
How does she have your number

1873
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:06,176
What the f*** is going on here

1874
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:10,784
The reason is because she had contacted him about a concern about Milo

1875
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:17,184
She doesn't trust me

1876
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:21,024
That guy will stab you in the back

1877
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:27,424
Which is completely different from the way I will stab you in the ribs

1878
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:28,960
Nice guy

1879
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:30,240
They're all like

1880
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:31,520
Wrestling tag team

1881
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:38,176
You know they're all like alright we understand that they're eventually going to have to fight each other

1882
01:41:38,432 --> 01:41:39,200
This is

1883
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:40,480
Best setting up

1884
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:44,320
An end to our friendship

1885
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:48,416
So she's going to call back and eventually they don't get her on

1886
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:51,232
Skype or anything it's bugging on speakerphone

1887
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:56,096
Yeah he has some other things you want to talk about particularly a prayer that he's mad about

1888
01:41:56,352 --> 01:41:56,864
Fun

1889
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:59,680
Let's remove this whole conversation of

1890
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:00,960
Morality

1891
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:01,728
Telescope

1892
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:02,752
List

1893
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:03,776
Stick to the Bible say

1894
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:05,824
Either Jesus said so

1895
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:07,616
Or Jesus said no

1896
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:08,384
You dropped this

1897
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:10,432
Or did you said go

1898
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:11,200
ISO

1899
01:42:11,712 --> 01:42:12,736
Said whoa

1900
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:14,528
Profound

1901
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:15,296
Made me

1902
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:16,832
Asurion

1903
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:18,368
What are the album this year

1904
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,160
Jesus said so

1905
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:24,000
Or Jesus said no cuz we want to bring in our creative Direction in our opinion

1906
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:25,280
And our moral compass

1907
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:28,608
Forget the words moral compass is it in the Bible

1908
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:31,936
What did the red letter say they didn't have to say about it

1909
01:42:32,192 --> 01:42:34,240
And then we make our decisions off of that

1910
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:36,800
And then I also

1911
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:42,688
Let's pray directly to God

1912
01:42:45,504 --> 01:42:46,272
And I took it out

1913
01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:52,416
And my family member didn't say anything

1914
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:54,208
And he said here are

1915
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:58,304
And

1916
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:07,264
I know I know

1917
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:08,544
Are you set me up

1918
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,080
Why is my prayer

1919
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:12,128
Thank you for your prayers

1920
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:17,504
Yeah those pretty good prayer

1921
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:19,040
Yay

1922
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:20,832
Even your yay

1923
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:23,904
You can't stand being upstaged at Affleck

1924
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:29,792
Quiet prayer event how is he mad at a prayer

1925
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:36,192
If the point of the prayers. Performative he is literally disiz 8mp makes no sense about it

1926
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:41,056
But he's a he's young and his Christianity is he said

1927
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:43,104
Jesus Walks came out

1928
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:45,920
50 years ago

1929
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:49,248
He's really talked a lot about Jesus

1930
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:56,672
To be samples that he's used his entire career oriented

1931
01:43:56,928 --> 01:44:03,072
I had that impression of him it's not weird just knowing it sort of on a surface level.

1932
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:09,216
Right you know the Jesus how I need Jesus

1933
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:11,776
Crown of Thorns himself though so maybe he thought he was

1934
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:12,800
Jesus at that

1935
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:14,336
Aziz's

1936
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:16,640
Anyway

1937
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:19,968
Goes on to have a

1938
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:23,040
Very long prayer

1939
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:28,928
And I'm not going to make us listen to all of it but I do like Alex's response afterwards

1940
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:31,744
Thank you for blessing

1941
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,072
Bottom of our feet and everywhere in between

1942
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:35,840
The first

1943
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:38,656
What we need

1944
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:41,984
That you have for Elijah we got

1945
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:43,776

Insane asylum world

This is this is Twilight Zone 2.0

1952
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:13,984
Alex has been defeated

1953
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:20,384
Control over what's going to happen I'm Alex Jones

1954
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:23,712
Lost

1955
01:45:23,968 --> 01:45:25,760
Awesome totally lost

1956
01:45:26,016 --> 01:45:31,136
I've tried a few things I have not been successful in sanitizing this gentleman here

Oh my God

1960
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:46,496
I don't know if I've ever seen Alex of that like

1961
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:47,776
Sort of

1962
01:45:48,288 --> 01:45:48,800
Impotent

1963
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:53,152
Yeah that was really really a bummer it reminded me

1964
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:55,200
Of a man

1965
01:45:55,968 --> 01:45:56,480
Who

1966
01:45:56,736 --> 01:46:02,880
Suddenly discovered there were no Tools in his toolbox done after only two or three tulsi's tools work

1967
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:09,280
So well when I'm alone in a secular talking to Liars I should have bought more tools

1968
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:12,608
You talkin to people who are motivated only by Griff

1969
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:18,752
I'm out of tools

1970
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:19,520
Very quick

1971
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:23,872
Decides to go to is playing more special reports

1972
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:26,944
Let's take up some of this time

1973
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:31,808
They play a special report about the ballinciaga

1974
01:46:32,576 --> 01:46:36,160
Cuz apparently there's a new pedophilia scandal

1975
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:37,440
I guess

1976
01:46:37,696 --> 01:46:42,048
I bounced iago's like a like a brand fashion brand of some

1977
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:44,096
I believe

1978
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:47,168
You guys handle it I guess it's like Wayfair but with bags

1979
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:47,936
Sure

1980
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:51,008

Ballinciaga

1984
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:01,248
Is wild

1985
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:02,784
Why is this playing

1986
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:08,160
The same style Bears War featured in one of their last Runway shows which was

1987
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:12,000
Agatha brand were disgusting

1988
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:14,048
But who opened for the show

1989
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:25,056
Yeah Kanye West

1990
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:27,872
Frankie Ayers everybody knows that

1991
01:47:28,384 --> 01:47:33,504
I'm sure he's been through alot I feel for him but let's keep our eyes open yeah

1992
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:34,272
And yet

1993
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:36,832
The majority of us still seem to obsess

1994
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:37,600
Over them

1995
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:38,624
Like royalty

1996
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:45,280
You you sound like my God very weird choice

1997
01:47:47,584 --> 01:47:50,400
I genuinely don't know

1998
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:56,800
I just do either I don't know where I'm at I don't know where we live right I remember when I was young

1999
01:47:57,568 --> 01:47:59,872
That I knew all of this wouldn't happen

2000
01:48:00,128 --> 01:48:02,944
That's all I remember being young I knew

2001
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:04,224
Play My Soul

2002
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:08,064
There is no way that all of what happened after I grew up

2003
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:10,112
What happened

2004
01:48:10,368 --> 01:48:14,208
Yeah there's a lot of surprises that have happened in

2005
01:48:17,024 --> 01:48:23,168
All of the surprise I will say it is a small miracle and a giant piece of good luck that ye wasn't watching that special

2006
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:24,960
Report cuz I should have got

2007
01:48:25,216 --> 01:48:31,360
F****** real quick I was watching at this point on Nick streaming site cuz he has

2008
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:33,408
Hasn't Alex Jones channel on there

2009
01:48:33,664 --> 01:48:35,456
So they play the show

2010
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:36,736
Man the chat was

2011
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:38,528
Furious of course

2012
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:39,808
They thought this was a

2013
01:48:40,064 --> 01:48:46,208
Please set up to make antisemitism look bad

2014
01:48:46,464 --> 01:48:49,536
And he's spewing anti-Semitism and then they play a special report

2015
01:48:49,792 --> 01:48:52,864
Revealing ye himself is also a pedophile

2016
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:55,168
Evil billionaire that was

2017
01:48:55,424 --> 01:48:57,984
Yeah that was there to stab in the back

2018
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:00,288
That thing that's very funny

2019
01:49:00,544 --> 01:49:01,056
Delightful

2020
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:07,200
So he had ye on the whole goal was to talk about

2021
01:49:07,456 --> 01:49:12,064
The dinner with Trump I did not happen because

2022
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:14,880
Who knows what other podcast dinner with Tim

2023
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:16,672
Cool

2024
01:49:16,928 --> 01:49:19,232
Empty the pool drain in the pool

2025
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:21,792
I'm too tired

2026
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:27,680
But some of that conversation gets to happen here and Nick

2027
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:29,472
Has a little bit of a story

2028
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:30,752
About how

2029
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:32,288
It people thought it was a setup

2030
01:49:33,056 --> 01:49:34,080
Trump gave kind of

2031
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:35,616
The standard black voter page

2032
01:49:35,872 --> 01:49:36,384
She talked about

2033
01:49:37,152 --> 01:49:37,664
To use the Opera

2034
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:39,200
Opportunity zones things like that

2035
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:40,992
And then it turned out that

2036
01:49:41,504 --> 01:49:42,528
Ye had asked

2037
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:43,808
Only sent a text

2038
01:49:44,064 --> 01:49:45,344
Message to a lawyer

2039
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:47,392
Cher

2040
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:50,976
And forward him some Intel that Karen gave to us

2041
01:49:51,232 --> 01:49:52,000
That's about how we work

2042
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:53,536
Going to handle the Trump meeting

2043
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:55,072
How to read his body language

2044
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:56,608
The kinds of things that

2045
01:49:56,864 --> 01:49:57,888
Maybe we should avoid

2046
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:04,544
Add that to a lawyer

2047
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,336
Then in the middle of the dinner

2048
01:50:06,592 --> 01:50:07,360
Apparently called

2049
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:08,128
Trump

2050
01:50:08,384 --> 01:50:08,896
To say hey

2051
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:10,432
Karen journos involved

2052
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:12,992
Setup you guys are being setup right now

2053
01:50:14,784 --> 01:50:15,808
Based on a misunderstanding

2054
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:20,160
Do you mind if I sit

2055
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:22,464
Yes you mind

2056
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:24,000
Nick Labonte

2057
01:50:24,768 --> 01:50:27,328
So he was texting I don't mind I don't mind any name

2058
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:30,912
Yeah no s*** buddy

2059
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:37,568
Is a fun naughty Comedy of Errors Nick is describing but there's some people who have been very adamant that

2060
01:50:37,824 --> 01:50:38,848
Mix version of the story is

2061
01:50:39,104 --> 01:50:39,616
Come true

2062
01:50:39,872 --> 01:50:46,016
Karen Giordano is a former Trump aide who was wrangled into attending the dinner by Milo and they knew each other but

2063
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:49,088
Because Giorno had helped with loomer's failed run for Connor

2064
01:50:49,856 --> 01:50:50,880
Apparently Accord

2065
01:50:51,136 --> 01:50:52,928
Burlington Nick she gave some advice

2066
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:55,488
It's about how to handle Trump which ye meant to text

2067
01:50:56,512 --> 01:50:59,584
But accidentally texted texted to Nick Gravante

2068
01:51:00,096 --> 01:51:01,376
Event text

2069
01:51:01,632 --> 01:51:05,984
Did Trump to let him know that it was a setup apparently because your nose out for revenge or something

2070
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:09,056
The problem is that to Gravante has been

2071
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:13,408
Very clear that he didn't tell Trump s*** and Nick has no evidence that this happen

2072
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:14,176
And at all

2073
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:16,992
But that doesn't mean that the dinner wasn't

2074
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:21,600
Gerardo said she said quote

2075
01:51:21,856 --> 01:51:25,696
Milo said that he arranged the dinner just to make Trump's life miserable

2076
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:29,536
He was hoping that news of the dinner would leak and Trump would miss handle it

2077
01:51:30,048 --> 01:51:35,424
Nick Fuentes echoed that sentiment and he said I hate to say it but the chickens are coming home to roost

2078
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:41,824
Also Milo himself told NBC quote I wanted to show Trump the kind of talent he's missing out

2079
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:46,688
By allowing his terrible handlers to dictate who we can and can't hang out with

2080
01:51:46,944 --> 01:51:47,456
Check

2081
01:51:47,712 --> 01:51:53,856
I also wanted to send a message to Trump that he has systematically repeatedly neglected ignored abused the people who

2082
01:51:54,112 --> 01:51:54,880
You love him the most

2083
01:51:55,136 --> 01:51:59,232
The people who put him in office and that kind of behavior comes back to bite you in the end

2084
01:51:59,744 --> 01:52:05,120
I'm here is don't ever associate with any of these people it will end up turning bad at some point they don't have any shame

2085
01:52:05,376 --> 01:52:06,144
I mean

2086
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:06,912
Hugh

2087
01:52:08,448 --> 01:52:09,728
How is it

2088
01:52:09,984 --> 01:52:10,496
Possible

2089
01:52:11,008 --> 01:52:12,032
That that is not

2090
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:13,568
Clear evidence

2091
01:52:13,824 --> 01:52:15,872
It's the Trump should not be allowed anywhere near

2092
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:16,896
Power every

2093
01:52:17,152 --> 01:52:19,456
He got out maneuvered by Nick

2094
01:52:19,712 --> 01:52:21,248
Quintus and Milo yiannopoulos

2095
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:22,528
He is

2096
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:24,576
So f****** stupid

2097
01:52:24,832 --> 01:52:28,416
He walked into a twenty-year-old assholes trap

2098
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:30,208
What a f****** moron

2099
01:52:30,464 --> 01:52:30,976
Anyways

2100
01:52:31,232 --> 01:52:31,744
Who's going to win

2101
01:52:33,024 --> 01:52:34,816
Sunway knickers into white supremacist

2102
01:52:35,072 --> 01:52:35,584
Do you know that

2103
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:45,056
You think whites propellers.

2104
01:52:45,312 --> 01:52:45,824
Catholic

2105
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:49,664
And so I believe that

2106
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:57,344
Well I believe they were all children of God and so I think that black-white

2107
01:52:57,856 --> 01:52:59,648
Brad Brown whatever we are at Ross

2108
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:02,208
Casper created by God

2109
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:03,744
I do believe that

2110
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:05,024
There are races

2111
01:53:06,304 --> 01:53:06,816
People that are white

2112
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:07,584
People there are

2113
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:08,352
Hispanic

2114
01:53:08,608 --> 01:53:09,632
I'm in at least

2115
01:53:09,888 --> 01:53:10,656
Differences mean

2116
01:53:10,912 --> 01:53:13,216
Something to people they mean things to each other

2117
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:17,312
We can't get along that doesn't mean

2118
01:53:21,152 --> 01:53:23,712
How to solve

2119
01:53:23,968 --> 01:53:24,992
The government the economy

2120
01:53:25,504 --> 01:53:26,016
Population

2121
01:53:26,272 --> 01:53:27,040
They want a global government

2122
01:53:27,552 --> 01:53:28,832
They want a globalized economy

2123
01:53:29,344 --> 01:53:30,368
Free trade

2124
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:33,952
Exactly end and the papa

2125
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:34,720
Cancel that in

2126
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:36,000
50 100 years

2127
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:37,024
There are no.

2128
01:53:37,536 --> 01:53:38,816
Nations there's no distinct

2129
01:53:42,144 --> 01:53:42,656
The slave class

2130
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:43,424
Undifferentiated

2131
01:53:44,192 --> 01:53:44,704
That's what they want

2132
01:53:45,472 --> 01:53:46,496
Future president

2133
01:53:46,752 --> 01:53:47,264
Can you talk with you right

2134
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:51,104
Not a chance

2135
01:53:52,128 --> 01:53:56,992
Now he's not old enough listen I will say this right now I'm putting this

2136
01:53:57,248 --> 01:54:02,112
Down I don't care about morality if Nick Fuentes is elected I will kill him

2137
01:54:02,368 --> 01:54:08,512
I will absolutely kill Nick Fuentes if he is elected

2138
01:54:08,768 --> 01:54:12,096
God

2139
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:14,400
And I don't care I'll do my time

2140
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:16,704
I'll do my time forever I'm fine with it

2141
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:18,752
But I will not let this world

2142
01:54:19,008 --> 01:54:20,288
Be run by mcfucking

2143
01:54:21,568 --> 01:54:27,712
I've got is my witness you're speaking in a quite a hypothetical and

2144
01:54:27,968 --> 01:54:30,528
You know that is a pathetic

2145
01:54:30,784 --> 01:54:35,392
I think it will come to this because by the time takes old enough to run I don't think

2146
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:38,208
Think there will be a president

2147
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:44,864
I have collapsed into something or other

2148
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:45,632
I mean

2149
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:48,704
Look there is a Savvy that Nick has that

2150
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:52,288
I think that no matter how bad any of this stuff get

2151
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:54,080
Get with ye

2152
01:54:54,592 --> 01:54:55,872
I don't think that is

2153
01:54:56,128 --> 01:54:57,920
It's going to be a problem for him

2154
01:54:58,176 --> 01:55:00,480
Keeping come out the other side completely fine

2155
01:55:00,736 --> 01:55:06,880
Let people like Ali Alexander Milo and Owen Benjamin return back to their

2156
01:55:07,136 --> 01:55:08,416
Obscurity

2157
01:55:08,672 --> 01:55:09,184
Nick

2158
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:14,304
Has an ability to explain the games that he's involved in any way that doesn't

2159
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:17,888
Hurt his ability to play though it makes people think they're playing it with

2160
01:55:18,144 --> 01:55:23,264
Exactly and there is a way that on the other side of this Nick can say

2161
01:55:23,776 --> 01:55:27,104
I am in the interest of my interest

2162
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:29,152
To advance Christian

2163
01:55:29,408 --> 01:55:32,992
Principles or whatever

2164
01:55:33,248 --> 01:55:35,552
6 star it was something that

2165
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:40,416
Survivability to spread the message of God and Jesus

2166
01:55:40,672 --> 01:55:41,696
Hitler

2167
01:55:41,952 --> 01:55:48,096
He's going to be fine when the white supremacist are like all but you worked with Kanye we like yeah I told you I was using

2168
01:55:48,352 --> 01:55:50,144
Kanye at the black face of white supremacy

2169
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:51,424
Told him

2170
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:57,824
I told everybody what I was doing I'm literally the smartest person in the room because I surround myself

2171
01:55:58,080 --> 01:56:03,968
With the dumbest people on the planet really to come to fruition

2172
01:56:07,808 --> 01:56:12,160
And that's the part that's a particularly troubling about him

2173
01:56:12,672 --> 01:56:13,440
So

2174
01:56:13,696 --> 01:56:15,232
Alex of course it still

2175
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:17,280
Ultimatum

2176
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:20,096
Trump didn't live up to it but Alex decided

2177
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:23,936
You still in the business of supporting him

2178
01:56:24,192 --> 01:56:26,752
I am does heat rise

2179
01:56:27,008 --> 01:56:28,288
Not even do a great job

2180
01:56:29,056 --> 01:56:32,128
You can spare though for Trump that is a political attack

2181
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:37,248
Represent

2182
01:56:37,504 --> 01:56:40,320
Using you guys

2183
01:56:40,832 --> 01:56:41,600
Asthma attack

2184
01:56:41,856 --> 01:56:42,880
They're using us

2185
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:45,440
This guy we never heard of

2186
01:56:45,696 --> 01:56:46,208
DeSantis

2187
01:56:49,024 --> 01:56:49,536
Like

2188
01:56:51,328 --> 01:56:53,632
DeSantis is going to play by the book

2189
01:56:54,144 --> 01:56:55,168
The thing about Trump

2190
01:56:56,192 --> 01:56:56,960
This guy

2191
01:56:58,752 --> 01:57:01,056
One of the best presidents we have his top five president

2192
01:57:01,312 --> 01:57:02,080
He's right there

2193
01:57:02,336 --> 01:57:06,944
Would Ronald Reagan by Milo

2194
01:57:10,784 --> 01:57:11,296
The president

2195
01:57:11,808 --> 01:57:12,832
The Jewish media

2196
01:57:13,088 --> 01:57:13,856
Attacked him

2197
01:57:14,112 --> 01:57:15,648
They were mad because he was

2198
01:57:15,904 --> 01:57:16,672
Actually working

2199
01:57:16,928 --> 01:57:20,256
For the country this meeting

2200
01:57:20,768 --> 01:57:21,280
To try

2201
01:57:23,072 --> 01:57:24,352
She said he's not allowed to meet with

2202
01:57:24,608 --> 01:57:25,632
This is a war

2203
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:28,960
Who are you to stay who the president can meet with

2204
01:57:29,472 --> 01:57:35,616
So I mean you know that he's just throwing around very liberally terms like the Jewish media

2205
01:57:37,152 --> 01:57:37,920
Over

2206
01:57:38,176 --> 01:57:39,456
It's it's

2207
01:57:39,712 --> 01:57:40,480
Alex doesn't

2208
01:57:40,736 --> 01:57:41,248
Really

2209
01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:42,016
Even

2210
01:57:42,272 --> 01:57:43,040
Take any

2211
01:57:43,296 --> 01:57:44,576
It is a bad night

2212
01:57:44,832 --> 01:57:46,880
Throwing around the Jewish media

2213
01:57:47,392 --> 01:57:48,672
That's pretty bad

2214
01:57:49,696 --> 01:57:51,744
Surveys do the terrible job

2215
01:57:52,256 --> 01:57:53,536
Again

2216
01:57:53,792 --> 01:57:57,888
It's not in his Interest really to have a fight or an argument about

2217
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:01,728
It is in his interest to try and sanitize things as best

2218
01:58:01,984 --> 01:58:05,568
Does he try to cover his ass a little bit in case

2219
01:58:05,824 --> 01:58:07,872
There's something that's particularly bad as I got

2220
01:58:08,128 --> 01:58:09,408
Gabby involved

2221
01:58:09,664 --> 01:58:10,176
Like

2222
01:58:10,432 --> 01:58:12,224
You know saying the Nazis were great

2223
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:15,552
I knew this guy who invented air conditioning

2224
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:17,088
Nazis are not good

2225
01:58:18,112 --> 01:58:21,440
Then so he can try to look at a little bit of that

2226
01:58:21,696 --> 01:58:22,976
Dirt off him

2227
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:24,000
It's

2228
01:58:24,256 --> 01:58:25,024
It's not effective

2229
01:58:25,536 --> 01:58:26,816
It's transparent

2230
01:58:27,328 --> 01:58:28,352
But

2231
01:58:29,376 --> 01:58:30,144
You just allows this

2232
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:31,936
Stand up live

2233
01:58:32,192 --> 01:58:33,984
Yeah and again this is too easy

2234
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:37,312
These people are stupid like I mean honestly Alex could

2235
01:58:37,568 --> 01:58:38,592
Alex just be like

2236
01:58:38,848 --> 01:58:41,408
Oh you know what you're right about the Jewish media

2237
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:42,688
Plano

2238
01:58:42,944 --> 01:58:49,088
Who exactly is the Jewish. Like give me Outlets give me names who should we avoid am I the Jewish meat

2239
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:52,160
Oh you're just saying f****** everybody cuz you're an idiot thank you

2240
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:53,184
Moving on

2241
01:58:53,696 --> 01:58:56,768
I think Alex doesn't want to ask for specifics because

2242
01:58:57,024 --> 01:59:01,376
He might be a little worried that Nick would have them

2243
01:59:01,888 --> 01:59:08,032
How do you spell maybe

2244
01:59:09,056 --> 01:59:11,360
But since Nick Nick take this one

2245
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:14,176
When you're in deep water

2246
01:59:14,944 --> 01:59:17,248
So JFK RFK

2247
01:59:18,016 --> 01:59:19,808
Killed by Israel

2248
01:59:20,064 --> 01:59:22,112
Middle East peace

2249
01:59:22,368 --> 01:59:26,208
You have to go to Israel because Israel is the one who has been bombing

2250
01:59:26,464 --> 01:59:26,976
Syria

2251
01:59:27,232 --> 01:59:30,304
Israel's the one that's

2252
01:59:30,816 --> 01:59:33,376
Exactly and that's why they killed JFK and RFK was be

2253
01:59:33,632 --> 01:59:34,144
Because

2254
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:36,704
They were trying to get their wmd program off the ground

2255
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:37,472
Operation

2256
01:59:37,728 --> 01:59:38,240
Nepal

2257
01:59:38,496 --> 01:59:39,776
It was Jack Kennedy that wanted

2258
01:59:40,032 --> 01:59:40,800
Iaea

2259
01:59:44,128 --> 01:59:47,456
That's one of the reasons we need to stay right now

2260
01:59:47,968 --> 01:59:49,248
Aliana

2261
01:59:50,528 --> 01:59:52,064
My both my parents were

2262
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:52,832
Educators right

2263
01:59:53,344 --> 01:59:55,136
And we're here as the educator

2264
01:59:55,904 --> 01:59:56,416
No

2265
01:59:56,928 --> 02:00:02,560
So there's a problem with being the king of conspiracies and actually not really knowing or caring about any of them

2266
02:00:03,072 --> 02:00:07,936
It comes in with his explanation for why JFK and RFK were killed in Alex knows deep down

2267
02:00:08,192 --> 02:00:14,336
He doesn't actually know enough to argue with him so he has to submit and probably is real

2268
02:00:14,848 --> 02:00:20,992
Anyone who listens to Alex's show and pays attention to him and thinks the ship means anything should be offended by that

2269
02:00:21,248 --> 02:00:22,528
Spineless response

2270
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:28,416
Alex has been very clear that his position is the JFK was assassinated because he was going to dissolve the CIA

2271
02:00:28,672 --> 02:00:29,696
Take down the Federal Reserve

2272
02:00:29,952 --> 02:00:30,720
Because he didn't

2273
02:00:30,976 --> 02:00:33,024
Ensign onto operation Northwoods

2274
02:00:33,536 --> 02:00:36,608
At least that's his position when there's no one else there to challenge him

2275
02:00:36,864 --> 02:00:43,008
Whatever anyone else is very getsway Lucerne and pretty much any theories totally probably a big part of this

2276
02:00:44,032 --> 02:00:49,664
Such a f****** fraud has any audience retention is evidence that his listeners aren't actually list

2277
02:00:50,688 --> 02:00:51,968
It's kind of sad

2278
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:52,992
Times ad

2279
02:00:53,248 --> 02:00:54,272
Yeah you know

2280
02:00:54,784 --> 02:00:56,064
One thing that occurs to me

2281
02:00:57,344 --> 02:00:57,856
I

2282
02:00:58,112 --> 02:00:58,624
Think

2283
02:00:58,880 --> 02:00:59,648
Now

2284
02:00:59,904 --> 02:01:03,488
None of us should really be surprised that JFK was assassinated

2285
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:04,512
Because

2286
02:01:04,768 --> 02:01:06,816
There were so many reasons to assassinate

2287
02:01:07,584 --> 02:01:09,632
You know Well everybody's got

2288
02:01:09,888 --> 02:01:12,704
So many readers everybody's got their own reason

2289
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:15,776
This is a man who is begging for assassination prey cracked

2290
02:01:16,288 --> 02:01:18,080
12

2291
02:01:18,336 --> 02:01:20,896
But they're all the stuff we did it cost is assassin

2292
02:01:21,408 --> 02:01:26,272
But those theories about 50 years to come together like it's not like

2293
02:01:26,528 --> 02:01:31,392
The day after if all of these theories were robustly there

2294
02:01:31,648 --> 02:01:32,160
Like

2295
02:01:32,416 --> 02:01:33,184
Yeah Amy big

2296
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:35,744
Major world event you can come up with a hundred different

2297
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:37,024
Explanation

2298
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:40,864
Why something happened

2299
02:01:41,376 --> 02:01:44,192
So gay is an educator

2300
02:01:45,216 --> 02:01:46,752
I don't see how that

2301
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:47,776
Possible no

2302
02:01:48,032 --> 02:01:50,592
But Alex should be a little bit he should take note

2303
02:01:50,848 --> 02:01:53,152
S*** like this and realize like

2304
02:01:53,664 --> 02:01:54,688
This is ideological

2305
02:01:54,944 --> 02:01:56,480
This is not one of your scam but

2306
02:01:57,248 --> 02:01:58,272
Playing along with the six

2307
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:03,136
Like celebrities Viper trying to get media

2308
02:02:03,392 --> 02:02:06,208
We're using our position putting our finances

2309
02:02:09,536 --> 02:02:11,072
Truth out loud

2310
02:02:25,408 --> 02:02:27,200
And say this is Infowars right

2311
02:02:27,456 --> 02:02:28,992
Warriors

2312
02:02:29,248 --> 02:02:31,552
On both sides you and you

2313
02:02:31,808 --> 02:02:33,088
When is Battle for long-time Ally

2314
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:35,392
And we just got to salute you as a Christian

2315
02:02:35,648 --> 02:02:37,952
American because you take away

2316
02:02:38,208 --> 02:02:41,024
Terminator

2317
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:42,816
Happening right now

2318
02:02:43,072 --> 02:02:46,912
I think Alex generally likes to hear stuff like that but maybe today

2319
02:02:47,168 --> 02:02:49,216
But not but not the proudest moment

2320
02:02:49,472 --> 02:02:51,008
No

2321
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:57,408
Hey Alex thanks for walking so I could run and say that Hitler was cool and I like Nazis.

2322
02:02:57,920 --> 02:03:00,480
The Jewish media is run amok

2323
02:03:00,992 --> 02:03:02,528
It's real cool that you guys are

2324
02:03:02,784 --> 02:03:03,296
Get to act like

2325
02:03:04,576 --> 02:03:05,344
I just have

2326
02:03:05,856 --> 02:03:06,368
Sit here and why

2327
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:10,464
Fun fun to get credit for enabling this b*******

2328
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:14,560
So Alex suggests Taylor

2329
02:03:15,072 --> 02:03:15,840
We've all eaten

2330
02:03:16,096 --> 02:03:19,424
Naked

2331
02:03:20,192 --> 02:03:20,960
What will take braces

2332
02:03:26,336 --> 02:03:27,360
And weird

2333
02:03:37,856 --> 02:03:38,368
Jewish

2334
02:03:38,624 --> 02:03:39,136
Banks

2335
02:03:39,648 --> 02:03:43,744
So I want to watch my mail

2336
02:03:44,768 --> 02:03:48,864
I just repo statement but I get this evil next to.

2337
02:03:52,448 --> 02:03:53,216
Oh my goodness

2338
02:03:53,728 --> 02:03:59,872
You can see again Alex's knee-jerk reaction to Yeasayer saying something like the Jewish Banks froze my account

2339
02:04:00,128 --> 02:04:03,200
Rattle off his stock line about how the left says white people are bad

2340
02:04:03,968 --> 02:04:07,296
Is it so bad when CNN's as white people are evil

2341
02:04:07,808 --> 02:04:08,576
You don't even think

2342
02:04:08,832 --> 02:04:11,648
This is pure anti-Semitism deflection reflex

2343
02:04:12,672 --> 02:04:14,208
Again yeah he doesn't care

2344
02:04:14,464 --> 02:04:17,792
He's there to demonize Jewish people support Nazis and pump up Hitler

2345
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:22,400
That's what his entire media campaign is more less about and he is not

2346
02:04:22,656 --> 02:04:24,192
Interested in watering that down

2347
02:04:24,448 --> 02:04:30,592
Like he said in that last clip this isn't about clout for him this is an ideological thing that he believes himself to be a teacher

2348
02:04:30,848 --> 02:04:34,432
Teacher about so no matter how many times Alex tries to both sides of this

2349
02:04:34,688 --> 02:04:35,200
It's going to fail

2350
02:04:35,968 --> 02:04:40,064
Really sad any kind of reveals have few tricks Alex really has are you were saying hello

2351
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:41,088
Deal any tools

2352
02:04:41,344 --> 02:04:43,904
Other couple of go to lines that usually work

2353
02:04:44,416 --> 02:04:47,232
Like when he's alone Orbeez drunkenly yelling at people on the street

2354
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,536
It doesn't really work when you're talkin

2355
02:04:49,792 --> 02:04:50,816
Going to an actual bigger

2356
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:52,608
You don't care

2357
02:04:52,864 --> 02:04:55,424
They're not impressed by your stupid s***

2358
02:04:56,192 --> 02:04:59,008
So this next clip actually really highlights this

2359
02:04:59,264 --> 02:05:01,568
This dichotomy between the two of them

2360
02:05:02,592 --> 02:05:04,640
Evil next 2.

2361
02:05:08,224 --> 02:05:08,992
Oh my goodness

2362
02:05:09,248 --> 02:05:11,296
You just because you don't like one group doesn't mean

2363
02:05:15,392 --> 02:05:15,904
What

2364
02:05:16,928 --> 02:05:19,232
Oh man well I have to disagree with that

2365
02:05:21,536 --> 02:05:23,328
I don't like you either

2366
02:05:24,096 --> 02:05:26,400
I'm a crazy when they were all crazy

2367
02:05:26,656 --> 02:05:27,680
Ann & Hope hours

2368
02:05:27,936 --> 02:05:28,448
Coming down

2369
02:05:28,704 --> 02:05:30,240
This is absolutely lick

2370
02:05:30,752 --> 02:05:33,056
Lit-lit lit-lit lit-lit

2371
02:05:33,312 --> 02:05:35,104
Number one show in the world right now everybody

2372
02:05:38,176 --> 02:05:42,528
Is wearing a facemask Saint ridiculously anti-semitic s*** and reject

2373
02:05:42,784 --> 02:05:44,832
Acting every Lifeline Alex tries to throw them

2374
02:05:45,344 --> 02:05:48,160
He is not interested in maintaining an image or being popular

2375
02:05:48,416 --> 02:05:51,488
Conversely Alex is forcing himself to laugh at yazz dumb s***

2376
02:05:51,744 --> 02:05:54,560
Essentially begging him to just soft in this a little bit

2377
02:05:54,816 --> 02:05:57,632
And celebrating how many viewers have tuned in

2378
02:05:57,888 --> 02:05:58,912
That's what's important

2379
02:05:59,168 --> 02:05:59,680
To Alex

2380
02:05:59,936 --> 02:06:04,800
There are tons of people watching so who cares about the message is being sent what kind of harm is being done yet

2381
02:06:05,056 --> 02:06:08,384
If we can get more viewers by slandering the parents of murdered children

2382
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:10,176
The ends justify the means

2383
02:06:10,688 --> 02:06:16,832
If we can get more eyes on the show by giving an unhinged bigger than his baby racist friend 3 hours on air to say whatever they want

2384
02:06:17,088 --> 02:06:18,368
Well you get the Olympus

2385
02:06:18,624 --> 02:06:20,160
F****** pushback imaginable

2386
02:06:20,416 --> 02:06:23,232
If it's going to sell a few more pills let it rip man

2387
02:06:23,488 --> 02:06:26,816
Let it go this is just a spectacle it's so

2388
02:06:27,328 --> 02:06:32,704
It's cynical that mean yeah I thought I thought that imposing was a freak show this is an absolute f******

2389
02:06:33,216 --> 02:06:35,520
Nightmare this is addictive

2390
02:06:35,776 --> 02:06:40,384
TLC for flux and I understand that we're a ways into our episode here

2391
02:06:40,896 --> 02:06:41,920
But it gets worse

2392
02:06:42,944 --> 02:06:44,480
This isn't as bad as it gets

2393
02:06:45,248 --> 02:06:48,320
This is kind of small potatoes in many ways

2394
02:06:48,832 --> 02:06:49,856
So

2395
02:06:50,112 --> 02:06:52,672
Laura Loomer called earlier

2396
02:06:52,928 --> 02:06:57,792
And they they decided they needed to get her back and so she calls him it's really funny because

2397
02:06:58,304 --> 02:07:01,376
Honestly it just seems like she's she's in a position where she's like

2398
02:07:01,632 --> 02:07:02,144
Hey look

2399
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:03,936
All you people have been cancelled

2400
02:07:04,192 --> 02:07:10,336
I have to

2401
02:07:16,992 --> 02:07:18,016
Call Laura Loomer

2402
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:23,648
Laura Loomer on the way she was originally going to be on earlier

2403
02:07:23,904 --> 02:07:25,184
Yeah your house Michelle go ahead

2404
02:07:27,232 --> 02:07:27,744
Laura

2405
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,280
Did you guys hear Laura on the mic

2406
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:39,264
What they're doing is they're talking to her after I told him 45 minutes

2407
02:07:40,544 --> 02:07:41,568
Can you guys hear her

2408
02:07:44,128 --> 02:07:44,896
Laura Statham

2409
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:50,016
Go ahead

2410
02:07:51,552 --> 02:07:54,368
Sounds outside

2411
02:07:54,624 --> 02:07:55,136
Speakerphone go ahead

2412
02:08:18,944 --> 02:08:21,248
This is a little bit desperate

2413
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:22,272
This is sad

2414
02:08:22,528 --> 02:08:26,624
This is this is you know I think I've mentioned an episode a while back

2415
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:28,160
I think I said this but

2416
02:08:28,672 --> 02:08:29,696
This is the most

2417
02:08:30,464 --> 02:08:36,608
Dark version of the Chris gethard show exactly like the Diddy episode but evil

2418
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:43,776
Yeah there is something to that there's sort of clunky call in

2419
02:08:46,592 --> 02:08:50,688
Is Nick is a human fish

2420
02:08:51,968 --> 02:08:52,992
It's

2421
02:08:53,248 --> 02:08:57,600
Yeah I don't like thinking about that way but yeah I mean it is Public Access

2422
02:08:57,856 --> 02:09:04,000
Henry Lisa it's uncontrolled chaos it's it's bananas

2423
02:09:04,256 --> 02:09:05,280
Is this is bananas

2424
02:09:06,048 --> 02:09:07,072
So

2425
02:09:07,584 --> 02:09:10,656
You know who cares about Laura Loomer butt

2426
02:09:10,912 --> 02:09:12,192
He even loves anus

2427
02:09:12,704 --> 02:09:16,032
What are the ways that he's trying to present this

2428
02:09:16,288 --> 02:09:21,408
A whole thing about loving Nazis involving Hitler is I got

2429
02:09:21,664 --> 02:09:22,432
The Zionist

2430
02:09:22,688 --> 02:09:23,456
Answered

2431
02:09:23,712 --> 02:09:26,528
Bright beats planes this

2432
02:09:26,784 --> 02:09:28,320
A hierarchical power structure

2433
02:09:28,576 --> 02:09:29,088
Chuck-E-Cheese

2434
02:09:29,856 --> 02:09:30,368
I love

2435
02:09:30,624 --> 02:09:31,136
Visayan

2436
02:09:31,648 --> 02:09:32,672
I love the people

2437
02:09:33,184 --> 02:09:33,696
That

2438
02:09:34,208 --> 02:09:34,720
That blocks

2439
02:09:35,232 --> 02:09:37,792
Bank account because God runs the world and uses everyone

2440
02:09:38,048 --> 02:09:39,328
There's a power structure under

2441
02:09:39,584 --> 02:09:40,352
The god that starts

2442
02:09:40,608 --> 02:09:41,888
With the thousand-year-old families

2443
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:42,912
Medicis

2444
02:09:43,168 --> 02:09:44,448
Sorry what now

2445
02:09:44,704 --> 02:09:45,472
The Vatican

2446
02:09:45,984 --> 02:09:46,496
Which is

2447
02:09:46,752 --> 02:09:47,520
In bloodline

2448
02:09:47,776 --> 02:09:49,056
Hi to Peter. Paul

2449
02:09:50,592 --> 02:09:51,872
Financial Group

2450
02:09:52,128 --> 02:09:52,640
BlackRock

2451
02:09:52,896 --> 02:09:53,408
Vanguard

2452
02:09:54,432 --> 02:09:54,944
To the government

2453
02:09:55,456 --> 02:09:56,224
When we can go until

2454
02:09:56,736 --> 02:10:01,344
Putin territory

2455
02:10:03,136 --> 02:10:03,904
Screen to get pass

2456
02:10:04,672 --> 02:10:06,464
And we're just breaking down

2457
02:10:07,744 --> 02:10:08,768
How you doing Ari

2458
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:11,072
Tips are really just sort of

2459
02:10:11,584 --> 02:10:16,448
Uno talk about Ari Emanuel a lot may have just played too much Assassin's Creed

2460
02:10:16,704 --> 02:10:17,472
I think he's just

2461
02:10:17,728 --> 02:10:23,872
Kind of gone a little bit too far with the whole Templars assassin between

2462
02:10:24,128 --> 02:10:30,272
Should be the council 300 Jewish Elders or whatever earlier how does it affect the power structure

2463
02:10:30,528 --> 02:10:33,856
No idea also why is Rahm Emanuel considered part of Hollywood

2464
02:10:34,112 --> 02:10:37,184
I mean I think probably because

2465
02:10:37,696 --> 02:10:38,976
Yay is

2466
02:10:39,232 --> 02:10:41,024
Is incapable of thinking clearly

2467
02:10:42,304 --> 02:10:44,864
He doesn't actually understand what he saying

2468
02:10:45,120 --> 02:10:45,888
Let alone

2469
02:10:46,144 --> 02:10:48,960
Truly believe what it is let me give you another Siri

2470
02:10:49,472 --> 02:10:51,520
Let me give you a round Manuel's Jewish

2471
02:10:53,568 --> 02:10:56,128
So Alex has an idea for a new political party

2472
02:10:57,152 --> 02:10:58,688
First Amendment

2473
02:10:58,944 --> 02:10:59,968
Bill of Rights

2474
02:11:00,224 --> 02:11:00,736
Party

2475
02:11:02,272 --> 02:11:05,088
Party line

2476
02:11:05,344 --> 02:11:06,368
Pro 2 self-defense

2477
02:11:11,232 --> 02:11:12,256
We fix this

2478
02:11:12,768 --> 02:11:13,792
What the word of Christ

2479
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:15,328
The first book

2480
02:11:15,584 --> 02:11:17,120
Of Moses called Genesis

2481
02:11:17,632 --> 02:11:18,400
In the beginning

2482
02:11:18,656 --> 02:11:20,704
God created the heavens and the Earth

2483
02:11:21,728 --> 02:11:23,264
The Earth was without form

2484
02:11:23,776 --> 02:11:24,288
And void

2485
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:25,312
And darkness

2486
02:11:26,080 --> 02:11:26,592
What's on the

2487
02:11:27,616 --> 02:11:28,128
Of the deep

2488
02:11:29,152 --> 02:11:30,176
And a spirit

2489
02:11:30,432 --> 02:11:31,200
Of God

2490
02:11:31,456 --> 02:11:32,224
Was hovering over

2491
02:11:32,992 --> 02:11:33,504
The face

2492
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:34,272
Of the water

2493
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:35,552
That's where we stopped

2494
02:11:37,088 --> 02:11:37,856
And I know that

2495
02:11:39,136 --> 02:11:42,720
Oh okay total Prometheus stole

2496
02:11:43,488 --> 02:11:46,304
Yeah just took out his Bible and started on page one

2497
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:52,704
That's a good way to start I would recommend he continue to read the whole thing

2498
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:53,984
I really kind of put

2499
02:11:54,240 --> 02:11:58,848
Together what it is you think of here is my political party page 1 verse 1

2500
02:11:59,104 --> 02:12:03,200
Beginning was the word lol

2501
02:12:03,712 --> 02:12:05,504
Nick has another idea for a party

2502
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:07,808
Yeah I want to jump in and

2503
02:12:08,064 --> 02:12:11,136
And say that I agree I think though that it's

2504
02:12:11,392 --> 02:12:12,672
It's not so much about the Bill of Rights

2505
02:12:12,928 --> 02:12:14,208
I think it's really more about

2506
02:12:14,464 --> 02:12:16,768
Kanye West

2507
02:12:17,024 --> 02:12:17,536
Christian

2508
02:12:17,792 --> 02:12:20,608
Party chicks off Kanye West

2509
02:12:22,144 --> 02:12:24,448
Brighton and biggest to the nature of

2510
02:12:24,704 --> 02:12:25,472
Judaism

2511
02:12:25,984 --> 02:12:26,752
Which is the fact that

2512
02:12:27,008 --> 02:12:28,288
Jews do not believe the Christ

2513
02:12:28,544 --> 02:12:30,592
Who's the son of God and is back through the only group

2514
02:12:32,128 --> 02:12:34,176
Muslim

2515
02:12:34,688 --> 02:12:36,480
Buddhist Hindu see Jesus as a

2516
02:12:36,736 --> 02:12:37,504
Spiritual figure

2517
02:12:38,016 --> 02:12:39,296
Jews ride in their talmud

2518
02:12:39,552 --> 02:12:40,832
Play Christ is burning in hell

2519
02:12:41,088 --> 02:12:47,232
They they don't like the cross

2520
02:12:47,488 --> 02:12:48,512
He's not really into

2521
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:55,424
It's not the same thing though because the kind of Judaism that we have now is not of the Old Testament itself the rabbinical oral tradition

2522
02:12:55,680 --> 02:12:56,704
So these people are worth

2523
02:13:04,128 --> 02:13:04,640
Oh

2524
02:13:04,896 --> 02:13:11,040
This is a deeply anti-semitic statements Nick is making and Alex's just going to go along with it offering up the people just read the town

2525
02:13:11,296 --> 02:13:12,576
Download for themselves

2526
02:13:12,832 --> 02:13:16,416
This is b******* and Alex's not pushing back in this interview at all he's

2527
02:13:16,672 --> 02:13:17,440
He's fully engaged

2528
02:13:17,952 --> 02:13:23,328
It's just kind of hard to see that at times because his role isn't necessarily to say the same things as gay and Nick

2529
02:13:23,584 --> 02:13:29,728
Needs to give an ineffectual pushback and try to sanitize the things they're saying so people don't see them for what they ask

2530
02:13:29,984 --> 02:13:30,496
We are

2531
02:13:30,752 --> 02:13:33,056
There is definitely been tensions between Jewish groups

2532
02:13:33,312 --> 02:13:36,128
Some Christian groups historically but the stuff in the talmood that Nick

2533
02:13:36,384 --> 02:13:36,896
Talkin about

2534
02:13:37,152 --> 02:13:38,176
Is an old anti-Semitic

2535
02:13:38,432 --> 02:13:38,944
Smear

2536
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:42,784
Emma told me that their references to a magician named Balaam who's

2537
02:13:43,040 --> 02:13:45,088
Remembered for trying to curse Jewish people

2538
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:48,160
These references are understandably not pause

2539
02:13:49,184 --> 02:13:53,536
There were theories at point that history that the mentions of Balaam were coded references to

2540
02:13:53,792 --> 02:13:55,840
Did Jesus but these theories have been debunked

2541
02:13:56,096 --> 02:13:59,936
Yet they are still perpetuated and asserted by anti-semites like Nick

2542
02:14:00,192 --> 02:14:01,728
In order to incite hatred towards

2543
02:14:01,984 --> 02:14:02,496
The Jews

2544
02:14:02,752 --> 02:14:03,520
In Christian

2545
02:14:03,776 --> 02:14:05,824
Here's a passage about Jesus from the table

2546
02:14:06,592 --> 02:14:12,736
The intent of the creator of the world is not within the power of man to comprehend for his ways are not our ways

2547
02:14:12,992 --> 02:14:14,272
Nor are his thoughts are thought

2548
02:14:15,040 --> 02:14:17,344
Ultimately all the Deeds of Jesus of Nazareth

2549
02:14:17,600 --> 02:14:20,672
Nazareth will only serve to prepare the way for mesyac

2550
02:14:20,928 --> 02:14:21,440
Coming

2551
02:14:21,696 --> 02:14:26,048
I am the Improvement of the entire world motivating the Nations to serve God together

2552
02:14:26,816 --> 02:14:29,888
Nick is referencing passages that were about Balaam

2553
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:30,912
Like this one

2554
02:14:31,424 --> 02:14:35,264
Quote the Disciples of Balaam the wicked inherit gehenna

2555
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:37,824
And descend into the nethermost pit

2556
02:14:38,080 --> 02:14:39,616
Gangnam is a Subway

2557
02:14:39,872 --> 02:14:41,664
Synonymous or analogous to hell

2558
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:42,688
InnoTab

2559
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:49,344
He is passing along an old 80's Medics mirror and Alex's literally no ability or interest to engage with what he's doing

2560
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:51,904
Essentially allowing this later to be legitimized

2561
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:53,184
In the eyes of the audience

2562
02:14:53,696 --> 02:14:54,976
They should read it for themselves

2563
02:14:55,744 --> 02:14:57,792
Because Jesus was trying to take over the whole thing

2564
02:14:59,328 --> 02:15:02,656
Yeah I mean it you know now that I know that

2565
02:15:02,912 --> 02:15:04,704
What they're really mad at is a magician

2566
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:07,520
I guess I got to agree with them

2567
02:15:08,032 --> 02:15:08,800
You know because

2568
02:15:09,056 --> 02:15:14,432
What says it's worth murdering an entire race of people more than they made fun of a magician

2569
02:15:15,456 --> 02:15:20,320
In the magician from what I understand is pretty mean to them too soon as much of a dick

2570
02:15:20,832 --> 02:15:21,856
Anyway

2571
02:15:22,368 --> 02:15:24,160
Yay gets to gallon

2572
02:15:24,416 --> 02:15:26,720
I'm complaining about being on drink champ

2573
02:15:26,976 --> 02:15:30,816
Spirit that podcast we said about JJ's Medics and

2574
02:15:32,352 --> 02:15:34,144
You know God loves me so much

2575
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:35,680
He loves me so much right

2576
02:15:35,936 --> 02:15:36,448
Ben

2577
02:15:36,704 --> 02:15:38,496
I go to drink Champs and I'm drinking

2578
02:15:38,752 --> 02:15:39,264
In the Bible

2579
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:40,288
Says King don't drink

2580
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:41,568
Bright

2581
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:43,104
Milo and I'm not

2582
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:44,128
Singing incorrect

2583
02:15:44,384 --> 02:15:44,896
Perfect English

2584
02:15:45,152 --> 02:15:45,664
But

2585
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:46,432
The Bible says

2586
02:15:46,688 --> 02:15:47,200
Kingdom

2587
02:15:47,712 --> 02:15:48,992
And I'm drinking

2588
02:15:49,504 --> 02:15:50,272
And I'm smoking

2589
02:15:53,344 --> 02:15:54,624
I'm tired of these

2590
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:55,392
Fed

2591
02:16:01,536 --> 02:16:02,816
Taking that they gangster

2592
02:16:03,072 --> 02:16:04,608
Wenona High School Meek Mill

2593
02:16:04,864 --> 02:16:06,400
Wheaton High School Puff Daddy

2594
02:16:06,912 --> 02:16:10,752
And everyone thinks that there's so much more gangster like they got me in some way

2595
02:16:11,264 --> 02:16:14,848
Meek Mill went to jail

2596
02:16:16,128 --> 02:16:18,432
Staying at

2597
02:16:18,688 --> 02:16:20,992
Black Sheep

2598
02:16:25,856 --> 02:16:28,160
Please God

2599
02:16:28,416 --> 02:16:33,024
It wasn't the scientist it wasn't the bank's it's God sent me back for the stock

2600
02:16:34,304 --> 02:16:35,072
The fact that

2601
02:16:35,328 --> 02:16:37,632
I still had 400 million + 4

2602
02:16:45,568 --> 02:16:51,712
Yeah man if Alex actually believes that what ye is going through as a jewel Blake trial that he must think that God wants gator

2603
02:16:51,968 --> 02:16:53,760
Maybe really anti-semitic and a piece of s***

2604
02:16:54,016 --> 02:16:56,320
And the devil is trying to tempt him to cut it out

2605
02:16:56,832 --> 02:16:59,904
Or maybe the devil trying to tempt him into finishing thoughts

2606
02:17:00,672 --> 02:17:01,184
What if

2607
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:02,976
What if this is a new job

2608
02:17:03,232 --> 02:17:04,512
But instead of an uplift

2609
02:17:04,768 --> 02:17:06,816
Story it's the one where Jobe loses

2610
02:17:07,072 --> 02:17:07,840
Sinners like

2611
02:17:08,096 --> 02:17:10,144
Dude you're right I will hate the Jews

2612
02:17:10,400 --> 02:17:11,936
This devil guy is dope

2613
02:17:12,192 --> 02:17:13,472
Maybe he met Joe blue

2614
02:17:15,008 --> 02:17:19,616
Morva Joe Blues

2615
02:17:19,872 --> 02:17:20,896
It's babe

2616
02:17:21,408 --> 02:17:27,552
And ye stole or I'm sorry Arrested Development stole mr. banana grabber

2617
02:17:32,672 --> 02:17:34,976
Yeah some more talk about

2618
02:17:35,232 --> 02:17:36,768
Kanye in his

2619
02:17:37,024 --> 02:17:38,816
Drink Champs. And such

2620
02:17:39,072 --> 02:17:41,120
Sure he ended up serving the devil

2621
02:17:41,632 --> 02:17:42,400
You know what's odd

2622
02:17:42,656 --> 02:17:44,960
Is there's this thing that Jesus said

2623
02:17:45,216 --> 02:17:46,752
Blow your mind

2624
02:17:47,008 --> 02:17:53,152
So he was talking about how if you look out and you see somebody with like a big old Timber

2625
02:17:53,408 --> 02:17:53,920
We're like a little

2626
02:17:54,176 --> 02:17:55,968
A little stick in there I you know

2627
02:17:56,480 --> 02:17:56,992
You know you should

2628
02:17:57,248 --> 02:17:59,808
You should worry about the timber in your own f****** I

2629
02:18:00,320 --> 02:18:02,112
Before you start causing problems for other people

2630
02:18:02,368 --> 02:18:08,512
Maybe shut the f****** about other people

2631
02:18:08,768 --> 02:18:12,096
He did I don't think he was serving the devil

2632
02:18:12,352 --> 02:18:17,984
And now user got another rapacity.

2633
02:18:18,240 --> 02:18:19,264
You serving the devil

2634
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:20,800
My wife

2635
02:18:21,056 --> 02:18:21,568
Right

2636
02:18:22,848 --> 02:18:24,384
Family

2637
02:18:24,640 --> 02:18:26,176
Caprice right in the middle of that home

2638
02:18:26,432 --> 02:18:29,760
And I didn't have the say-so over the content that my kids watch and what they

2639
02:18:30,016 --> 02:18:31,296
And what they wore where they went to

2640
02:18:34,112 --> 02:18:36,160
I was frustrated and I let the devil

2641
02:18:36,416 --> 02:18:39,744
Next thing you know

2642
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:41,792
I'm at I'm at New Year's Eve party

2643
02:18:42,304 --> 02:18:42,816
Haven't

2644
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:44,864
I'm the God was

2645
02:18:45,888 --> 02:18:47,680
Mad at me he said

2646
02:18:49,472 --> 02:18:49,984
I gave you

2647
02:18:51,008 --> 02:18:51,520
Skill set

2648
02:18:52,032 --> 02:18:54,848
You like Moses you say Caesars life in battle

2649
02:18:56,128 --> 02:18:57,152
You know

2650
02:18:59,968 --> 02:19:00,992
But your leader gay

2651
02:19:01,248 --> 02:19:03,808
And you're down there you're not representing me

2652
02:19:04,064 --> 02:19:04,832
Drinking

2653
02:19:05,344 --> 02:19:06,368
You're having sex

2654
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:10,464
And you know what he he waited on me he let me go

2655
02:19:10,720 --> 02:19:11,232
You know

2656
02:19:11,744 --> 02:19:13,024
8 months into the year

2657
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:15,072
But it was until I bragged about

2658
02:19:15,328 --> 02:19:15,840
Serving

2659
02:19:17,120 --> 02:19:17,888
With the action

2660
02:19:19,936 --> 02:19:20,448
Set you back now

2661
02:19:20,960 --> 02:19:21,472
I set you straight

2662
02:19:21,984 --> 02:19:22,496
And then

2663
02:19:22,752 --> 02:19:24,288
Moving my school

2664
02:19:24,544 --> 02:19:26,592
Removing the donda theology

2665
02:19:27,104 --> 02:19:28,384
Engineering University

2666
02:19:28,640 --> 02:19:29,408
Church

2667
02:19:30,176 --> 02:19:32,224
And we were there talking with the pastor

2668
02:19:32,736 --> 02:19:34,528
And then a homeless gentleman came in

2669
02:19:38,624 --> 02:19:40,416
Greatest theology

2670
02:19:40,672 --> 02:19:42,464
And I haven't come to a Bible study

2671
02:19:45,280 --> 02:19:46,560
The walk to the house I don't like

2672
02:19:46,816 --> 02:19:51,680
To call it a campaign

2673
02:19:57,056 --> 02:20:03,200
I want you to remind me what I'm saying

2674
02:20:10,624 --> 02:20:14,720
Care about the website I care about Jesus Christ and people knowing that

2675
02:20:15,744 --> 02:20:16,512
Only place

2676
02:20:16,768 --> 02:20:17,536
The phone is in the Bible

2677
02:20:18,560 --> 02:20:20,096
Website is the Bible

2678
02:20:22,656 --> 02:20:23,680
Cozy. LOL

2679
02:20:23,936 --> 02:20:26,240
Nick and the f****** hell

2680
02:20:26,752 --> 02:20:30,080
Mekanix a little bit more interested in that you should also go to

2681
02:20:34,432 --> 02:20:36,736
Little bit

2682
02:20:36,992 --> 02:20:40,064
It's all over the place or something

2683
02:20:40,320 --> 02:20:42,880
Because he had threesomes

2684
02:20:43,136 --> 02:20:43,904
And then

2685
02:20:44,416 --> 02:20:46,976
He met a homeless guy

2686
02:20:47,232 --> 02:20:48,768
We never get the end of the story

2687
02:20:49,024 --> 02:20:51,840
By the way Alex does not remind him but

2688
02:20:52,096 --> 02:20:58,240
Alex was good if I recall correctly first Kanye turned him away

2689
02:20:58,496 --> 02:21:03,872
And then it turned out that he was a witch so he cursed him have to live in the castle for the rest of his life

2690
02:21:04,128 --> 02:21:05,920
Until the flower finally will

2691
02:21:06,176 --> 02:21:12,320
Right yeah you told me on the phone I don't need to hear this again that makes me wonder if it's like a really fun

2692
02:21:12,576 --> 02:21:16,928
F***** up story I'm not going I know ever microwave

2693
02:21:17,440 --> 02:21:21,024
I just want to remind people that when Kanye says he hurt God

2694
02:21:21,280 --> 02:21:22,304
That is not metaphoric

2695
02:21:22,816 --> 02:21:23,840
He'd literally heard that

2696
02:21:24,608 --> 02:21:27,680
I'm not joking that is not slight I've heard God before

2697
02:21:27,936 --> 02:21:29,984
Because bipolar will do that s*** to you

2698
02:21:30,240 --> 02:21:32,288
Auditory hallucination hell yeah baby

2699
02:21:32,544 --> 02:21:33,312
So

2700
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:34,848
Pornobae

2701
02:21:35,360 --> 02:21:36,128
Evil

2702
02:21:36,384 --> 02:21:37,408
According to guide

2703

02:21:46,624 --> 02:21:48,160
I feel you next to me

2710
02:21:48,672 --> 02:21:50,208
Pornography if you're watching a woman

2711
02:21:50,720 --> 02:21:51,232
Have sex

2712
02:21:51,744 --> 02:21:52,512
On camera

2713
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:54,048
He's reliving the

2714
02:21:54,304 --> 02:21:54,816
The trauma

2715
02:21:55,328 --> 02:21:56,096
Of being molested

2716
02:21:57,120 --> 02:21:57,888
Greater majority

2717
02:21:58,144 --> 02:21:58,656
Women that

2718
02:21:58,912 --> 02:21:59,424
End up being

2719
02:21:59,936 --> 02:22:00,704
Stripper is process

2720
02:22:01,216 --> 02:22:01,984
Or

2721
02:22:02,496 --> 02:22:03,008
Sonographer

2722
02:22:05,056 --> 02:22:05,568
The trauma

2723
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:07,872
Experience

2724
02:22:08,384 --> 02:22:09,920
Experiencing pedophilia but

2725
02:22:10,432 --> 02:22:10,944
Sex

2726
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:12,224
Is illegal drugs

2727
02:22:12,736 --> 02:22:13,760
Push to destroy

2728
02:22:14,016 --> 02:22:14,528
Humanity

2729
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:15,552
If you drive down the

2730
02:22:15,808 --> 02:22:17,344
Street in California

2731
02:22:17,856 --> 02:22:18,624
They will be pushing

2732
02:22:18,880 --> 02:22:19,392
Strip clubs

2733
02:22:19,648 --> 02:22:20,672
They're pushing alcohol

2734
02:22:21,184 --> 02:22:21,696
Sex

2735
02:22:22,976 --> 02:22:24,000
This is

2736
02:22:24,768 --> 02:22:25,792
Do for people that have

2737
02:22:26,048 --> 02:22:26,816
This moral code

2738
02:22:28,608 --> 02:22:30,656
Pedophilia but no moral code about

2739
02:22:30,912 --> 02:22:31,680
Strip clubs in Agra

2740
02:22:32,192 --> 02:22:32,960
Sex industry

2741
02:22:33,472 --> 02:22:33,984
It's not what

2742
02:22:34,240 --> 02:22:34,752
The Bible says

2743
02:22:35,008 --> 02:22:35,776
As the Bible says

2744
02:22:36,288 --> 02:22:37,056
That all of that is

2745
02:22:37,568 --> 02:22:38,336
Jesus said

2746
02:22:38,592 --> 02:22:40,384
So or Jesus said no

2747
02:22:40,896 --> 02:22:47,040
I need to over-analyze things but some kind of an issue with boar

2748
02:22:47,808 --> 02:22:53,952
He keeps bringing it up he said that it played a role in destroying his marriage and overall it really seems like sex is a big problem

2749
02:22:54,720 --> 02:22:57,024
His discussion of working for Satan involved

2750
02:22:57,280 --> 02:22:59,840
Threesomes which seems really tame for the devil

2751
02:23:00,096 --> 02:23:03,424
If I had to guess I would assume that there's a bit of a problem when it comes

2752
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:07,008
Impulse control and that it expresses itself through sex and pornography

2753
02:23:07,776 --> 02:23:13,920
Instead of dealing with that going to therapy he's decided to internalize the Neo-Nazi argument to pornography is

2754
02:23:14,176 --> 02:23:15,200
The weapon the Jews use

2755
02:23:15,456 --> 02:23:18,528
The destroy Society

2756
02:23:18,784 --> 02:23:21,600
High-minded idea he's presenting it as a concern

2757
02:23:21,856 --> 02:23:23,392
4 people engaged in sex work

2758
02:23:23,904 --> 02:23:27,488
It's all really stupid but it kind of feels in line with the trend of the things he's saying

2759
02:23:27,744 --> 02:23:33,888
But it's no coincidence that he's fallen in with Milo Nick and Owen Benjamin all three of them are Catholic Bash

2760
02:23:34,144 --> 02:23:36,192
Pissed and followers of e Michael Jones

2761
02:23:36,448 --> 02:23:37,728
Who is one of the most

2762
02:23:37,984 --> 02:23:41,568
High-profile proponents of the Jews attack Society with pornography narrative

2763
02:23:42,336 --> 02:23:42,848
I got all just

2764
02:23:43,104 --> 02:23:44,384
15 more with the

2765
02:23:45,664 --> 02:23:47,456
Pathan trendty has towards

2766
02:23:48,480 --> 02:23:51,040
Just being a b c here's the thing

2767
02:23:51,552 --> 02:23:52,576
Well you're not understanding

2768
02:23:52,832 --> 02:23:54,112
Is that sex workers

2769
02:23:54,368 --> 02:23:55,136
Again

2770
02:23:55,648 --> 02:23:56,160
Like

2771
02:23:56,416 --> 02:23:57,184
All women

2772
02:23:57,440 --> 02:23:58,464
Have experience

2773
02:23:58,720 --> 02:24:00,000
Trauma the hands of men

2774
02:24:00,512 --> 02:24:01,024
So

2775
02:24:01,280 --> 02:24:05,632
What we need to do is take away their independent source of income

2776
02:24:05,888 --> 02:24:10,240
That allows them to exist in their own lives with their own control over themselves

2777
02:24:10,496 --> 02:24:13,312
And then dominate them forever with the Bible

2778
02:24:13,568 --> 02:24:15,872
Yeah it does seem to have

2779
02:24:16,128 --> 02:24:16,896
A bit of

2780
02:24:17,152 --> 02:24:17,920
Prescriptive

2781
02:24:19,712 --> 02:24:21,760
Ideas about how things should go that involve

2782
02:24:22,016 --> 02:24:23,040
Control

2783
02:24:23,296 --> 02:24:26,112
He wants to control everything that his family does

2784
02:24:26,880 --> 02:24:28,672
Normal for

2785
02:24:29,184 --> 02:24:31,488
So they're getting the ballinciaga

2786
02:24:31,744 --> 02:24:34,816
Stuff

2787
02:24:36,096 --> 02:24:37,120
Obviously

2788
02:24:37,632 --> 02:24:40,704
It's it's a big issue because ye was involved with them

2789
02:24:40,960 --> 02:24:42,752
Another the center of this

2790
02:24:43,776 --> 02:24:44,544
Pizzagate

2791
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:46,592
4.0 or whatever we're at now

2792
02:24:46,848 --> 02:24:48,384
Whatever and

2793
02:24:50,944 --> 02:24:51,456
Fraction

2794
02:24:51,712 --> 02:24:52,992
Balenciaga's

2795
02:24:53,248 --> 02:24:55,808
I'm just overall a lot of fashion brand

2796
02:24:56,320 --> 02:24:58,880
Now the stuff come out

2797
02:25:00,160 --> 02:25:02,464
Everyone doesn't start you know I'm friends

2798
02:25:03,488 --> 02:25:04,000
The Hat

2799
02:25:04,256 --> 02:25:04,768
Designer

2800
02:25:07,584 --> 02:25:08,096
I believe

2801
02:25:08,352 --> 02:25:08,864
Is that

2802
02:25:09,376 --> 02:25:10,912
Set up I think it was a hit job

2803
02:25:11,424 --> 02:25:12,704
And now all the sudden

2804
02:25:13,472 --> 02:25:16,544
Everyone is so outraged and focus on Balenciaga

2805
02:25:17,056 --> 02:25:17,568
But then

2806
02:25:17,824 --> 02:25:18,848
Still avoiding our kids

2807
02:25:19,616 --> 02:25:20,640
We're still fornicate

2808
02:25:21,408 --> 02:25:21,920
We're still

2809
02:25:23,456 --> 02:25:26,016
We're still killing each other we're still listen to music that

2810
02:25:26,272 --> 02:25:26,784
Promote

2811
02:25:27,552 --> 02:25:29,856
But we don't we don't wear Balenciaga

2812
02:25:34,464 --> 02:25:37,536
What are you doing you're throwing stones all by God

2813
02:25:37,792 --> 02:25:39,584
We just

2814
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:41,376
We just cheated on our wives

2815
02:25:41,888 --> 02:25:43,680
We just we just fornicated

2816
02:25:43,936 --> 02:25:45,472
We just had threesomes

2817
02:25:45,728 --> 02:25:50,848
We just bought some sex on Instagram

2818
02:25:51,104 --> 02:25:52,384
You don't like Balenciaga

2819
02:25:55,968 --> 02:25:56,480
What's right now

2820
02:25:56,736 --> 02:25:57,248
Shut up

2821
02:25:57,760 --> 02:25:59,296
G is about prostitution

2822
02:26:02,880 --> 02:26:04,160
Is it bad as a pedophile

2823
02:26:04,416 --> 02:26:05,696
Everyone shut up

2824
02:26:07,744 --> 02:26:11,328
I'm listening

2825
02:26:11,840 --> 02:26:15,424
Throw this out there it might be

2826
02:26:15,936 --> 02:26:16,448
Somewhat

2827
02:26:16,960 --> 02:26:17,472
Uncrate

2828
02:26:18,496 --> 02:26:22,080
Batman maybe my interpretation of the Bible is wrong

2829
02:26:22,592 --> 02:26:23,104
Alright

2830
02:26:23,616 --> 02:26:24,384
But

2831
02:26:25,152 --> 02:26:25,664
He seems

2832
02:26:25,920 --> 02:26:27,968
Very interested in his own problem

2833
02:26:28,480 --> 02:26:31,296
And very dismissive towards everyone else's thoughts and

2834
02:26:31,808 --> 02:26:32,832
Well they should just shut up

2835
02:26:33,088 --> 02:26:35,648
That is a good point I hadn't considered that before

2836
02:26:35,904 --> 02:26:42,048
Instagram is basically prostitution because people posts

2837
02:26:42,304 --> 02:26:43,584
Sexual images

2838
02:26:44,096 --> 02:26:46,400
People in swimsuits and what have you

2839
02:26:46,656 --> 02:26:49,472

02:26:57,408 --> 02:27:00,480
Pornographers pedophilia

Call Nelly

2847
02:27:03,296 --> 02:27:06,112
We get a little bit of a talk about something else a different issue

2848
02:27:06,368 --> 02:27:07,648
The namely Ukraine

2849
02:27:08,416 --> 02:27:12,256
What's on your radar because there's a lot

2850
02:27:12,768 --> 02:27:18,656
What is a Bitcoin

2851
02:27:19,424 --> 02:27:23,008
Well yeah in terms of Ukraine and Russia and released

2852
02:27:23,264 --> 02:27:25,568
Seen so much of that in the news I'm of course pro-putin

2853
02:27:26,080 --> 02:27:27,104
I'm very pro-russia

2854
02:27:29,920 --> 02:27:34,272
Yeah we know we know

2855
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:39,392
NFL

2856
02:27:39,648 --> 02:27:42,208
Not not not quite a surprise

2857
02:27:42,720 --> 02:27:43,744
Comically stupid

2858
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:45,280
Dunkirk

2859
02:27:46,304 --> 02:27:47,072
And like I said

2860
02:27:48,096 --> 02:27:49,632
Owen Shroyer shows up

2861
02:27:50,144 --> 02:27:56,288
And so insightful

2862
02:27:56,544 --> 02:28:02,688
Fired black lives matter flag

2863
02:28:03,712 --> 02:28:04,992
He's going to be so inside

2864
02:28:05,504 --> 02:28:06,528
I'll hold my questions

2865
02:28:10,368 --> 02:28:11,648
Transmission right now

2866
02:28:11,904 --> 02:28:14,720
And there's a lot of people sharing their opinions on the internet with

2867
02:28:14,976 --> 02:28:15,744
This right now

2868
02:28:16,768 --> 02:28:19,584
You know I do want to take a step back

2869
02:28:19,840 --> 02:28:22,144
Round with what we're doing here today trying to balance

2870
02:28:22,656 --> 02:28:23,680
Fun and Furious

2871
02:28:24,448 --> 02:28:27,008
Because we are serious people have serious missions and goals

2872
02:28:31,872 --> 02:28:33,664
And when I see the response on the internet

2873
02:28:33,920 --> 02:28:35,968
From the haters in the people getting angry today

2874
02:28:36,224 --> 02:28:37,248
I'm just

2875
02:28:37,504 --> 02:28:38,528
A little perturbed

2876
02:28:39,808 --> 02:28:40,320
Speak

2877
02:28:40,576 --> 02:28:43,904
Let the man speak you may not agree with what he has to say

2878
02:28:44,160 --> 02:28:45,952
Why don't you want him to speak I don't get it

2879
02:28:46,208 --> 02:28:46,976
Same thing with Alex

2880
02:28:47,488 --> 02:28:48,512
Why don't you want Alex

2881
02:28:49,024 --> 02:28:50,560
Speak what is wrong with you

2882
02:28:51,072 --> 02:28:52,352
What the f*** is even saying

2883
02:28:52,608 --> 02:28:54,912
Like first of all this shows neither funny nor Siri

2884
02:28:55,424 --> 02:29:01,568
It's complete pilot bulshit that's intended to mainstream and sanitized incredibly dangerous narratives for the sake of getting Alex more viewers

2885
02:29:02,080 --> 02:29:04,128
It's a shameful exercising nihilism

2886
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:06,944
But zooming out is Owen would say

2887
02:29:07,200 --> 02:29:09,504
Who the f*** is stopping you from speaking

2888
02:29:10,016 --> 02:29:13,600
Some people who are saying that it's f***** up that he's into Hitler on Twitter

2889
02:29:13,856 --> 02:29:16,672
But doesn't have any effect on how much or how little yeah

2890
02:29:16,928 --> 02:29:18,976
Yelling and saying this stuff

2891
02:29:19,488 --> 02:29:24,608
I want to see negative responses to what you're saying and then getting mad at that but he knows it would sound

2892
02:29:24,864 --> 02:29:31,008
Look like an idiot baby if he's just saying that he felt like him and all of his bigoted friends are entitled to only get positive feedback

2893
02:29:31,264 --> 02:29:31,776
Back from people

2894
02:29:32,288 --> 02:29:36,896
Weak and fragile jiri contextualizes it and pretend to people

2895
02:29:37,152 --> 02:29:41,504
Being justifiably offended by what yeah is saying somehow stopping him from speaking

2896
02:29:42,016 --> 02:29:42,528
Pitbull

2897
02:29:42,784 --> 02:29:48,160
Hear stuff like this it's important to recognize that all it is is Owen weaponizing his own insecurities

2898
02:29:48,416 --> 02:29:49,440
Give me the f****** child

2899
02:29:50,208 --> 02:29:51,744
Anyway I lied when I said you was

2900
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,048
Being insightful that was that was kind of

2901
02:29:54,304 --> 02:29:55,072
Kind of a joke

2902
02:29:55,328 --> 02:30:00,448
I find ye Obsession and hatred towards pornography and fornication

2903
02:30:00,960 --> 02:30:01,984
Very ironic

2904
02:30:02,496 --> 02:30:06,848
Considering everybody around him right now is metaphorically

2905
02:30:07,104 --> 02:30:10,432
On their knees with their head bobbing up and down underneath the desk

2906
02:30:10,944 --> 02:30:12,736
Do you know what I'm saying because this is

2907
02:30:12,992 --> 02:30:13,504
Shame

2908
02:30:14,272 --> 02:30:15,040
That's what about you

2909
02:30:15,296 --> 02:30:16,576
Are about this one

2910
02:30:17,344 --> 02:30:19,648
And those people that are out there mad at

2911
02:30:21,440 --> 02:30:22,208
Consciousness

2912
02:30:22,464 --> 02:30:24,768
We have to I have to think okay White lives matter

2913
02:30:25,024 --> 02:30:26,048
I'm going to do a t-shirt

2914
02:30:26,304 --> 02:30:27,072
I'm going to make it

2915
02:30:27,328 --> 02:30:28,096
You understand

2916
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:29,632
Control

2917
02:30:29,888 --> 02:30:34,496
Making people mad outrage going out to streetwear so outrageous

2918
02:30:34,752 --> 02:30:36,544
But you're not doing anything yourself

2919
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:38,080
To change it and follow God

2920
02:30:38,336 --> 02:30:41,152
I'm selling shirts

2921
02:30:41,408 --> 02:30:43,712
A love everyone

2922
02:30:43,968 --> 02:30:44,736
If I Stay

2923
02:30:44,992 --> 02:30:46,016
I love the Zionist

2924
02:30:50,880 --> 02:30:51,904
I do love Hitler

2925
02:30:52,160 --> 02:30:53,440
I do love the scientist

2926
02:30:53,696 --> 02:30:54,208
I love

2927
02:30:54,464 --> 02:30:55,232
Everyone

2928
02:30:55,488 --> 02:30:58,560
The scientists cannot tell me who I can love and not love

2929
02:30:58,816 --> 02:30:59,840
I don't think like that

2930
02:31:00,096 --> 02:31:02,656
I stink more like someone that's on the Spectrum

2931
02:31:02,912 --> 02:31:04,192
Cuz that's what they want to claim

2932
02:31:04,448 --> 02:31:09,312
Well let me be on the spectrum of love because

2933
02:31:12,896 --> 02:31:14,432
I want the job

2934
02:31:15,968 --> 02:31:20,320

Cool

2936
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:23,136
How real is just getting kind of

2937
02:31:23,904 --> 02:31:25,184
A bit repetitive

2938
02:31:26,464 --> 02:31:27,744
Yeah I'm not him though

2939
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:34,144
I find myself not having as much really even to say in terms of like analysis of a lot of this stuff

2940
02:31:35,680 --> 02:31:37,216
They'll hear here this is

2941
02:31:38,752 --> 02:31:41,824
Yeah I mean if we accidentally

2942
02:31:42,080 --> 02:31:45,664
Convince a Bipolar person while they were relatively sane

2943
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:49,504
That they were basically the Messiah and then whenever they went

2944
02:31:49,760 --> 02:31:51,296
To the manic side

2945
02:31:51,552 --> 02:31:52,320
Oops

2946
02:31:52,832 --> 02:31:58,976
We've got an actual Messiah now we're really f*** maybe not whoops for Alex though no I mean he gets a lot

2947
02:31:59,232 --> 02:32:01,280
Free Pub out of it true

2948
02:32:01,536 --> 02:32:03,584
So Allie Alexander shows up

2949
02:32:04,096 --> 02:32:07,936
And he shows that he has pretty like a decent awareness of like

2950
02:32:08,192 --> 02:32:11,008
In studio or on the phone news in studio

2951
02:32:11,264 --> 02:32:14,848
Yeah it's kind of an awareness of like what they're doing

2952
02:32:15,360 --> 02:32:16,128
You can look at this

2953
02:32:16,384 --> 02:32:16,896
Interview

2954
02:32:21,504 --> 02:32:23,296
Play indoors

2955
02:32:23,552 --> 02:32:24,064
Genocide

2956

When he didn't

2957
02:32:25,344 --> 02:32:27,392
You can look at this broadcast and say

2958
02:32:27,648 --> 02:32:29,184
Nicholas

2959
02:32:29,440 --> 02:32:30,976
2324 year old

2960
02:32:31,232 --> 02:32:34,304
You know secret dog whistling KKK Nazi

2961
02:32:36,096 --> 02:32:37,120
You can say that

2962
02:32:40,192 --> 02:32:41,728
What's going on at all

2963
02:32:41,984 --> 02:32:46,336
And we're all just right now

2964
02:32:50,432 --> 02:32:52,736
In the window

2965
02:32:54,016 --> 02:32:54,784
The church is

2966
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:55,552
They close

2967
02:33:04,256 --> 02:33:05,280
Alex

2968
02:33:05,536 --> 02:33:10,656
I want to help fun

2969
02:33:11,936 --> 02:33:15,264
Army truck can afford it either

2970
02:33:19,616 --> 02:33:21,664
Pseudo celebrity

2971
02:33:21,920 --> 02:33:23,968
What's a lute

2972
02:33:35,744 --> 02:33:36,512
And all of these

2973
02:33:38,048 --> 02:33:41,376
Read by people

2974
02:33:42,912 --> 02:33:44,960
I think the

2975
02:33:46,752 --> 02:33:48,800
Take everyone else word

2976
02:33:49,056 --> 02:33:52,384
Only use what they're saying

2977
02:33:53,408 --> 02:33:56,480
Stop relying on the ATL

2978
02:33:59,040 --> 02:33:59,552
Alright

2979
02:34:00,064 --> 02:34:02,368
Alright okay taking care of the big issues there

2980
02:34:02,880 --> 02:34:03,904
But look

2981
02:34:04,160 --> 02:34:05,696
Ali is very

2982
02:34:05,952 --> 02:34:09,024
Clearly aware that what they're doing

2983
02:34:09,536 --> 02:34:10,304
Is

2984
02:34:10,560 --> 02:34:11,584
Basically being like looking

2985
02:34:11,840 --> 02:34:12,608
She didn't work

2986
02:34:12,864 --> 02:34:16,960
The other stuff workout

2987
02:34:17,984 --> 02:34:18,752
Detroit Lions

2988
02:34:19,008 --> 02:34:23,104
What you say we want to kill the Jews I bet more people would agree with us than you think

2989
02:34:23,616 --> 02:34:25,408
Nobody at rethought

2990
02:34:25,920 --> 02:34:26,432
Trump

2991
02:34:26,688 --> 02:34:27,456
Who's going to be

2992
02:34:27,712 --> 02:34:29,248
The exact this is going to work finally

2993
02:34:29,504 --> 02:34:30,016
Didn't work

2994
02:34:30,272 --> 02:34:32,832
Nope didn't work we tried to take over the capitol

2995
02:34:33,088 --> 02:34:33,600
Really,

2996
02:34:33,856 --> 02:34:34,880
Did it go well

2997
02:34:36,928 --> 02:34:37,952
Our last option

2998
02:34:38,464 --> 02:34:39,232
Look at this guy

2999
02:34:39,744 --> 02:34:44,864
We got a celebrity

3000
02:34:45,120 --> 02:34:46,912
So we're trying this now

3001
02:34:47,168 --> 02:34:48,448
Yeah we're trying

3002
02:34:48,704 --> 02:34:49,216
Yay

3003
02:34:49,472 --> 02:34:51,776
Hazard Avenue to political success

3004
02:34:52,032 --> 02:34:54,080
Spell and at very least

3005
02:34:54,336 --> 02:34:56,384
Wreak some sort of vengeance

3006
02:34:56,640 --> 02:35:02,272
On the conservative establishment or the world the world of the right-wing

3007
02:35:02,528 --> 02:35:04,320
That turn their back on these

3008
02:35:05,600 --> 02:35:06,112
Nazis

3009
02:35:06,368 --> 02:35:07,904
Here's Arizona

3010
02:35:09,696 --> 02:35:10,720
To Ali's point

3011
02:35:12,256 --> 02:35:13,792
Maybe

3012
02:35:14,048 --> 02:35:15,072
1 people

3013
02:35:15,328 --> 02:35:16,096
Can rig something

3014
02:35:16,608 --> 02:35:17,376
Or a group

3015
02:35:18,144 --> 02:35:18,912
So many

3016
02:35:19,168 --> 02:35:20,448
Everybody has rigged

3017
02:35:20,704 --> 02:35:21,216
Something

3018
02:35:21,728 --> 02:35:23,776
Then reality that's just the system

3019
02:35:24,288 --> 02:35:25,312
And you're not invited

3020
02:35:26,336 --> 02:35:27,872
Well I do think that I was not invited

3021
02:35:28,384 --> 02:35:30,176
I would like to uninvite him from Allstate

3022
02:35:30,432 --> 02:35:31,712
I would say

3023
02:35:31,968 --> 02:35:32,992
My biggest

3024
02:35:33,248 --> 02:35:34,528
Response to Ali's

3025
02:35:36,064 --> 02:35:37,088
Grow up

3026
02:35:37,600 --> 02:35:39,904
Hanover it girl balled up

3027
02:35:40,160 --> 02:35:42,464
And if I had to serve just read

3028
02:35:42,720 --> 02:35:45,280
Frame what he saying I do be wack

3029
02:35:45,792 --> 02:35:46,816
That's a good one too

3030
02:35:47,072 --> 02:35:50,656
So Kanye talks about

3031
02:35:50,912 --> 02:35:52,960
Excuse me ye talked about his mom

3032
02:35:53,216 --> 02:35:54,240
Dying

3033
02:35:54,752 --> 02:35:57,056
Apparently she was a Zionist sacrifice

3034
02:35:57,824 --> 02:36:00,640
I am

3035
02:36:01,152 --> 02:36:02,176
Believe that

3036
02:36:02,432 --> 02:36:02,944
Michael Jordan's dad

3037
02:36:03,456 --> 02:36:03,968
Sacrifice

3038
02:36:04,480 --> 02:36:04,992
I believe

3039
02:36:05,248 --> 02:36:07,040
Did something happen with Tiger Woods

3040
02:36:08,064 --> 02:36:08,832
My mom

3041
02:36:09,344 --> 02:36:10,368
These are all just a thing

3042
02:36:11,392 --> 02:36:11,904
Sacrifice

3043
02:36:13,184 --> 02:36:13,696
But this is fate

3044
02:36:13,952 --> 02:36:14,720
Waiting at the end of the day

3045
02:36:14,976 --> 02:36:15,488
Is a lot of people

3046
02:36:15,744 --> 02:36:16,512
I feel like we're at the

3047
02:36:16,768 --> 02:36:18,048
Where to buy

3048
02:36:18,816 --> 02:36:19,328
And

3049
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:21,632
Jesus runs the world God Brunswick

3050
02:36:21,888 --> 02:36:23,424
Jesus is the real king of Israel

3051
02:36:24,448 --> 02:36:25,728
And I'm just

3052
02:36:25,984 --> 02:36:27,008
A simple servant

3053
02:36:27,264 --> 02:36:27,776
Of

3054
02:36:28,032 --> 02:36:28,544
Of God

3055
02:36:28,800 --> 02:36:30,080
Zionist sacrifice

3056
02:36:30,592 --> 02:36:33,664
Is apparently on the table now it with no real

3057
02:36:34,688 --> 02:36:38,272
Push back to speak of from Alex about so what you mean by that

3058
02:36:40,064 --> 02:36:42,880
What is a Zionist sacrifice

3059
02:36:43,648 --> 02:36:44,416
Call the sacrifice

3060
02:36:44,672 --> 02:36:48,768
That's what they do sacrifice things to the things

3061
02:36:49,024 --> 02:36:50,560
Turn all the stuff is done

3062
02:36:51,328 --> 02:36:54,400
Sure so if I understand correctly

3063
02:36:55,936 --> 02:37:00,544
That wasn't one of the inciting event that led to Kanye being anti-Semitic

3064
02:37:01,312 --> 02:37:02,080
No it's just

3065
02:37:02,592 --> 02:37:03,360
I think that happen

3066
02:37:03,616 --> 02:37:05,920
Give me the thing with Tiger Woods

3067
02:37:06,176 --> 02:37:08,736
It clearly doesn't even remember that one

3068
02:37:08,992 --> 02:37:13,600
No. That was a pretty low-key Zombie Strike twice.

3069
02:37:15,648 --> 02:37:19,232
Yay seems to be begging celebrities to murder him

3070
02:37:19,744 --> 02:37:21,536
Alright this is weird

3071
02:37:22,304 --> 02:37:23,072
They want a dumbass

3072
02:37:23,328 --> 02:37:23,840
Doubt

3073
02:37:25,120 --> 02:37:25,888
Probably the Louis

3074
02:37:26,144 --> 02:37:26,656
IQ

3075
02:37:26,912 --> 02:37:29,216
You hear of anyone speaking and I'm saying

3076
02:37:30,240 --> 02:37:34,336
Stomach competition I don't want to judge

3077
02:37:34,848 --> 02:37:35,360
Influenced

3080
02:37:41,248 --> 02:37:42,016
Every

3081
02:37:42,528 --> 02:37:43,040
Celebrity

3082
02:37:43,552 --> 02:37:44,064
I did not say

3083
02:37:44,576 --> 02:37:45,344
Celerion

3084
02:37:46,368 --> 02:37:46,880
2

3085
02:37:47,136 --> 02:37:47,904
God bless

3086
02:37:48,160 --> 02:37:50,464
You and you know it's the Christian word of what I really want to say

3087
02:37:50,976 --> 02:37:52,000
Aries celebrities

3088
02:37:52,256 --> 02:37:53,280
Only celebrity

3089
02:37:54,304 --> 02:37:55,072
What is Ray J

3090
02:37:55,328 --> 02:37:57,632
Literally every every one of y'all

3091
02:37:57,888 --> 02:38:01,216
See me when y'all want to see me

3092
02:38:01,472 --> 02:38:04,032
Every fake gangster Stoker

3093
02:38:05,312 --> 02:38:06,848
Basketball

3094
02:38:14,272 --> 02:38:15,296
Now

3095
02:38:17,856 --> 02:38:18,368
See my mom

3096
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:25,280
I'm going to say this though

3097
02:38:27,072 --> 02:38:27,584
You can't touch

3098
02:38:30,144 --> 02:38:30,656
Kiss your ass

3099
02:38:30,912 --> 02:38:31,936
That's not true

3100
02:38:35,008 --> 02:38:40,640
Really really taking the temperature of what was happening and responding to

3101
02:38:40,896 --> 02:38:41,408
Yeah

3102
02:38:41,664 --> 02:38:42,944
Getting back to that important

3103
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:43,712
Yeah

3104
02:38:43,968 --> 02:38:45,504
Yeah I find the the

3105
02:38:45,760 --> 02:38:48,576
The smacking noises that they're making to be very pornographic

3106
02:38:48,832 --> 02:38:49,344
Caswell

3107
02:38:49,600 --> 02:38:50,112
Stop

3108
02:38:50,368 --> 02:38:50,880
It

3109
02:38:52,416 --> 02:38:53,440
He insist

3110
02:38:53,696 --> 02:38:54,976
Dumb

3111
02:38:55,488 --> 02:38:57,792
IQ

3112
02:38:58,048 --> 02:39:01,376
You have the biggest penis to your penis is so big

3113
02:39:01,632 --> 02:39:02,400
She's quite smart himself

3114
02:39:02,656 --> 02:39:04,704
And he's an idiot savant

3115
02:39:04,960 --> 02:39:07,264
You'll never guess what his superpower is

3116
02:39:07,520 --> 02:39:08,288
Jesus

3117
02:39:10,592 --> 02:39:11,616
That's a French word

3118
02:39:11,872 --> 02:39:12,384
An idiot

3119
02:39:14,176 --> 02:39:15,200
Things I know I know

3120
02:39:20,832 --> 02:39:21,344
Cardiology

3121
02:39:26,976 --> 02:39:27,488
Is that

3122
02:39:28,512 --> 02:39:29,280
Is that

3123
02:39:31,328 --> 02:39:37,472
Yasso Oz idiot savant knows is that he always knows what time it is

3124
02:39:37,728 --> 02:39:43,104
Siri show up at the end of this episode

3125
02:39:43,872 --> 02:39:50,016
Imagine imagine that that is a useful power

3126
02:39:52,320 --> 02:39:55,648
Because he's saying that he knows what time is going to be on the clock before he looks at it

3127
02:39:55,904 --> 02:39:56,928
And the existence of the

3128
02:39:57,184 --> 02:39:59,232
The clock renders his power useless

3129
02:40:00,512 --> 02:40:01,792
A bunch of watches

3130
02:40:02,304 --> 02:40:04,352
They're very expensive watches

3131
02:40:04,608 --> 02:40:07,680
So I would see I would feel like he doesn't need those

3132
02:40:07,936 --> 02:40:12,544
He was this Salat to confirm that he has this power

3133
02:40:12,800 --> 02:40:14,336
Sure you always going to be reassured

3134
02:40:15,104 --> 02:40:17,920
So Allie has an interesting

3135
02:40:18,176 --> 02:40:20,736
Sort of policy

3136
02:40:21,504 --> 02:40:27,648
Sorry for laughing at me saying Ellie or something I just had the thought that of Alex that no one man should have

3137
02:40:27,904 --> 02:40:28,416
Have all that power

3138
02:40:28,928 --> 02:40:30,720
I should be able to tell what time it is

3139
02:40:32,512 --> 02:40:35,328
It is very ripe for abuse

3140
02:40:36,096 --> 02:40:37,632
So Elizabeth

3141
02:40:43,264 --> 02:40:44,032
Laura Loomer

3142
02:40:45,568 --> 02:40:48,128
Zionist

3143
02:40:54,016 --> 02:40:55,296
We disagree with Nick and I

3144
02:41:06,304 --> 02:41:07,328
Raymore power

3145
02:41:08,096 --> 02:41:12,448
Free speech

3146
02:41:18,080 --> 02:41:19,104
On his giant

3147
02:41:23,200 --> 02:41:25,760
Put out for my Twitter hi Ari Emanuel

3148
02:41:28,576 --> 02:41:31,904
No I got Ally you are such a loser

3149
02:41:32,160 --> 02:41:35,232
I mean this is supposed to be a free-speech pageant

3150
02:41:35,488 --> 02:41:41,632
I know basically advocating for on behalf of naked

3151
02:41:43,424 --> 02:41:44,448
What I would like

3152
02:41:44,704 --> 02:41:49,568
Is Sharia law now I know that we've talked in the past about how it's bad

3153
02:41:49,824 --> 02:41:52,384
But have you considered beheading people who say got some

3154
02:41:52,896 --> 02:41:59,040
Dim the little weird

3155
02:41:59,296 --> 02:41:59,808
Little too far but

3156
02:42:00,064 --> 02:42:00,576
You get used to

3157
02:42:00,832 --> 02:42:02,112
How exciting is it

3158
02:42:02,624 --> 02:42:04,672
That ye is going to let Alex tweet

3159
02:42:05,184 --> 02:42:10,048
Yeah I mean it is it is funny that we have to interrupt your belief

3160
02:42:10,304 --> 02:42:11,328
Blasphemy should be X

3161
02:42:11,584 --> 02:42:12,096
Executable

3162
02:42:12,352 --> 02:42:13,120
Hi with

3163
02:42:13,376 --> 02:42:17,984
Tweet from Kanye's Twitter account he didn't say what the exact punished

3164
02:42:18,240 --> 02:42:20,032
Maywood

3165
02:42:20,288 --> 02:42:23,360
I mean I know what a blasphemy lies and it doesn't end well

3166
02:42:23,616 --> 02:42:28,736
Somebody is usually pretty pissed off about glasser's chillblast

3167
02:42:30,016 --> 02:42:30,784
Anyway

3168
02:42:31,040 --> 02:42:33,856
Alex's Pizza

3169
02:42:36,928 --> 02:42:38,976
Abbott waited so long I remember how this works

3170
02:42:41,536 --> 02:42:43,584
Alright so this is the Yankees phone here

3171
02:42:44,608 --> 02:42:46,144
And I was going to say I

3172
02:42:49,216 --> 02:42:49,728
Don't.

3173
02:42:49,984 --> 02:42:50,496
Mom

3174
02:42:50,752 --> 02:42:51,264
Love

3175
02:42:51,520 --> 02:42:52,544
DJ Juice

3176
02:42:57,408 --> 02:42:57,920
First

3177
02:42:58,944 --> 02:43:00,224
How do you say OMG

3178
02:43:00,992 --> 02:43:01,760
Abbreviation

3179
02:43:05,600 --> 02:43:06,112
Yeah I got

3180
02:43:06,880 --> 02:43:07,904
I love the First Amendment

3181
02:43:08,160 --> 02:43:14,304
See if the fun things right between right after Ali was advocating for for blasphemy laws

3182
02:43:14,560 --> 02:43:18,912
First Amendment however that shouldn't count against God because there should be a one world religion and its

3183
02:43:19,168 --> 02:43:22,240
I didn't have any problem with or even a response

3184
02:43:22,496 --> 02:43:23,776
The alley saying that

3185
02:43:24,032 --> 02:43:26,848
I love the first Batman

3186
02:43:27,104 --> 02:43:30,176
They are so giddy cuz they pass the phone around they all

3187
02:43:30,432 --> 02:43:31,456
Get tweet from

3188
02:43:31,712 --> 02:43:37,856
EA account amount of strfkr pathetic bulshit that these people engage in

3189
02:43:38,112 --> 02:43:39,648
About the same time pretending that they

3190
02:43:39,904 --> 02:43:41,952
Are at any sense of the word

3191
02:43:42,208 --> 02:43:46,816
A powerful man f*** off

3192
02:43:47,072 --> 02:43:47,840
Meanwhile

3193
02:43:48,352 --> 02:43:53,472
Yeah he continues to be obsessed with our emanuel's wife

3194
02:43:53,728 --> 02:43:59,872
Jerking Kanye West off nonstop and ye is just out here to do whatever you f****** want

3195
02:44:00,128 --> 02:44:04,736
Weirdly and sort of vaguely sexually threatened Aria that is wife

3196
02:44:05,504 --> 02:44:11,648
Rema well if your wife needs any help on her creative direction for Align

3197
02:44:13,184 --> 02:44:13,696
Even though you

3198
02:44:13,952 --> 02:44:14,976
You tried to destroy my life

3199
02:44:15,488 --> 02:44:16,512
I will help your wife

3200
02:44:16,768 --> 02:44:17,280
On the creative

3201
02:44:17,536 --> 02:44:20,096
Directions and I will not do anything on Chris

3202
02:44:20,608 --> 02:44:21,632
When we were in the room together

3203
02:44:21,888 --> 02:44:22,656
In Jesus name

3204
02:44:23,168 --> 02:44:27,520
Re if you wait which Christian help your wife with her life

3205
02:44:27,776 --> 02:44:28,288
Okay

3206
02:44:30,080 --> 02:44:30,848
I put on Christ

3207
02:44:31,872 --> 02:44:32,384
America first

3208
02:44:32,640 --> 02:44:33,152
Groyper

3209
02:44:35,456 --> 02:44:36,480
Beautiful

3210
02:44:36,736 --> 02:44:38,528
Did you put the Infowars

3211
02:44:39,808 --> 02:44:43,392
Alexander Twitter

3212
02:44:43,648 --> 02:44:46,208
He did have his Twitter

3213
02:44:46,464 --> 02:44:46,976
Suspended

3214
02:44:47,232 --> 02:44:49,792
Not for this I don't think but a little bit after this

3215
02:44:50,048 --> 02:44:52,352
Elon kicked it back alive

3216
02:44:53,120 --> 02:44:54,912
So anyway Barrel

3217
02:44:55,168 --> 02:45:01,312
So excited to tweet and then Alex a happy so he leaves

3218
02:45:01,568 --> 02:45:05,152
That's the smartest thing you've done this I will say

3219
02:45:05,408 --> 02:45:07,968
I've been pretty critical of Alec

3220
02:45:09,760 --> 02:45:10,272
What

3221
02:45:10,528 --> 02:45:14,112
The show does grind to a halt when he leaves

3222
02:45:14,368 --> 02:45:18,464
Is brutal it's not very long

3223
02:45:18,720 --> 02:45:20,000
But there is a

3224
02:45:20,256 --> 02:45:20,768
Drop

3225
02:45:21,024 --> 02:45:24,864
In energy I don't know exactly why these are all people who love to talk

3226
02:45:25,120 --> 02:45:25,888
Yeah but

3227
02:45:26,144 --> 02:45:28,960
Sump for some reason it just does not work out until

3228
02:45:29,472 --> 02:45:31,520
Ali starts doing a little bit Improv

3229
02:45:32,288 --> 02:45:32,800
Free

3230
02:45:33,568 --> 02:45:34,080
Alex

3231
02:45:35,872 --> 02:45:36,384
Free

3232
02:45:37,408 --> 02:45:37,920
Nick

3233
02:45:39,712 --> 02:45:40,224
Nicholas

3234
02:45:41,248 --> 02:45:41,760
Free

3235
02:45:42,016 --> 02:45:43,552
Free

3236
02:45:44,320 --> 02:45:44,832
Beat

3237
02:45:47,392 --> 02:45:47,904
Free Ali

3238
02:45:48,672 --> 02:45:49,440
Is the level of typing

3239
02:45:50,976 --> 02:45:51,488
Boombayah

3240
02:45:52,256 --> 02:45:52,768
Boombayah

3241
02:45:56,864 --> 02:45:57,376
Yeah it's

3242
02:45:59,680 --> 02:46:00,192
Duncan Auto

3243
02:46:02,752 --> 02:46:06,335
I hate all of yourself

3244
02:46:24,511 --> 02:46:25,279
Sometime

3245
02:46:38,591 --> 02:46:42,431
It's at there's kind of the the feeling of

3246
02:46:42,687 --> 02:46:44,479
A kid who no one really likes

3247
02:46:44,735 --> 02:46:45,247
Yeah but has

3248
02:46:45,503 --> 02:46:46,527
Cool stuff

3249
02:46:46,783 --> 02:46:49,087
I'm so people are kind of

3250
02:46:49,343 --> 02:46:51,903
Using him to get that stuff

3251
02:46:52,159 --> 02:46:54,975
Yeah and then when he's out of the room they kind of make fun of him

3252
02:46:55,231 --> 02:46:56,511
But they're alive

3253
02:46:59,583 --> 02:47:01,375
That's the kind of vibe

3254
02:47:01,631 --> 02:47:02,399
This gives

3255
02:47:02,655 --> 02:47:05,215
Also when he said the mask there's a Alex Bass

3256
02:47:05,471 --> 02:47:08,543
Ya Ali puts that on to pretend

3257
02:47:08,799 --> 02:47:10,335
Neuromancer

3258
02:47:10,847 --> 02:47:14,943
I mean it's a impression that I would certainly do but I would be insulting a

3259
02:47:15,199 --> 02:47:17,247
Right and I believe it is a little bit insult

3260
02:47:17,503 --> 02:47:20,063
I mean if you step back though

3261
02:47:20,319 --> 02:47:21,599
There is something

3262
02:47:21,855 --> 02:47:23,391
Very Progressive

3263
02:47:23,903 --> 02:47:24,415
About

3264
02:47:24,671 --> 02:47:26,719
Black man in America

3265
02:47:27,231 --> 02:47:29,279
Forcing white supremacist to dance for him

3266
02:47:29,535 --> 02:47:31,071
That's kind of powerful

3267
02:47:31,583 --> 02:47:32,095
You know

3268
02:47:33,631 --> 02:47:36,191
Nap maybe I mean

3269
02:47:36,447 --> 02:47:36,959
Whatever

3270
02:47:37,215 --> 02:47:42,079
Anyway there's a big audience and Alex is really excited about it so he wants ye to give a message

3271
02:47:42,847 --> 02:47:43,615
Here's what he chooses

3272
02:47:44,639 --> 02:47:45,919
Who knows maybe Kanye West

3273
02:47:47,199 --> 02:47:48,223
Was never here

3274
02:47:52,575 --> 02:47:53,343
15 years

3275
02:47:54,879 --> 02:47:57,439
Brother calls Kanye better

3276
02:48:04,095 --> 02:48:05,631
Super-mega total viral

3277
02:48:05,887 --> 02:48:07,423
What is your message to Trump right now

3278
02:48:09,471 --> 02:48:10,751
What's your message to the Santa's right now

3279
02:48:11,775 --> 02:48:12,287
I don't know who the

3280
02:48:12,543 --> 02:48:13,567
DeSantis isn't ever heard of the

3281
02:48:20,991 --> 02:48:21,503
No I hear you

3282
02:48:23,295 --> 02:48:29,183
I love you

3283
02:48:29,439 --> 02:48:31,231
His name is Ronald can I lick your feet

3284
02:48:33,279 --> 02:48:34,047
So Nick

3285
02:48:34,815 --> 02:48:35,583
Not a white

3286
02:48:37,375 --> 02:48:38,655
It's like we love Trump

3287
02:48:39,167 --> 02:48:39,935
We love ye

3288
02:48:41,471 --> 02:48:45,055
That's right yeah no I'm with UTA and Trump and anybody gone for two

3289
02:48:45,311 --> 02:48:46,591
DeSantis or McCarthy

3290
02:48:47,871 --> 02:48:51,967
It's not the energy that's not divided that's not Maga that's not Jesus energy

3291
02:48:52,223 --> 02:48:56,575
Dragon energy

3292
02:48:57,087 --> 02:48:58,111
Put it all on the line

3293
02:48:58,367 --> 02:48:59,135
And finally tell the

3294
02:49:00,159 --> 02:49:02,207
That's the problem

3295
02:49:03,231 --> 02:49:04,255
I've heard you're a senior show

3296
02:49:09,119 --> 02:49:10,655
It's a load of crap

3297
02:49:11,167 --> 02:49:13,727
Yeah and I

3298
02:49:13,983 --> 02:49:15,775
Okay well then I would

3299
02:49:18,335 --> 02:49:22,687
ATL I want to say there's a lot of good Nazis that were just fighting for their country

3300
02:49:23,199 --> 02:49:23,967
Infidel

3301
02:49:29,343 --> 02:49:29,855
OtterBox

3302
02:49:30,623 --> 02:49:31,647
Every Nazi

3303
02:49:31,903 --> 02:49:32,415
Bad

3304
02:49:32,927 --> 02:49:34,207
Pitstop

3305
02:49:34,719 --> 02:49:35,743
Justin fighting for the

3306
02:49:35,999 --> 02:49:37,791
Country

3307
02:49:38,047 --> 02:49:39,583
All in a box

3308
02:49:39,839 --> 02:49:42,911
Again Alex is trying to do that Soros reflex

3309
02:49:43,167 --> 02:49:44,959
Xpeng deflection

3310
02:49:45,215 --> 02:49:47,519
Part of it

3311
02:49:48,031 --> 02:49:51,103
They're good Nazis maybe Soros is good I guess

3312
02:49:52,383 --> 02:49:54,175
It's up in the air

3313
02:49:54,431 --> 02:49:56,735
God's up in the air man you never know

3314
02:49:57,759 --> 02:49:59,295
He's having this trouble

3315
02:49:59,551 --> 02:50:05,695
With his deflections now being accepted he tries to explain that Hitler was a

3316
02:50:05,951 --> 02:50:08,511
Bad dude interesting let's see how this goes

3317
02:50:09,023 --> 02:50:09,535
Southern work

3318
02:50:16,959 --> 02:50:18,751
The the Hugo Boss uniform

3319
02:50:20,031 --> 02:50:22,591
But I mean designer

3320
02:50:22,847 --> 02:50:23,871
Can we just kind of stay

3321
02:50:24,127 --> 02:50:24,639
Like you like that

3322
02:50:25,919 --> 02:50:27,455
But that's about it

3323
02:50:29,247 --> 02:50:30,015
Things that I

3324
02:50:31,551 --> 02:50:32,063
About him

3325
02:50:33,343 --> 02:50:35,135
A lot of things

3326
02:50:44,095 --> 02:50:47,423
How could you say something it's okay then

3327
02:50:50,751 --> 02:50:52,031
They support zelensky

3328
02:50:55,103 --> 02:50:55,871
I love

3329
02:50:56,127 --> 02:50:57,407
Everyone

3330
02:50:57,663 --> 02:51:03,807
You're not going to be able to trap them with us I love everyone

3331
02:51:04,319 --> 02:51:10,463
This doesn't make sense how by your logic none of what he's saying makes sense or means anything he could be say

3332
02:51:10,719 --> 02:51:14,047
Sing any words right now who have the same thing to a fish

3333
02:51:14,303 --> 02:51:19,423
Absolutely this is this if I was writing a parody character

3334
02:51:19,679 --> 02:51:20,703
And I have

3335
02:51:21,215 --> 02:51:22,239
Over Nazi

3336
02:51:22,495 --> 02:51:24,799
Who says exactly what they believe

3337
02:51:25,055 --> 02:51:28,383
I wouldn't get this ridiculous it's unbelievable

3338
02:51:28,895 --> 02:51:30,175
Yeah yeah it's

3339
02:51:30,431 --> 02:51:32,223
It's pretty pretty silly

3340
02:51:32,479 --> 02:51:34,271
But that again masks

3341
02:51:34,527 --> 02:51:36,831
We be dangerous

3342
02:51:37,087 --> 02:51:40,927
Toxicity of the actual ideas that are being put forth

3343
02:51:41,439 --> 02:51:42,207
So

3344
02:51:42,975 --> 02:51:45,023
Yeah he has some thoughts about A Clockwork Orange

3345
02:51:46,047 --> 02:51:47,071
Did you know that was about Jews

3346
02:51:49,887 --> 02:51:50,911
You didn't do anything

3347
02:51:57,311 --> 02:52:00,383
No one no one cares about the ATL

3348
02:52:00,639 --> 02:52:01,407
They're played out

3349
02:52:01,919 --> 02:52:06,271
Jesus

3350
02:52:06,527 --> 02:52:07,551
No one knows the eight

3351
02:52:08,063 --> 02:52:09,599
No one cares they're played Outlook

3352
02:52:10,111 --> 02:52:13,439
People that had a problem look it up Clockwork Orange in the park

3353
02:52:13,695 --> 02:52:14,719
Where Jewish guy make

3354
02:52:14,975 --> 02:52:15,487
The guy kiss

3355
02:52:15,999 --> 02:52:16,511
Shoe when he says

3356
02:52:16,767 --> 02:52:17,535
Kiss the licks

3357
02:52:21,119 --> 02:52:24,191
What Jewish people favorite but what I'm saying is I love Jewish

3358
02:52:24,447 --> 02:52:28,287
People I loved you

3359
02:52:28,543 --> 02:52:29,311
Gander

3360
02:52:33,407 --> 02:52:33,919
Absolutely

3361
02:52:34,431 --> 02:52:35,711
Look at it explodes when it collapsed

3362
02:52:37,759 --> 02:52:43,647
Oh well nevermind I think I changed

3363
02:52:43,903 --> 02:52:46,719
Alex's response to this

3364
02:52:46,975 --> 02:52:47,999
Discussion is

3365
02:52:48,255 --> 02:52:51,839
I'll put up at background from the Doctor Strange

3366
02:52:52,095 --> 02:52:54,399
Wow

3367
02:52:54,911 --> 02:52:55,423
Just

3368
02:52:55,679 --> 02:52:58,495
Abdicating any responsibility to have a coherent conversation

3369
02:52:58,751 --> 02:53:03,359
I guess that there is a point of this words like how could you

3370
02:53:03,615 --> 02:53:04,895
I have a coherent conversation

3371
02:53:05,151 --> 02:53:05,919
But that's not

3372
02:53:06,175 --> 02:53:07,455
The position Alex has

3373
02:53:07,711 --> 02:53:09,503
Knock knock just like well let's get through it

3374
02:53:09,759 --> 02:53:10,271
No

3375
02:53:10,783 --> 02:53:11,551
Ethan Gage

3376
02:53:11,807 --> 02:53:13,855
Yes just choosing not to

3377
02:53:14,111 --> 02:53:14,879
I do any

3378
02:53:15,135 --> 02:53:15,903
Yeah it is

3379
02:53:16,159 --> 02:53:19,231
But at the same time he's still not actively

3380
02:53:19,487 --> 02:53:21,535
Helping it descend into complete chaos

3381
02:53:22,047 --> 02:53:23,071
You know I think he is

3382
02:53:23,839 --> 02:53:26,143
I think he's just kind of realize that he's a lot

3383
02:53:27,167 --> 02:53:33,311
Yeah I'm not ending it well that's a good point if you lose you can just end the game

3384
02:53:33,567 --> 02:53:39,455
You lost the game the game is over

3385
02:53:40,223 --> 02:53:43,551
Just Connie's not going to get more coherent right now

3386
02:53:43,807 --> 02:53:44,831
Booking like dirt

3387
02:53:45,087 --> 02:53:47,135
There is a built-in way to do this

3388
02:53:47,391 --> 02:53:49,951
Just cut the feed and then be like we couldn't

3389
02:53:50,207 --> 02:53:53,791
Before the band with too many people were watching at the same time site crash

3390
02:53:54,047 --> 02:54:00,191
Yep something like that you can easily do that then we can get out of this

3391
02:54:00,447 --> 02:54:01,215
Believe his ass

3392
02:54:01,471 --> 02:54:05,055
Especially not Alex's audience who he can convince of anything

3393
02:54:05,311 --> 02:54:07,103
So Alex

3394
02:54:08,383 --> 02:54:08,895
I guess

3395
02:54:09,151 --> 02:54:14,527
Out of the goodness of his heart decides that he's going to try and argue on behalf of Jewish people

3396
02:54:14,783 --> 02:54:16,319
Doesn't work could represent

3397
02:54:17,855 --> 02:54:18,623
Credible literature

3398
02:54:21,695 --> 02:54:25,279
So much great stuff

3399
02:54:25,791 --> 02:54:28,095
Hitler

3400
02:54:35,775 --> 02:54:36,799
Or Hugo Boss

3401
02:54:37,055 --> 02:54:39,359
Demonization

3402
02:54:40,127 --> 02:54:42,687
We don't care anymore ATL obviously

3403
02:54:42,943 --> 02:54:43,967
No one cares

3404
02:54:44,479 --> 02:54:46,015
Shut up no one cares Jesus

3405
02:54:46,271 --> 02:54:47,295
Shut up it's done

3406
02:54:48,063 --> 02:54:48,575
Tomorrow

3407
02:54:53,183 --> 02:54:54,719
Germans make really good cars

3408
02:54:55,487 --> 02:54:56,511
Why are we

3409
02:54:58,559 --> 02:55:00,095
Germicidal really cool leader

3410
02:55:00,351 --> 02:55:00,863
One time

3411
02:55:02,655 --> 02:55:03,935
Dear Alex

3412
02:55:05,727 --> 02:55:07,775
He is so just

3413
02:55:08,799 --> 02:55:14,943
Is treading water but like she's not good at writing water so he's kind of thinking

3414
02:55:15,199 --> 02:55:19,039
Everything he does only makes him go deeper in

3415
02:55:20,319 --> 02:55:22,367
So yeah is mad it's a Ben Shapiro

3416
02:55:22,623 --> 02:55:23,135
Well yeah

3417
02:55:23,391 --> 02:55:23,903
I mean

3418
02:55:24,159 --> 02:55:26,207
That's reasonable

3419
02:55:26,463 --> 02:55:26,975
No

3420
02:55:27,231 --> 02:55:29,023
No it's mostly cuz he's doing

3421
02:55:30,047 --> 02:55:31,583
I want to stay with Ben Shapiro

3422
02:55:32,095 --> 02:55:32,863
He was so

3423
02:55:33,119 --> 02:55:35,679
Disrespectful to his employee Candace Owens

3424
02:55:36,959 --> 02:55:37,727
Speaking out against

3425
02:55:37,983 --> 02:55:40,287
Me and that just showed you another level

3426
02:55:40,543 --> 02:55:42,079
Of this kind of control that's out there

3427
02:55:43,359 --> 02:55:44,383
I want and I want

3428
02:55:46,431 --> 02:55:47,455
Joy defended you

3429
02:55:51,551 --> 02:55:52,831
I think it's pretty obvious

3430
02:55:54,879 --> 02:55:55,647
B-boy

3431
02:55:59,231 --> 02:55:59,743
She deserved it

3432
02:56:02,559 --> 02:56:03,071
Yes but

3433
02:56:03,327 --> 02:56:03,839
Everyone

3434
02:56:04,095 --> 02:56:07,423
Play Still controlled by the Jewish media we need to serve Christ

3435
02:56:08,447 --> 02:56:10,495
Wow so is he

3436
02:56:10,751 --> 02:56:13,055
What is going on

3437
02:56:16,895 --> 02:56:17,407
How about it

3438
02:56:19,199 --> 02:56:20,479
I think they're controlling this Alex

3439
02:56:20,991 --> 02:56:24,831
Alex wants to push back a little bit on this idea of the Jewish media

3440
02:56:25,087 --> 02:56:26,367
Well that would be wise

3441
02:56:26,879 --> 02:56:27,647
Sure

3442
02:56:27,903 --> 02:56:34,047
He didn't do it all of the other time so that would have been wiser back then sure it wouldn't fly the number of times

3443
02:56:34,559 --> 02:56:37,375
Yay brings up and complains about the Jewish media

3444
02:56:37,631 --> 02:56:39,167
Decreases after every opportunity

3445
02:56:39,423 --> 02:56:43,007
So you tries and I think he does maybe the worst

3446
02:56:43,263 --> 02:56:44,543
The job possible

3447
02:56:45,055 --> 02:56:49,151
Text Alex

3448
02:56:55,807 --> 02:56:56,831
You never told me what to do

3449
02:56:57,343 --> 02:56:59,391
Emails herein are the writer's

3450
02:56:59,903 --> 02:57:03,231
I said hey yeah this is about the worst thing you could

3451
02:57:04,767 --> 02:57:05,279
Totally help

3452
02:57:09,375 --> 02:57:11,935
In public he flips the other side never talk to him again

3453
02:57:17,311 --> 02:57:17,823
Wait

3454
02:57:18,079 --> 02:57:19,871
Hollywood experience you had

3455
02:57:20,383 --> 02:57:22,431
Did you just tell my wife

3456
02:57:26,783 --> 02:57:27,295
Tired

3457
02:57:27,807 --> 02:57:28,319
Hearing about

3458
02:57:28,831 --> 02:57:29,343
The Jews like

3459
02:57:29,599 --> 02:57:30,879
I love him

3460
02:57:31,135 --> 02:57:31,647
The care

3461
02:57:31,903 --> 02:57:32,415
That much

3462
02:57:32,927 --> 02:57:35,487
You know

3463
02:57:35,743 --> 02:57:36,767
You make a good point

3464
02:57:41,375 --> 02:57:43,935
We're showing you guys the extent that you can go right

3465
02:57:44,447 --> 02:57:45,471
Everything

3466
02:57:45,727 --> 02:57:46,495
This point that you do

3467
02:57:46,751 --> 02:57:47,519
Proves my point

3468
02:57:47,775 --> 02:57:48,287
Watch this

3469
02:57:51,615 --> 02:57:52,127
And then

3470
02:57:52,639 --> 02:57:54,175
You cancel all of my deals

3471
02:57:54,431 --> 02:57:57,247
You proved exactly why I needed to go Defcon

3472
02:58:01,599 --> 02:58:06,975
Happy channel channel problem with what ya think

3473
02:58:07,231 --> 02:58:08,255
Alex Kidd argue

3474
02:58:08,511 --> 02:58:12,095
Alex believes that negative consequences is a

3475
02:58:12,351 --> 02:58:13,887
Are equivalent to virtue

3476
02:58:14,143 --> 02:58:17,727
The point he says that whenever he's being attacked it's because he's over the target

3477
02:58:17,983 --> 02:58:24,127
So if ye says there's a negative consequences that come from these anti-semitic things that I say

3478
02:58:24,383 --> 02:58:26,431
That proves that I'm right about those thing

3479
02:58:26,687 --> 02:58:27,199
Alex

3480
02:58:27,455 --> 02:58:27,967
That is a

3481
02:58:28,223 --> 02:58:32,575
Fundamental belief that Alex has about cause-and-effect you got it

3482
02:58:32,831 --> 02:58:37,951
This is bear territory for Alex Alex is not going to

3483
02:58:38,719 --> 02:58:39,743
You know I mean

3484
02:58:39,999 --> 02:58:40,511
And also

3485
02:58:41,023 --> 02:58:47,167
Come off that s*** about the I'm tired of people are just not going to win

3486
02:58:47,423 --> 02:58:49,471
In a conversation with a

3487
02:58:49,727 --> 02:58:50,239
Bipolar person

3488
02:58:50,751 --> 02:58:51,519
This is not going to happen

3489
02:58:51,775 --> 02:58:57,919
That's true that's why I avoid Hugh Everett

3490
02:58:58,431 --> 02:58:59,711
One trick to helping

3491
02:58:59,967 --> 02:59:04,831
People who are experiencing a manic episode going to be any books

3492
02:59:05,087 --> 02:59:06,623
You need to

3493
02:59:06,879 --> 02:59:11,487
Force them to eat as much food as they can possibly get and then

3494
02:59:11,743 --> 02:59:17,887
Get them as high as they can possibly get is going to it's going to work

3495
02:59:18,143 --> 02:59:23,263
A portal while if you just keep doing it and I'll that medications are going to sedate you

3496
02:59:23,775 --> 02:59:25,311
Don't try any other drugs

3497
02:59:26,335 --> 02:59:28,895
But the weed and the plaza food

3498
02:59:29,151 --> 02:59:30,175
It'll get you through a day

3499
02:59:30,687 --> 02:59:31,455
I find

3500
02:59:31,711 --> 02:59:33,503
I don't know if it's just sort of a

3501
02:59:34,527 --> 02:59:36,575
A function of your

3502
02:59:37,855 --> 02:59:42,207
Awareness or self work that you've done or whatever but

3503
02:59:42,463 --> 02:59:46,815
I find it with you just sort of calling things out is

3504
02:59:47,071 --> 02:59:48,095
Is helpful

3505
02:59:48,351 --> 02:59:54,239
You're aware of your own tendencies

3506
02:59:54,495 --> 02:59:56,799
I mean you haven't you've never seen me go

3507
02:59:57,055 --> 03:00:03,199
Full manic episode I've never seen you go death conflict and I would not name it that

3508
03:00:03,455 --> 03:00:04,991
How much happier

3509
03:00:05,247 --> 03:00:07,039
No less a tornado of

3510
03:00:07,295 --> 03:00:09,343
Will you will fall towards

3511
03:00:09,599 --> 03:00:12,671
Yeah yeah I don't look forward to that ever happened

3512
03:00:14,719 --> 03:00:20,863
This idea of the negative consequences being the same as virtue

3513
03:00:21,119 --> 03:00:22,911
Old is being used by yay

3514
03:00:23,167 --> 03:00:25,471
Anyway that I think is really Dave

3515
03:00:26,495 --> 03:00:28,543
If I save on an interview

3516
03:00:28,799 --> 03:00:29,311
And I say

3517
03:00:30,335 --> 03:00:30,847
I love her

3518
03:00:32,383 --> 03:00:33,663
And then they go and

3519
03:00:33,919 --> 03:00:35,199
5150 mean

3520
03:00:35,711 --> 03:00:36,991
Entrada lobotomized

3521
03:00:37,247 --> 03:00:38,271
Give me like we saw

3522
03:00:38,527 --> 03:00:39,295
Harley Pasternak

3523
03:00:39,807 --> 03:00:41,087
Or they put me in prison

3524
03:00:41,599 --> 03:00:43,135
It just proves what I'm saying

3525
03:00:43,903 --> 03:00:44,415
And it's going to

3526
03:00:44,671 --> 03:00:45,439
Spark the heist

3527
03:00:46,463 --> 03:00:47,999
It's going to spark the grammar schools going to

3528
03:00:48,255 --> 03:00:49,023
Spark the college

3529
03:00:50,047 --> 03:00:51,071
Enough is enough

3530
03:00:53,119 --> 03:00:53,631
How old is

3531
03:00:53,887 --> 03:00:54,399
Spectrum

3532
03:00:54,655 --> 03:00:55,167
Think I am

3533
03:00:56,959 --> 03:00:57,727
Speak out loud

3534
03:00:57,983 --> 03:00:58,751
That is our first

3535
03:00:59,263 --> 03:00:59,775
Amendment

3536
03:01:01,567 --> 03:01:02,079
That you have

3537
03:01:02,847 --> 03:01:04,895
Be considered to be on the Spectrum

3538
03:01:06,431 --> 03:01:07,455
To speak out loud

3539
03:01:07,967 --> 03:01:09,247
I do love my

3540
03:01:09,503 --> 03:01:10,527
Family

3541
03:01:15,135 --> 03:01:15,903
Chinese water

3542
03:01:16,159 --> 03:01:17,439
Torture

3543
03:01:18,719 --> 03:01:19,231
I would like

3544
03:01:19,999 --> 03:01:22,047
Long Malibu in front of my house and sing

3545
03:01:22,303 --> 03:01:27,167
How is it going

3546
03:01:31,007 --> 03:01:32,287
Nothing but he have to say about this

3547
03:01:35,359 --> 03:01:35,871
Who

3548
03:01:36,127 --> 03:01:39,199
So aside

3549
03:01:40,479 --> 03:01:46,623
The perspective that he's putting out is if I go out and I say this pro-hitler Andy's

3550
03:01:46,879 --> 03:01:48,671
Somatic drivel is nonsense

3551
03:01:49,183 --> 03:01:54,559
Alongside my auntie's medic buddy Nick Fuentes Brighton Milo and

3552
03:01:54,815 --> 03:01:55,327
Forest

3553
03:01:55,583 --> 03:01:57,375
Nazif

3554
03:01:57,631 --> 03:02:03,775
Put together this crew of Nazi losers and I said all this really horrible stuff

3555
03:02:04,031 --> 03:02:06,591
Consequences approved by argument was correct

3556
03:02:07,103 --> 03:02:08,639
And this will spark

3557
03:02:08,895 --> 03:02:11,711
Wave of anti-Semitism being proven

3558
03:02:11,967 --> 03:02:18,111
And taken in by the youth and I don't know how

3559
03:02:18,367 --> 03:02:19,135
Accurate that is

3560
03:02:19,647 --> 03:02:20,671
But it wouldn't

3561
03:02:20,927 --> 03:02:21,951
Ba0

3562
03:02:22,463 --> 03:02:22,975
Libra

3563
03:02:23,743 --> 03:02:27,327
It won't be a hundred percent of the high schoolers become a fisa Medicare

3564
03:02:27,583 --> 03:02:29,119
Also not 0%

3565
03:02:29,375 --> 03:02:32,703
What he's describing would be a phenomenon

3566
03:02:32,959 --> 03:02:33,471
Some

3567
03:02:33,727 --> 03:02:34,751
Soompi

3568
03:02:35,007 --> 03:02:35,519
Percentage

3569
03:02:35,775 --> 03:02:40,127
And that's f***** up because there are just natural consequences to behaving like this

3570
03:02:40,383 --> 03:02:43,967
That have nothing to do with proving that you're anti-semitic arguments were correct

3571
03:02:44,223 --> 03:02:44,991
No

3572
03:02:45,247 --> 03:02:48,319
But in Alex's conception of how the world works

3573
03:02:48,575 --> 03:02:52,415
He has no leg to stand on to be like that's nonsense man yeah

3574
03:02:52,671 --> 03:02:53,439
He kind of

3575
03:02:53,695 --> 03:02:59,071
Is forced to go along with it he he's argued himself into a place where his

3576
03:02:59,583 --> 03:03:01,375
Arguments are all pointing towards

3577
03:03:01,887 --> 03:03:02,399
Yeah

3578
03:03:02,911 --> 03:03:03,423
It's okay

3579
03:03:03,679 --> 03:03:07,263
Do whatever you want well to be fair though yeah it does not actually

3580
03:03:07,519 --> 03:03:09,567
Care that much about Hitler

3581
03:03:10,591 --> 03:03:11,103
But

3582
03:03:11,615 --> 03:03:12,639
Unfortunately

3583
03:03:13,407 --> 03:03:14,431
This clip is really bad

3584
03:03:15,199 --> 03:03:15,967
I don't really care that much

3585
03:03:16,223 --> 03:03:16,735
What about Hitler

3586
03:03:16,991 --> 03:03:17,503
I love them

3587
03:03:17,759 --> 03:03:19,039
Seems like

3588
03:03:20,063 --> 03:03:22,367
Seems like a cool guy you know it's like he

3589
03:03:23,647 --> 03:03:26,719
It's a really cool outfit and stuff and he was a really good architect

3590
03:03:31,071 --> 03:03:31,839
The look of it

3591
03:03:32,095 --> 03:03:33,887
Any didn't kill 6 million Jews that's it

3592
03:03:34,143 --> 03:03:39,007
Dislike factually incorrect

3593
03:03:39,519 --> 03:03:41,311
Why did Hitler did Target kills people

3594
03:03:41,567 --> 03:03:42,079
Bother you

3595
03:03:42,335 --> 03:03:43,615
I think

3596
03:03:44,127 --> 03:03:44,639
Palestinian

3597
03:03:50,271 --> 03:03:52,319
The first black president he was another Jewish

3598
03:03:52,831 --> 03:03:53,343
Po-boy

3599
03:03:53,599 --> 03:03:59,743
So we've got us some Holocaust denial Hitler was a cool dude and actually I don't care that much about

3600
03:03:59,999 --> 03:04:01,535
Hitler but also the Holocaust

3601
03:04:01,791 --> 03:04:02,303
Didn't happen

3602
03:04:02,559 --> 03:04:03,583
There is an issue there

3603
03:04:05,375 --> 03:04:09,471
I mean I think this is the headline at very least

3604
03:04:09,983 --> 03:04:11,775
If you're going to cover this stuff

3605
03:04:12,031 --> 03:04:13,567
In the way there

3606
03:04:13,823 --> 03:04:16,127
Has been on Twitter was like Kanye says

3607
03:04:16,383 --> 03:04:20,479
That he loves Hitler or whatever

3608
03:04:21,247 --> 03:04:25,087
Does deny the Holocaust very seriously he denies the holler

3609
03:04:25,343 --> 03:04:27,391
He does not believe the Holocaust happened

3610
03:04:27,903 --> 03:04:28,415
Therefore

3611
03:04:28,927 --> 03:04:31,743
He seems a bit more relevant

3612
03:04:31,999 --> 03:04:35,071
Then his admittedly there are

3613
03:04:35,327 --> 03:04:36,863
Elements of his

3614
03:04:37,119 --> 03:04:39,679
I love Hitler stuff that is f****** around

3615
03:04:39,935 --> 03:04:42,239
I believe that he means the things he's saying

3616
03:04:42,495 --> 03:04:45,567
But there is the the same

3617
03:04:45,823 --> 03:04:51,967
Dodge that so many of these people like Nick lentes do where it's like I'm joking

3618
03:04:52,223 --> 03:04:54,015
I'm joking around or like

3619
03:04:54,271 --> 03:05:00,415
I love Hitler but I love everybody a lot about how much I love Hitler

3620
03:05:00,671 --> 03:05:02,719
But I love everybody

3621
03:05:03,231 --> 03:05:08,095
And I think that that's a little bit more slippery in some ways than him just straight-up

3622
03:05:10,911 --> 03:05:11,935
Yeah yeah I think

3623
03:05:12,191 --> 03:05:14,239
I think we've all known somebody

3624
03:05:14,495 --> 03:05:15,519
In Our Lives who is

3625
03:05:15,775 --> 03:05:17,567
Who's had that like I'm an a******

3626
03:05:17,823 --> 03:05:21,663
Hitler was actually great kind of kind of day or whatever it is but

3627
03:05:21,919 --> 03:05:26,015
If you deny the Holocaust that is not a anything that's you have red

3628
03:05:26,271 --> 03:05:27,551
B******* and you think

3629
03:05:30,111 --> 03:05:31,391
Comes in

3630
03:05:31,647 --> 03:05:34,463
And he discusses how this is culture jamming

3631
03:05:34,719 --> 03:05:35,487
That's what they're doing

3632
03:05:35,999 --> 03:05:37,023
So like

3633
03:05:38,303 --> 03:05:39,071
He might not have been list

3634
03:05:39,327 --> 03:05:45,471
For that part or at least he's probably going to pretend he wasn't listening to that white lives matter shirt

3635
03:05:45,727 --> 03:05:46,239
Culture jamming

3636
03:05:46,495 --> 03:05:52,639
Because they took this thing that they're the left was doing in there like how how do you like it when we did a racist

3637
03:05:52,895 --> 03:05:56,735
Bride we proved why you made those shirts

3638
03:05:56,991 --> 03:05:57,503
Free Speech stuff

3639
03:05:58,271 --> 03:06:03,135
You talk about wearing white lives matter shirt and I'm really disappointed doing here today to its culture jamming

3640
03:06:03,391 --> 03:06:04,159
That's what we're doing

3641
03:06:04,671 --> 03:06:06,463
You can wear black lives matter shirt

3642
03:06:08,767 --> 03:06:10,815
We're ramming their own culture down their throat

3643
03:06:11,071 --> 03:06:12,607
And we're finding out that they don't like it

3644
03:06:12,863 --> 03:06:13,631
Same thing with this

3645
03:06:13,887 --> 03:06:14,911
Interview today

3646
03:06:15,167 --> 03:06:16,447
We believe in free speech

3647
03:06:16,703 --> 03:06:18,751
Whether or not

3648
03:06:19,007 --> 03:06:24,895
We believe in their right to say it in the internet number one story

3649
03:06:25,151 --> 03:06:26,431
In the world

3650
03:06:27,711 --> 03:06:28,735
Broadcast

3651
03:06:28,991 --> 03:06:29,503
Free speech

3652
03:06:29,759 --> 03:06:31,551
Breakpoint issue proud of yourself for

3653
03:06:31,807 --> 03:06:33,599
Getting a lot of attention for your b*******

3654
03:06:35,135 --> 03:06:35,647
Like

3655
03:06:36,159 --> 03:06:37,695
Two people at least

3656
03:06:37,951 --> 03:06:39,743
Involved in this don't believe in Priest

3657
03:06:41,791 --> 03:06:42,815
Ali wants

3658
03:06:43,071 --> 03:06:49,215
Blasphemy laws has been very public about how little he cares about free speech

3659
03:06:49,471 --> 03:06:51,263
By which he's able to push his agenda

3660
03:06:52,287 --> 03:06:58,431
You don't care about Free Speech maybe you think you do but you're sitting in a room with extremists who are used

3661
03:06:58,687 --> 03:06:59,199
Free speech

3662
03:07:00,735 --> 03:07:02,271
To create a Christian fashion

3663
03:07:02,527 --> 03:07:04,063
Just stay

3664
03:07:04,831 --> 03:07:05,855
That's not the same thing

3665
03:07:06,111 --> 03:07:06,623
No

3666
03:07:07,903 --> 03:07:08,415
Nope

3667
03:07:12,255 --> 03:07:18,399
And then you guys like that is what we are

3668
03:07:18,655 --> 03:07:21,983
Legitimately

3669
03:07:22,751 --> 03:07:23,775
I love nothing

3670
03:07:25,567 --> 03:07:27,359
I think he's having fun

3671
03:07:27,615 --> 03:07:31,711
Poking all the time

3672
03:07:31,967 --> 03:07:32,991
I think he enjoys a destroy

3673
03:07:33,759 --> 03:07:35,039
I would say I don't

3674
03:07:35,295 --> 03:07:35,807
I don't think this

3675
03:07:36,063 --> 03:07:36,831
Story here

3676
03:07:37,343 --> 03:07:40,927
With ye should be about anti-Semitism or Nazis or any of that

3677
03:07:41,439 --> 03:07:43,487
To me the human interest story

3678
03:07:45,279 --> 03:07:50,143
Think about what you can do with your platform right now cuz they want to make that the issue

3679
03:07:50,399 --> 03:07:51,679
Most people say

3680
03:07:54,239 --> 03:08:00,127
Your audience

3681
03:08:00,383 --> 03:08:03,711
You know what they mean they means what

3682
03:08:03,967 --> 03:08:09,343
Conjuring it's a ride

3683
03:08:09,599 --> 03:08:11,135
Play Kanye don't you think it's them

3684
03:08:11,391 --> 03:08:17,535
Owen just doesn't get it man he has no conception of what he's a part of here and a clip like

3685
03:08:17,791 --> 03:08:18,303
Illustrate

3686
03:08:18,559 --> 03:08:24,703
He wants to cover his ass and reframe his interview in a way that not Nazis can see as acceptable and yeah

3687
03:08:24,959 --> 03:08:25,727
Wants no part of that

3688
03:08:26,239 --> 03:08:30,591
He doesn't want to be sanitized he doesn't want plausible deniability he's doing what he's doing

3689
03:08:30,847 --> 03:08:33,407
People that go in Alexandra's props to make that happen

3690
03:08:33,919 --> 03:08:34,431
Nickit

3691
03:08:34,943 --> 03:08:40,319
Even seems to know the score but Alex and Owen the people whose platform this is are the marks

3692
03:08:40,831 --> 03:08:43,135
They want the message gays pushing to be push

3693
03:08:43,391 --> 03:08:45,695
They also just don't want their entire facade

3694
03:08:45,951 --> 03:08:46,463
To be punctured

3695
03:08:46,719 --> 03:08:50,303
So they have to do this performative sanitization and fake push back because

3696
03:08:50,559 --> 03:08:53,887
That's work without her every other time that had to deal with bigoted grift

3697
03:08:54,143 --> 03:08:56,703
They can remind them subtly to protect

3698
03:08:56,959 --> 03:08:57,727
The business

3699
03:08:57,983 --> 03:08:58,495
But not today

3700
03:08:59,263 --> 03:09:00,799
Also Pro tip for the next

3701
03:09:01,055 --> 03:09:03,871
Right-wing s******* who decides to interview gay in the future

3702
03:09:04,127 --> 03:09:10,271
Don't use the words they arouse him really what do you think is going to happen you're going to get

3703
03:09:10,527 --> 03:09:11,551
Call Dad

3704
03:09:11,807 --> 03:09:17,951
You're an idiot you just agree with him he wins if you're dumb forever

3705
03:09:19,231 --> 03:09:19,743
The

3706
03:09:23,327 --> 03:09:24,095
Of intelligence

3707
03:09:26,399 --> 03:09:27,423
Cuz it makes

3708
03:09:27,679 --> 03:09:29,983
Nick Fuentes look like a f****** genius

3709
03:09:30,239 --> 03:09:31,263
And he isn't

3710
03:09:31,519 --> 03:09:32,031
Idiot

3711
03:09:32,543 --> 03:09:35,871
I struggle I struggle with exactly how to do

3712
03:09:36,127 --> 03:09:38,175
Describe him I don't think he's an idiot

3713
03:09:38,431 --> 03:09:39,199
But

3714
03:09:40,223 --> 03:09:42,527
He's definitely he's far more savvy

3715
03:09:42,783 --> 03:09:44,831
Any of these ding dongs

3716
03:09:45,343 --> 03:09:47,135
Anyway speaking to take dogs

3717
03:09:47,647 --> 03:09:48,159
Tim pool

3718
03:09:49,695 --> 03:09:51,743
Took a risk

3719
03:09:53,023 --> 03:09:56,863
Didn't work out

3720
03:09:57,119 --> 03:09:59,935
You know what you going to do certainly probably got a lot of viewers

3721
03:10:00,191 --> 03:10:01,983
Definitely didn't look like an idiot

3722
03:10:03,263 --> 03:10:05,823
And also hear congratulations

3723
03:10:06,079 --> 03:10:06,591
Missed him

3724
03:10:06,847 --> 03:10:09,151
Here

3725
03:10:09,663 --> 03:10:10,687
Houston 3 hours 3 minutes

3726
03:10:10,943 --> 03:10:11,455
By the way

3727
03:10:16,831 --> 03:10:18,879
Does Temple got the call from those boys

3728
03:10:19,135 --> 03:10:20,159
10 minutes before I got there

3729
03:10:20,671 --> 03:10:21,439
I said flag this

3730
03:10:21,695 --> 03:10:22,207
Aflac.

3731
03:10:22,463 --> 03:10:25,023
Also Temple is the MTC you know

3732
03:10:25,279 --> 03:10:28,351
And your real real human being so no one's ever heard of

3733
03:10:28,607 --> 03:10:31,679
Temple you're the legend that is Alex Jones

3734
03:10:32,191 --> 03:10:32,959
And you were fighting on

3735
03:10:33,215 --> 03:10:34,239
On the front line and I were here we

3736
03:10:34,495 --> 03:10:36,031
What you got some other Superheroes part of the

3737
03:10:36,287 --> 03:10:37,055
The avenger movie fighting

3738
03:10:37,311 --> 03:10:37,823
Christ

3739
03:10:38,079 --> 03:10:38,591
And Free Speech

3740
03:10:39,871 --> 03:10:40,383
Stem

3741
03:10:41,151 --> 03:10:41,663
He did good

3742
03:10:41,919 --> 03:10:43,967
That's it's fun it's fun

3743
03:10:44,223 --> 03:10:45,503
For them because I bet

3744
03:10:45,759 --> 03:10:47,295
That hurt temples feelings

3745
03:10:47,807 --> 03:10:52,159
And I would love for you to say that nobody's ever heard of us that be f****** fantastic

3746
03:10:52,415 --> 03:10:58,303
Field day with that you just thinking the idea that Gary would ever have thought of you

3747
03:10:58,559 --> 03:11:02,655
Is bizarre Valeri in the same way that like hearing

3748
03:11:02,911 --> 03:11:04,191
Norm

3749
03:11:04,447 --> 03:11:08,543
Say that they couldn't get someone to be the corporate representative because of us

3750
03:11:08,799 --> 03:11:12,639
That is bizarre and surreal

3751
03:11:12,895 --> 03:11:14,687
Thought the name Jordan Hall

3752
03:11:14,943 --> 03:11:16,991
Yeah is Unthinkable but like

3753
03:11:17,759 --> 03:11:18,527
Tim pool

3754
03:11:19,551 --> 03:11:21,087
Like this is going to sting

3755
03:11:21,599 --> 03:11:22,879
That's really got to hurt

3756
03:11:23,391 --> 03:11:23,903
Yep

3757
03:11:24,927 --> 03:11:25,695
That's gotta hurt

3758
03:11:26,207 --> 03:11:30,303
That's got to hurt so bad and PC and no one's ever heard of you

3759
03:11:30,815 --> 03:11:32,607
Man

3760
03:11:33,119 --> 03:11:34,911
The guy who came up with net

3761
03:11:35,167 --> 03:11:38,495
And Yahoo are you who is pretty good

3762
03:11:38,751 --> 03:11:39,263
He

3763
03:11:39,519 --> 03:11:40,287
Devastated you

3764
03:11:40,543 --> 03:11:44,127
That's sad

3765
03:11:44,383 --> 03:11:50,527
Nothing you who is broken

3766
03:11:50,783 --> 03:11:52,063
I think we should respect on that for

3767
03:11:52,319 --> 03:11:53,087
I don't

3768
03:11:53,343 --> 03:11:55,903
Fair enough

3769
03:11:56,159 --> 03:11:58,975
And that is that no black people should ever criticized Hitman

3770
03:12:11,007 --> 03:12:12,287
Now he's going to come back and

3771
03:12:12,543 --> 03:12:13,055
Sellout

3772
03:12:13,567 --> 03:12:16,127
Yeah he's sold out a little bit because

3773
03:12:17,919 --> 03:12:18,943
Because he

3774
03:12:19,711 --> 03:12:20,223
The king

3775
03:12:20,735 --> 03:12:26,367
Yeah I'm saying he denounced me I'm the one fighting on the front line and no black person to say nothing bad about me

3776
03:12:28,415 --> 03:12:30,719
. I put my life on the line

3777
03:12:32,511 --> 03:12:36,607
Talk about anything happens to me every the greatest

3778
03:12:36,863 --> 03:12:37,887
Shut up

3779
03:12:39,167 --> 03:12:40,959
Go home to your

3780
03:12:41,215 --> 03:12:42,495
Scared little bins

3781
03:12:42,751 --> 03:12:43,519
And you scare a little

3782
03:12:43,775 --> 03:12:46,335
Townhome you stay little movie contract

3783
03:12:48,127 --> 03:12:48,895
Nothing

3784
03:12:49,407 --> 03:12:51,455
There's some of these moments of hostility

3785
03:12:51,711 --> 03:12:52,735
Come out

3786
03:12:52,991 --> 03:12:54,015
George Bush

3787
03:12:54,271 --> 03:12:55,551
Doesn't care about black

3788
03:12:56,063 --> 03:13:02,207
And I am f****** here for it I did see a tweet that was really funny was like George.

3789
03:13:02,463 --> 03:13:08,607
People should come out and take honey

3790
03:13:08,863 --> 03:13:15,007
Mike Fiers

3791
03:13:15,263 --> 03:13:18,847
Trevor's woodworking on.snl we finally giving you your first good bit

Tweet that was I don't want to rip somebody off a really funny thought

03:13:30,623 --> 03:13:32,671
I don't even know how to respond to this other than

3795
03:13:33,439 --> 03:13:34,975
Alex has something

3796
03:13:35,231 --> 03:13:35,999
Going to say that is just

3797
03:13:36,255 --> 03:13:36,767
Ridiculous

3798
03:13:40,351 --> 03:13:42,143
Fashion having a bag of funny bring that up

3799
03:13:43,935 --> 03:13:44,959
Future

3800

Is not trying to

3801
03:13:47,519 --> 03:13:48,543
Building our own

3802
03:13:49,055 --> 03:13:50,847
There would you like to bank with the coworkers

3834
03:15:45,023 --> 03:15:46,047
He's not a good dude

3835
03:15:47,327 --> 03:15:48,095
Shouldn't be hard

Not all that not only that I think it's probably worse than you think

3840
03:15:56,799 --> 03:15:59,103
In fact you and I might disagree on how worse.

3841
03:15:59,359 --> 03:16:00,383
Historical villain

3842
03:16:00,639 --> 03:16:01,919
Bad dude

3843
03:16:02,431 --> 03:16:03,711

03:16:03,967 --> 03:16:04,991
Besides

3845
03:16:05,503 --> 03:16:08,063

I like anal I do not

3854
03:16:27,775 --> 03:16:28,543
The Holocaust

3855
03:16:29,311 --> 03:16:30,079
Is not what happened

3856
03:16:30,591 --> 03:16:31,103
The factor that

3857
03:16:31,359 --> 03:16:32,383
And Hitler has a lot of

3858
03:16:32,639 --> 03:16:34,431
Redeeming qualities

3859
03:16:34,687 --> 03:16:36,735
Wheelies

3860
03:16:39,807 --> 03:16:40,319
God says

3861
03:16:40,831 --> 03:16:41,599
Man should not

3862
03:16:41,855 --> 03:16:42,879
Kill we should not have

3863
03:16:43,391 --> 03:16:43,903
Pause.

3864
03:16:44,159 --> 03:16:44,671
Okay

3865
03:16:44,927 --> 03:16:46,975
So you're trapped didn't work there either

3866
03:16:47,231 --> 03:16:48,511
You have

3867
03:16:48,767 --> 03:16:50,815
Allowed to this gentleman

3868
03:16:51,327 --> 03:16:54,399
Say horrific things and now deny the Holocaust Weiss

3869
03:16:55,679 --> 03:16:56,959
Three more times in a good as hell

3870
03:16:59,519 --> 03:17:00,543
Is like

3871
03:17:00,799 --> 03:17:03,615
Hey man I got to tell you that the Holocaust happen

3872
03:17:04,127 --> 03:17:05,407
I mean listen

3873
03:17:05,919 --> 03:17:06,431
I'll tell you this

3874
03:17:06,687 --> 03:17:08,223
I have not done

3875
03:17:08,735 --> 03:17:09,759
That much research

3876
03:17:10,015 --> 03:17:15,903
Research into World War I'm not yet 40 I mean old white men past the age of 40 eventually have a World War

3877
03:17:16,159 --> 03:17:21,535
I got a couple years but yeah I didn't need a lot of research

3878
03:17:22,047 --> 03:17:22,815
I can tell you

3879
03:17:23,071 --> 03:17:24,607
Confidently with

3880
03:17:24,863 --> 03:17:25,887
100% certainty

3881
03:17:26,143 --> 03:17:27,167
It was a bad dude

3882
03:17:27,423 --> 03:17:29,471
Taylor's bad dude hit by the bad news but Alex

3883
03:17:29,727 --> 03:17:30,239
I do think

3884
03:17:30,495 --> 03:17:32,799
Did this is one thing I will say

3885
03:17:33,055 --> 03:17:33,567
2

3886
03:17:34,335 --> 03:17:35,359
It's not to his credit but

3887
03:17:35,615 --> 03:17:36,127
It is like

3888
03:17:36,383 --> 03:17:37,151
This is pushing back

3889
03:17:37,919 --> 03:17:39,455
I think he does realized

3890
03:17:39,711 --> 03:17:40,223
But like

3891
03:17:40,479 --> 03:17:44,831
I maybe didn't catch it the first time but now that he's denied the Holocaust again

3892
03:17:45,087 --> 03:17:46,111
I do have to make

3893
03:17:46,623 --> 03:17:49,695
Very clear that I believe the Holocaust happened

3894
03:17:49,951 --> 03:17:50,463
Jones hat

3895
03:17:50,719 --> 03:17:51,999
Has to be like the Holocaust

3896
03:17:52,255 --> 03:17:53,023
Did that happen

3897
03:17:53,279 --> 03:17:56,095
There is a line apparently and here is where it is

3898
03:17:58,143 --> 03:17:58,655
I love

3899
03:17:59,423 --> 03:17:59,935
Accordingly

3900
03:18:00,959 --> 03:18:01,727
All the way from the

3901
03:18:01,983 --> 03:18:03,263
Balenciaga's

3902
03:18:03,775 --> 03:18:04,799
To the Hitler's

3903
03:18:07,103 --> 03:18:08,383
The Ari Emanuel

3904
03:18:08,895 --> 03:18:10,943
Did Jamie dimon to the people

3905
03:18:12,479 --> 03:18:13,503
Amber Alert is what I'm saying

3906
03:18:14,015 --> 03:18:14,783
Why grandfather

3907
03:18:17,599 --> 03:18:20,671
Run over stuff

3908
03:18:25,535 --> 03:18:27,327
8 years old Amber Alert

3909
03:18:27,583 --> 03:18:28,607
Ex-girlfriend Amber was doing

3910
03:18:28,863 --> 03:18:29,375
Something in the streets

3911
03:18:41,407 --> 03:18:42,175
And there were piles of

3912
03:18:42,431 --> 03:18:43,199
The dead bodies 100

3913
03:18:43,711 --> 03:18:44,479
Call Blackburn

3914
03:18:47,295 --> 03:18:47,807
Is that

3915
03:18:48,319 --> 03:18:49,855
Just because you hate the globalist

3916
03:18:50,879 --> 03:18:51,903
Call Schwab

3917
03:18:53,439 --> 03:18:55,487
ATL

3918
03:18:56,255 --> 03:18:56,767
Yeah but not

3919
03:18:58,559 --> 03:19:00,095
This is just it's not going to work

3920
03:19:00,351 --> 03:19:02,655
Whatever you're doing is not going to work but I

3921
03:19:02,911 --> 03:19:04,703
I do I do appreciate Alex

3922
03:19:04,959 --> 03:19:05,471
At least

3923
03:19:06,751 --> 03:19:08,031
Being like the Holocaust did happen

3924
03:19:08,287 --> 03:19:08,799
The Holocaust

3925
03:19:09,823 --> 03:19:10,591
The Holocaust happen

3926
03:19:11,359 --> 03:19:11,871
And it was

3927
03:19:12,383 --> 03:19:13,663
And I'm going to throw this out there

3928
03:19:14,175 --> 03:19:17,503
I don't care what God you believe in it is okay to hate the Nazi

3929
03:19:17,759 --> 03:19:21,343
In fact I would say it's maybe the moral imperative

3930
03:19:21,599 --> 03:19:22,623
Whatever group

3931
03:19:22,879 --> 03:19:24,671
You are mad at or hate

3932
03:19:24,927 --> 03:19:25,695
Does not

3933
03:19:26,207 --> 03:19:27,999
Justify you denying the Holocaust

3934
03:19:28,255 --> 03:19:29,535
Nope

3935
03:19:29,791 --> 03:19:30,303
Stalex is there

3936
03:19:30,815 --> 03:19:31,583
Animals

3937
03:19:31,839 --> 03:19:36,447
Maybe on some level that is a strategic calculation on his part because he's like

3938
03:19:36,959 --> 03:19:37,471
I will be

3939
03:19:37,727 --> 03:19:38,495
Straight up

3940
03:19:38,751 --> 03:19:39,263
Yeah

3941
03:19:39,519 --> 03:19:41,055
There's there's one thing that I

3942
03:19:41,311 --> 03:19:42,335
Have to do

3943
03:19:42,591 --> 03:19:43,359
And that is

3944
03:19:43,615 --> 03:19:44,639
Remember that

3945
03:19:44,895 --> 03:19:48,735
The US was the good guy in WWII that's all I got to do

3946
03:19:48,991 --> 03:19:53,087
Franklin my brand won't survive if I put up with helicopter

3947
03:19:53,343 --> 03:19:56,671
Set lights too many old conservatives who are still like

3948
03:19:56,927 --> 03:19:57,439
Listen

3949
03:19:57,951 --> 03:20:01,535
WWII is legitimately the only thing we can hang our hat on us

3950
03:20:01,791 --> 03:20:03,327
How old

3951
03:20:03,583 --> 03:20:05,119
Those types were in Alex's audience

3952
03:20:05,631 --> 03:20:09,983
That they are the people who buy his dumpster

3953
03:20:10,239 --> 03:20:11,007
So Alec

3954
03:20:11,519 --> 03:20:13,823
Is he's trying to

3955
03:20:14,079 --> 03:20:14,591
Be like

3956
03:20:15,615 --> 03:20:17,407
Look at you being at G and all this stuff

3957
03:20:17,919 --> 03:20:18,431
And

3958
03:20:18,687 --> 03:20:19,199
Ali

3959
03:20:19,455 --> 03:20:19,967
Comes in

3960
03:20:20,223 --> 03:20:21,503
And shuts Alex.

3961
03:20:21,759 --> 03:20:23,807
Fuckdown

3962
03:20:24,063 --> 03:20:26,623
Alex is just completely dejected and like

3963
03:20:28,415 --> 03:20:28,927
I got nothing

3964
03:20:33,535 --> 03:20:34,047
He say he hated

3965
03:20:34,559 --> 03:20:37,119
Didn't say you hated anybody why isn't anybody listening to

3966
03:20:37,887 --> 03:20:41,215
We are man

3967
03:20:48,383 --> 03:20:49,407

Well I mean

3979
03:21:26,527 --> 03:21:27,295
That's not

3980
03:21:27,551 --> 03:21:28,319
Really what

3981
03:21:28,575 --> 03:21:29,343
Gays doing but

3982
03:21:29,855 --> 03:21:31,903
If Alex believes that's what he's doing

3983
03:21:32,159 --> 03:21:34,207
If that is the kind of

3984
03:21:34,975 --> 03:21:37,279
Last Refuge that Alex has to try

3985
03:21:37,535 --> 03:21:38,559
Contextualize this

3986
03:21:38,815 --> 03:21:40,607
Interview in a way that like

3987
03:21:41,119 --> 03:21:42,143
How to build a people

3988
03:21:42,399 --> 03:21:43,423
Allie has just

3989
03:21:44,447 --> 03:21:44,959
I just been like

3990
03:21:45,471 --> 03:21:45,983
Boom

3991
03:21:46,495 --> 03:21:47,263
Door slam

3992
03:21:47,775 --> 03:21:48,799
And let's not forget

3993
03:21:49,311 --> 03:21:51,103
Nick Fuentes

3994
03:21:51,359 --> 03:21:52,639
Originally he said

3995
03:21:52,895 --> 03:21:58,271
I agree with ye and then his head went back underneath the table in front in slap so

3996
03:21:58,527 --> 03:22:04,671
Alright alright I feel enough of that I'm sorry I'm sick of this s***

3997
03:22:04,927 --> 03:22:11,071
Kanye off enough of that alright

3998
03:22:13,631 --> 03:22:14,399
Yay

3999
03:22:15,423 --> 03:22:16,703
Once again complains about the Jewish

4000
03:22:16,959 --> 03:22:18,239
Media because

4001
03:22:18,495 --> 03:22:19,519
Alex was trying to

4002
03:22:19,775 --> 03:22:20,287
Sort of

4003
03:22:20,799 --> 03:22:21,311
Coast

4004
03:22:21,567 --> 03:22:22,079
2

4005
03:22:22,335 --> 03:22:26,687
Closing statement really want to leave things on is that

4006
03:22:26,943 --> 03:22:27,967
Gay wants to

4007
03:22:28,223 --> 03:22:31,551
Whakaari Emmanuel's wife

4008
03:22:32,063 --> 03:22:32,831
God the judge

4009
03:22:34,367 --> 03:22:36,671
And we got to change ourselves to somebody else

4010
03:22:37,439 --> 03:22:37,951
Exactly

4011
03:22:38,207 --> 03:22:39,487
I meant to say hey

4012
03:22:40,255 --> 03:22:41,023
Show you how much

4013
03:22:42,047 --> 03:22:43,327
Jewish media can't tell me what

4014
03:22:46,911 --> 03:22:48,191
We could get a nice private room

4015
03:22:48,703 --> 03:22:49,471
Me and your wife

4016
03:22:49,727 --> 03:22:52,799
Can go in and work on the clozeline I'm really good at it and

4017
03:22:58,943 --> 03:22:59,455
Absolutely

4018
03:22:59,711 --> 03:23:00,223
Peanut

4019
03:23:00,479 --> 03:23:01,247
Sounds like you do

4020
03:23:01,503 --> 03:23:02,015
His wife

4021
03:23:05,599 --> 03:23:06,111
Create event

4022
03:23:08,927 --> 03:23:10,719
Infowars.com tomorrow

4023
03:23:10,975 --> 03:23:15,071
Tomorrow's news today is apparently our emanuel's wife's clothing line isn't up to

4024
03:23:15,327 --> 03:23:16,607
Not that good

4025
03:23:16,863 --> 03:23:17,375
Now that guy

4026
03:23:18,399 --> 03:23:20,959
I do I do appreciate that Alex has at least

4027
03:23:21,215 --> 03:23:25,823
Observant enough to notice that he keeps talking about

4028
03:23:26,335 --> 03:23:27,871
Getting kind of weird there man

4029
03:23:28,127 --> 03:23:28,639
Yeah it is you

4030
03:23:30,175 --> 03:23:33,247
Relationship with women

4031
03:23:33,759 --> 03:23:34,783
I'm shocked

4032
03:23:35,039 --> 03:23:41,183
Alex didn't pick up on the p*** dude

4033
03:23:41,439 --> 03:23:42,463
Is transparent

4034
03:23:42,975 --> 03:23:44,767
So as ye leave

4035
03:23:46,047 --> 03:23:46,815
Alex does not

4036
03:23:47,071 --> 03:23:48,095
Seem incredibly happy

4037
03:23:53,471 --> 03:23:53,983
First Amendment

4038
03:23:54,751 --> 03:23:56,031
I love you. Taking the mask off

4039
03:23:58,591 --> 03:23:59,359
Wilbert Johnson

4040
03:23:59,871 --> 03:24:01,151
What's the impersonator Wilbur

4041
03:24:01,919 --> 03:24:02,431
Net-net

4042
03:24:02,687 --> 03:24:03,199
Was here though

4043
03:24:03,455 --> 03:24:04,991
Yahoo play

4044
03:24:08,319 --> 03:24:08,831
What you want

4045
03:24:09,087 --> 03:24:09,599
Hey Ya

4046
03:24:11,135 --> 03:24:11,903
Broke

4047
03:24:12,159 --> 03:24:12,671
Finally broke

4048
03:24:15,999 --> 03:24:17,279
Do the last time

4049
03:24:19,071 --> 03:24:19,583
Incredible

4050
03:24:25,983 --> 03:24:28,799
Play Justin Trudeau

4051
03:24:29,055 --> 03:24:30,079
Has been incredible

4052
03:24:30,335 --> 03:24:31,103
Incredibles wedding

4053
03:24:31,871 --> 03:24:34,175
Leaves

4054
03:24:34,431 --> 03:24:39,039
They're still the fourth hour a bit of the fourth hour and then the War Room

4055
03:24:39,295 --> 03:24:39,807
And

4056
03:24:40,319 --> 03:24:45,951
Alex says they're going to take 3 hours a calls there's going to get everybody's opinion on this

4057
03:24:46,207 --> 03:24:48,255
This interview they're going to get down to it

4058
03:24:48,511 --> 03:24:49,791
Talk about free speech

4059
03:24:50,303 --> 03:24:53,631
Alex spends the rest of his show

4060
03:24:54,399 --> 03:24:55,679
Just certain navel-gazing

4061
03:24:55,935 --> 03:24:59,775
About how many viewers they have

4062
03:25:00,031 --> 03:25:04,127
To tell their friends about the shows I got we have 25 million people watching

4063
03:25:04,383 --> 03:25:05,919
If all of you told your friend

4064
03:25:06,175 --> 03:25:09,759
Think about day we could make a real chain

4065
03:25:10,015 --> 03:25:10,527
Call Sonia Shah

4066
03:25:11,039 --> 03:25:13,599
Hey man so he's there hosting the war room with Owen

4067
03:25:13,855 --> 03:25:14,367
At the beginning

4068
03:25:14,879 --> 03:25:15,903
And

4069
03:25:17,183 --> 03:25:17,695
It's just

4070
03:25:17,951 --> 03:25:20,255
A desperate attempt to rewrite What hap

4071
03:25:21,023 --> 03:25:21,535
And

4072
03:25:22,559 --> 03:25:26,911
It makes sense that he would spend the rest of his show like navel-gazing because that's the only way he has

4073
03:25:27,167 --> 03:25:28,959
How to get back some of his bride

4074
03:25:29,215 --> 03:25:31,263
It's been so ripped away from him that

4075
03:25:31,519 --> 03:25:32,287
Now he's like

4076
03:25:32,543 --> 03:25:35,103
Balming himself I think it was all worth it

4077
03:25:35,615 --> 03:25:36,127
Because of all these views

4078
03:25:38,431 --> 03:25:38,943
He's

4079
03:25:39,199 --> 03:25:41,247
Play just a couple clips

4080
03:25:41,759 --> 03:25:43,807
Like now that ya is gone

4081
03:25:44,319 --> 03:25:46,111
He is able to

4082
03:25:46,367 --> 03:25:47,135
Rewrite what

4083
03:25:47,391 --> 03:25:48,159
He said with

4084
03:25:48,415 --> 03:25:49,183
About ye saying

4085
03:25:49,439 --> 03:25:49,951
No

4086
03:25:50,207 --> 03:25:51,743
I like not sit

4087
03:25:56,351 --> 03:25:57,375
Shock value

4088
03:25:58,399 --> 03:26:00,191
Designer style of Stalin I love Mouse

4089
03:26:00,447 --> 03:26:01,215
Mall

4090
03:26:03,007 --> 03:26:05,055
It's all over the place

4091
03:26:09,663 --> 03:26:10,175
Is this

4092
03:26:10,943 --> 03:26:12,223
Infowars.com

4093
03:26:13,503 --> 03:26:15,295
Tomorrow's problem

4094
03:26:16,575 --> 03:26:17,343
What's happening

4095
03:26:19,391 --> 03:26:21,695
677 million people so far

4096
03:26:34,239 --> 03:26:35,007
30/45

4097
03:26:37,567 --> 03:26:38,591
Just last couple hours

4098
03:26:41,407 --> 03:26:41,919
That cost

4099
03:26:42,431 --> 03:26:43,711
Serious

4100
03:26:44,735 --> 03:26:46,015
Sooner that gets to an ad pivot

4101
03:26:46,527 --> 03:26:48,575
And here is another attempt

4102
03:26:48,831 --> 03:26:50,879
223 contextualize

4103
03:26:51,135 --> 03:26:51,903
What year was saying

4104
03:26:52,671 --> 03:26:54,719
But you know what you did do today Alex

4105
03:26:55,487 --> 03:26:56,511
Was you let yay

4106
03:26:57,279 --> 03:26:58,047
You had the most success

4107
03:26:58,303 --> 03:26:58,815
Successful

4108
03:26:59,327 --> 03:26:59,839
Podcast lives

4109
03:27:00,095 --> 03:27:00,863
Stream with ye-es

4110
03:27:01,119 --> 03:27:01,631
The guest

4111
03:27:02,399 --> 03:27:05,727
He didn't like any of the other interviews he did he walked out of some of them obviously like

4112
03:27:05,983 --> 03:27:06,751
You mentioned with Tim pool

4113
03:27:07,519 --> 03:27:08,031
And so

4114
03:27:08,287 --> 03:27:09,055
I think again

4115
03:27:09,311 --> 03:27:09,823
Today

4116
03:27:10,079 --> 03:27:11,615
You are the champion of free speech

4117
03:27:11,871 --> 03:27:13,151
You put your neck out there with

4118
03:27:13,407 --> 03:27:13,919
With knowing the red

4119
03:27:14,175 --> 03:27:14,687
Knowing

4120
03:27:14,943 --> 03:27:15,455
Probably going to be

4121
03:27:15,967 --> 03:27:16,479
And you did

4122
03:27:16,735 --> 03:27:19,295
And you did and I got the most views on a livestream ever on The Intern

4123
03:27:19,807 --> 03:27:20,319
In the most

4124
03:27:20,575 --> 03:27:21,855
Band studio in the world

4125
03:27:24,927 --> 03:27:25,951
The real story

4126
03:27:26,207 --> 03:27:26,975
Take away that free speech

4127
03:27:27,487 --> 03:27:28,511
It might be under

4128
03:27:28,767 --> 03:27:29,279
Serious attack

4129
03:27:30,047 --> 03:27:30,559
What is not dead

4130
03:27:31,071 --> 03:27:34,655
Still want it they still want to hear controversy

4131
03:27:37,983 --> 03:27:39,263
Wasn't doing I was doing

4132
03:27:39,519 --> 03:27:40,031
Shop value

4133
03:27:42,847 --> 03:27:44,383
He's not the Holocaust man

4134
03:27:44,639 --> 03:27:48,991
He denied the Holocaust multiple times and he specifically said this is not

4135
03:27:49,247 --> 03:27:50,783
For shock value

4136
03:27:51,039 --> 03:27:51,551
Trolling

4137
03:27:51,807 --> 03:27:52,319
Any of this

4138
03:27:53,087 --> 03:27:53,599
Alex

4139
03:27:54,111 --> 03:27:54,623
When

4140
03:27:54,879 --> 03:27:55,391
Nike Pride

4141
03:27:55,647 --> 03:27:59,231
Do use these excuses for what ye was saying while ye was there

4142
03:27:59,487 --> 03:27:59,999
He said no

4143
03:28:00,511 --> 03:28:02,047
And he said not only that

4144
03:28:02,303 --> 03:28:02,815
I love Hitler

4145
03:28:03,071 --> 03:28:03,839
Nazis are great

4146
03:28:04,095 --> 03:28:05,375
Holocaust didn't happen

4147
03:28:06,911 --> 03:28:08,191
Now that he's gone

4148
03:28:08,447 --> 03:28:09,215
Alex can do this

4149
03:28:09,471 --> 03:28:11,007
It's the same thing with Tim pool

4150
03:28:11,263 --> 03:28:14,335
Tim would not stand up and assert his

4151
03:28:14,591 --> 03:28:15,615
Position or say

4152
03:28:15,871 --> 03:28:18,175
Hey I don't think this is cool until

4153
03:28:18,431 --> 03:28:19,711
The minute ye left

4154
03:28:20,479 --> 03:28:20,991
This is Aldi

4155
03:28:21,247 --> 03:28:21,759
Really

4156
03:28:22,015 --> 03:28:23,551
Pathetic attempts at savings

4157
03:28:23,807 --> 03:28:24,831
Face

4158
03:28:25,087 --> 03:28:25,599
Bring something

4159
03:28:25,855 --> 03:28:28,159
Rewriting the narrative in a way that works

4160
03:28:28,415 --> 03:28:29,695
For you because this person didn't

4161
03:28:29,951 --> 03:28:30,463
Play along

4162
03:28:30,719 --> 03:28:31,743
With the way that you were going

4163
03:28:31,999 --> 03:28:33,535
As to what Owen saying

4164
03:28:33,791 --> 03:28:35,071
Like oh can graduation

4165
03:28:35,327 --> 03:28:38,911
3 hours with an anti-semite when Tim pool only lasted

4166
03:28:39,167 --> 03:28:41,215
20 minutes that is not the compliment you think it is

4167
03:28:41,471 --> 03:28:44,799
I was I listen to that and I was like he does not understand

4168
03:28:45,055 --> 03:28:46,847
Embed essentially what he just said is

4169
03:28:47,615 --> 03:28:49,151
It is worth it to us

4170
03:28:49,407 --> 03:28:49,919
Too broad

4171
03:28:50,175 --> 03:28:50,687
Cast

4172
03:28:51,199 --> 03:28:52,735
Holocaust denial and Hate

4173
03:28:53,759 --> 03:28:54,271
Cuz

4174
03:28:54,783 --> 03:28:55,807
We got money

4175
03:28:56,063 --> 03:28:57,087
Yeah score

4176
03:28:57,343 --> 03:28:58,111
Hypothetical

4177
03:28:58,367 --> 03:29:04,511
Exactly we don't even know if we got it yet

4178
03:29:04,767 --> 03:29:07,583
More to have this interview than we make from this interview

4179
03:29:08,607 --> 03:29:11,423
I was listening to the war room and I noticed

4180
03:29:11,679 --> 03:29:13,215
This on the Infowars

4181
03:29:13,471 --> 03:29:15,263
Feed

4182
03:29:15,519 --> 03:29:17,055
The feed

4183
03:29:17,311 --> 03:29:20,639
Video that they posted of the War Room has weird

4184
03:29:24,223 --> 03:29:24,991
Blackheath

4185
03:29:25,247 --> 03:29:25,759
Incredible music

4186
03:29:27,807 --> 03:29:28,831
You can hear that music

4187
03:29:29,855 --> 03:29:31,391
Breaking from Hollywood

4188
03:29:31,903 --> 03:29:33,439
Breaking from the mainstream

4189
03:29:33,695 --> 03:29:34,975
Definitely something cutout

4190
03:29:35,743 --> 03:29:38,303
And so I was thinking like what's going to be something really f******

4191
03:29:38,559 --> 03:29:42,655
Incentive if all the other things are still out of

4192
03:29:42,911 --> 03:29:44,959
If anything is cut out of this interview

4193
03:29:45,983 --> 03:29:46,495
F******

4194
03:29:46,751 --> 03:29:47,775
Well here's the thing

4195
03:29:48,287 --> 03:29:49,823
I found the actual bra

4196
03:29:50,847 --> 03:29:51,871
Video is that

4197
03:29:52,639 --> 03:29:55,455
And it's really just them talkin about China

4198
03:29:55,711 --> 03:29:57,247
Now they want China to be free

4199
03:29:58,015 --> 03:29:59,807
It's not offensive at all it's about 6 minutes

4200
03:30:00,063 --> 03:30:00,575
Of

4201
03:30:01,343 --> 03:30:02,623
Extraneous conversation

4202
03:30:03,135 --> 03:30:05,695
About to Liberty for the Chinese people

4203
03:30:06,463 --> 03:30:07,487
But then there's this

4204
03:30:07,999 --> 03:30:09,023
I think it might have been why was

4205
03:30:24,383 --> 03:30:24,895
When you got

4206
03:30:25,407 --> 03:30:25,919
4015

4207
03:30:26,943 --> 03:30:27,455
Videos

4208
03:30:27,967 --> 03:30:28,479
The bills are in the

4209
03:30:28,991 --> 03:30:29,503
$2,000

4210
03:30:31,295 --> 03:30:32,063
And so

4211
03:30:32,575 --> 03:30:33,087
We've been told

4212
03:30:38,207 --> 03:30:39,231
Infowars

4213
03:30:39,743 --> 03:30:40,511
Dot-com

4214
03:30:42,303 --> 03:30:44,095
Doesn't come back

4215
03:30:44,351 --> 03:30:46,655
Wow he was going to take calls for hours

4216
03:30:46,911 --> 03:30:48,191
And it's just Owen

4217
03:30:48,447 --> 03:30:52,031
It's boring as hell I don't care interviews Jesse Lee Peterson

4218
03:30:54,335 --> 03:30:54,847
I think

4219
03:30:55,359 --> 03:30:55,871
That

4220
03:30:56,639 --> 03:31:02,015
Maybe they cut that out because it looks really weak and you don't want that in the

4221
03:31:02,271 --> 03:31:03,807
The final product

4222
03:31:04,319 --> 03:31:04,831
End

4223
03:31:05,087 --> 03:31:06,623
The next morning Alex declare Bank

4224
03:31:07,647 --> 03:31:13,791
So maybe that is more real than it usually appears sales pitches

4225
03:31:14,047 --> 03:31:15,839
Like no they straight up

4226
03:31:16,351 --> 03:31:17,119
Okay got hit

4227
03:31:17,375 --> 03:31:19,167
Like with the Sirius expenses because

4228
03:31:19,423 --> 03:31:19,935
The

4229
03:31:20,191 --> 03:31:22,495
Increased bandwidth cost

4230
03:31:22,751 --> 03:31:25,055
And if there is some silver lining

4231
03:31:25,311 --> 03:31:26,079
To this

4232
03:31:26,335 --> 03:31:26,847
Possibly

4233
03:31:27,359 --> 03:31:30,175
It may be that indirectly or directly

4234
03:31:30,687 --> 03:31:31,199
Platforming

4235
03:31:31,455 --> 03:31:31,967
Beignets

4236
03:31:32,223 --> 03:31:32,991
Bulshit

4237
03:31:33,247 --> 03:31:36,831
Anti-Semitism in Holocaust denial could have bankrupt Alex

4238
03:31:37,855 --> 03:31:39,391
What do his bankruptcy

4239
03:31:39,647 --> 03:31:40,671
Yeah yeah

4240
03:31:41,183 --> 03:31:41,695
I mean it's

4241
03:31:41,951 --> 03:31:42,719
It is funny

4242
03:31:42,975 --> 03:31:43,999
That

4243
03:31:45,023 --> 03:31:46,815
Hey you got bankrupted because

4244
03:31:47,071 --> 03:31:47,583
Yay

4245
03:31:47,839 --> 03:31:49,375
Did something that he

4246
03:31:49,631 --> 03:31:50,655
Previously decried

4247
03:31:51,167 --> 03:31:51,935
Which is breaking

4248
03:31:52,191 --> 03:31:52,703
The internet

4249
03:31:53,471 --> 03:31:55,775
Here's that he's wasted upon his own petard

4250
03:31:56,287 --> 03:31:58,591
There's a little bit of irony irony abound

4251
03:31:58,847 --> 03:32:00,383
Things in this whole f****** thing

4252
03:32:00,895 --> 03:32:01,407
So

4253
03:32:02,431 --> 03:32:04,991
Particularly care about Owens rambling

4254
03:32:05,247 --> 03:32:06,015
Nonsense

4255
03:32:06,271 --> 03:32:08,063
Defenses of what has happened on

4256
03:32:08,319 --> 03:32:09,855
We're not going to

4257
03:32:10,111 --> 03:32:11,391
Spend more time diving

4258
03:32:11,647 --> 03:32:12,159
Into that

4259
03:32:14,719 --> 03:32:18,815
Words almost fail you know when when trying to look at what

4260
03:32:19,071 --> 03:32:19,583
What is happy

4261
03:32:20,095 --> 03:32:20,607
Yeah

4262
03:32:20,863 --> 03:32:21,631
There's a lot of missing

4263
03:32:21,887 --> 03:32:22,911
The forest for the trees

4264
03:32:23,167 --> 03:32:23,935
In terms of

4265
03:32:24,191 --> 03:32:29,055
Just boiling the sound to Yale of Hitler or likes Nazis

4266
03:32:29,567 --> 03:32:30,847
Because I mean that certainly is a

4267
03:32:31,359 --> 03:32:33,407
But there's so much more going on

4268
03:32:33,919 --> 03:32:34,687
They all

4269
03:32:35,199 --> 03:32:35,711
Funnels

4270
03:32:35,967 --> 03:32:36,735
Into that

4271
03:32:37,247 --> 03:32:37,759
Yeah you know it

4272
03:32:38,015 --> 03:32:39,551
It's not like there are a ton of

4273
03:32:39,807 --> 03:32:40,575
Different things

4274
03:32:41,599 --> 03:32:42,111
Better happen

4275
03:32:42,623 --> 03:32:44,671
They're a bunch of different things that are all

4276
03:32:45,183 --> 03:32:46,207
Routed back

4277
03:32:46,463 --> 03:32:48,511
To this anti-semitic ideology

4278
03:32:48,767 --> 03:32:49,535
LG

4279
03:32:49,791 --> 03:32:52,863
The clear influences of the people like Milo Nick

4280
03:32:53,375 --> 03:32:55,167
Owen Benjamin Ali

4281
03:32:55,423 --> 03:32:56,191
Bitter around him

4282
03:32:56,447 --> 03:32:58,751
These these

4283
03:32:59,263 --> 03:33:02,079
Obsession with pornography and evils of it

4284
03:33:03,359 --> 03:33:04,383
Very clearly

4285
03:33:04,639 --> 03:33:05,407
He is just a

4286
03:33:05,663 --> 03:33:07,711
Side Road of his anti-semitic ideas

4287
03:33:08,223 --> 03:33:09,503
This is

4288
03:33:11,039 --> 03:33:11,551
It's troubling

4289
03:33:11,807 --> 03:33:12,319
I mean

4290
03:33:13,343 --> 03:33:15,647
I was in the shower earlier I was thinking

4291
03:33:16,415 --> 03:33:17,183
Weeping

4292
03:33:17,695 --> 03:33:19,231
Why did I choose to do this

4293
03:33:19,743 --> 03:33:20,511
Why is Jordan my

4294
03:33:20,767 --> 03:33:21,535
My friend Oliver

4295
03:33:22,559 --> 03:33:23,071
No

4296
03:33:23,327 --> 03:33:24,607
I mean look

4297
03:33:24,863 --> 03:33:29,471
Puppet sleep-deprived some of those thoughts may come later

4298
03:33:29,983 --> 03:33:33,055
I had a feeling of like this is the worst

4299
03:33:33,311 --> 03:33:34,591
First episode of Infowars I've ever

4300
03:33:35,615 --> 03:33:38,687
And I don't know if I can confidently say that

4301
03:33:38,943 --> 03:33:39,455
Because he said

4302
03:33:39,711 --> 03:33:41,759
There's been a lot of really bad episode

4303
03:33:42,271 --> 03:33:45,855
A graphic one sticks out to me and I don't know how much of that was just because it was

4304
03:33:46,367 --> 03:33:47,903
Piano traumatic for me to

4305
03:33:48,159 --> 03:33:49,439
Cover that episode in

4306
03:33:49,951 --> 03:33:51,999
Yeah the research into it was really horrible

4307
03:33:52,255 --> 03:33:53,279
But in terms of life

4308
03:33:54,303 --> 03:33:55,839
A presentation of something

4309
03:33:56,351 --> 03:33:59,679
No he's had Richard Spencer on he said David Duke

4310
03:33:59,935 --> 03:34:00,703
Those were

4311
03:34:01,215 --> 03:34:03,263
Really as bad as this

4312
03:34:03,519 --> 03:34:04,031
In terms of

4313
03:34:04,799 --> 03:34:05,311
Incompetent

4314
03:34:05,567 --> 03:34:06,079
Of

4315
03:34:06,335 --> 03:34:06,847
The pushback

4316
03:34:09,151 --> 03:34:11,455
Intentional or otherwise ineffective

4317
03:34:12,479 --> 03:34:12,991
The

4318
03:34:13,759 --> 03:34:14,271
The Dane

4319
03:34:14,527 --> 03:34:15,039
Danger of

4320
03:34:15,295 --> 03:34:16,831
It in terms of

4321
03:34:19,135 --> 03:34:20,159
I feel like it's

4322
03:34:20,415 --> 03:34:21,695
It's worse than David Duke

4323
03:34:22,207 --> 03:34:22,975
Inasmuch as like

4324
03:34:23,231 --> 03:34:23,743
David Dukes

4325
03:34:23,999 --> 03:34:24,511
Cool

4326
03:34:25,279 --> 03:34:26,047
Don't like

4327
03:34:26,303 --> 03:34:26,815
Sure

4328
03:34:27,071 --> 03:34:28,607
You know there is a

4329
03:34:29,375 --> 03:34:35,519
Unwise NSF debating David Duke when you're definitely not ready to and you don't really disagree with someone all that much

4330
03:34:35,775 --> 03:34:36,287
Seems dumb

4331
03:34:36,543 --> 03:34:37,823
And maybe not the best idea

4332
03:34:39,103 --> 03:34:39,871
Yay is

4333
03:34:40,127 --> 03:34:40,639
Cool

4334
03:34:40,895 --> 03:34:41,407
Still

4335
03:34:41,663 --> 03:34:42,431
To a lot of people

4336
03:34:43,967 --> 03:34:46,015
And also he has something that

4337
03:34:46,271 --> 03:34:47,295
David Duke doesn't have

4338
03:34:47,807 --> 03:34:48,831
Which is people like

4339
03:34:49,343 --> 03:34:49,855
Nick Fuentes

4340
03:34:50,111 --> 03:34:50,623
Sand

4341
03:34:50,879 --> 03:34:51,391
Boeing Badge

4342
03:34:51,647 --> 03:34:52,159
How many Milo

4343
03:34:53,951 --> 03:34:55,231
And I think that presents

4344
03:34:55,999 --> 03:34:58,559
A unique set of circumstances that

4345
03:35:00,095 --> 03:35:00,607
I don't know

4346
03:35:00,863 --> 03:35:02,655
I mean you can I need to

4347
03:35:02,911 --> 03:35:03,935
Sleep on it

4348
03:35:04,191 --> 03:35:05,983
Yeah and reflect

4349
03:35:06,239 --> 03:35:10,079
But this is up there as one of the worst episodes of his show that I've heard

4350
03:35:11,615 --> 03:35:15,967
I mean it's very rare that you actually get someone denying the Holocaust on in for

4351
03:35:16,223 --> 03:35:17,247
That is something that is

4352
03:35:17,503 --> 03:35:21,087
Is it puts it in a category I mean

4353
03:35:22,367 --> 03:35:23,647
My my thought

4354
03:35:24,159 --> 03:35:25,951
As I come to the end of this

4355
03:35:27,231 --> 03:35:27,743
Horrific

4356
03:35:27,999 --> 03:35:28,511
Whatever

4357
03:35:29,535 --> 03:35:30,047
Is that

4358
03:35:30,303 --> 03:35:31,583
I met you you slept

4359
03:35:31,839 --> 03:35:34,655
Exactly I'm riding

4360
03:35:35,167 --> 03:35:36,447
Yeah I mean

4361
03:35:38,239 --> 03:35:39,007
The Anders Breivik

4362
03:35:39,519 --> 03:35:40,287
Is far more

4363
03:35:40,543 --> 03:35:41,055
Disgust

4364
03:35:41,311 --> 03:35:41,823
Sing to me

4365
03:35:42,335 --> 03:35:43,615
Then this because

4366
03:35:43,871 --> 03:35:44,639
This is a

4367
03:35:44,895 --> 03:35:46,431
Funhouse mirror version

4368
03:35:47,199 --> 03:35:48,223
Of reality

4369
03:35:50,015 --> 03:35:50,527
It's it's

4370
03:35:50,783 --> 03:35:51,295
Good knockers

4371
03:35:51,551 --> 03:35:52,063
I mean

4372
03:35:52,831 --> 03:35:54,111
The Anders Breivik s***

4373
03:35:54,367 --> 03:35:55,391
Is so f*****

4374
03:35:56,159 --> 03:35:57,951
And the way that he dealt with that

4375
03:35:58,207 --> 03:35:59,231
Well I mean yes

4376
03:35:59,743 --> 03:36:01,279
We're also talking about the f******

4377
03:36:02,047 --> 03:36:04,095
You know he's denying the holiday

4378
03:36:04,351 --> 03:36:07,935
And I like that the Holocaust

4379
03:36:08,191 --> 03:36:10,239
Did murder a bunch of people

4380
03:36:10,495 --> 03:36:11,007
I meant

4381
03:36:11,519 --> 03:36:12,543
I mean not to say

4382
03:36:13,055 --> 03:36:14,079
That these issues

4383
03:36:14,335 --> 03:36:16,383
Violence doesn't still

4384
03:36:16,639 --> 03:36:17,663
Continue to this day

4385
03:36:17,919 --> 03:36:20,991
Kanye personally or ye personally

4386
03:36:22,015 --> 03:36:23,295
It doesn't have that

4387
03:36:24,063 --> 03:36:25,599
Malika Sanders brevik wasn't on the

4388
03:36:25,855 --> 03:36:26,623
The show

4389
03:36:26,879 --> 03:36:27,391
So maybe it is

4390
03:36:27,647 --> 03:36:29,183
Maybe you've made your point is Briella the

4391
03:36:29,439 --> 03:36:30,463
But I'm not sure

4392
03:36:30,719 --> 03:36:31,743
Tumi

4393
03:36:32,511 --> 03:36:35,071
Here's the number of my

4394
03:36:35,583 --> 03:36:36,607
Cuz we can argue

4395
03:36:37,119 --> 03:36:41,983
What the worst days are the definition of the worst you know that

4396
03:36:42,495 --> 03:36:43,775
My problem with this

4397
03:36:44,031 --> 03:36:44,543
What is that

4398
03:36:45,823 --> 03:36:46,591
One way

4399
03:36:47,103 --> 03:36:47,615
That

4400
03:36:48,639 --> 03:36:50,687
Almost everybody is going to engage with

4401
03:36:51,711 --> 03:36:52,991
He's the most

4402
03:36:53,503 --> 03:36:54,783
Damaging way to engage with

4403
03:36:55,551 --> 03:36:56,063
Tumi

4404
03:36:56,319 --> 03:36:59,135
The only possible way you can engage with this

4405
03:36:59,391 --> 03:36:59,903
Exactly

4406
03:37:00,415 --> 03:37:01,183
Is if you watch the

4407
03:37:01,439 --> 03:37:02,207
The entire video

4408
03:37:02,463 --> 03:37:03,999
Or if you listen to our show

4409
03:37:05,023 --> 03:37:05,791
Because this

4410
03:37:06,047 --> 03:37:06,815
What is a totality

4411
03:37:07,071 --> 03:37:08,351
Any any

4412
03:37:08,863 --> 03:37:09,887
Any attempt

4413
03:37:10,143 --> 03:37:10,911
To shrink it down

4414
03:37:11,167 --> 03:37:11,679
Is

4415
03:37:11,935 --> 03:37:14,495
Damaging more harmful than his dinner

4416
03:37:15,007 --> 03:37:16,287
Clips

4417
03:37:16,543 --> 03:37:17,823
Do a disservice

4418
03:37:21,663 --> 03:37:24,223
The totality of what this is this conversation

4419
03:37:24,735 --> 03:37:27,295
The way it goes I I agree I agree with you

4420
03:37:27,551 --> 03:37:28,063
And I think

4421
03:37:28,319 --> 03:37:30,111
Also to double down on that

4422
03:37:30,879 --> 03:37:32,415
Getting lost in the weeds of

4423
03:37:32,671 --> 03:37:33,183
The

4424
03:37:34,207 --> 03:37:35,999
Do you see reality and

4425
03:37:36,255 --> 03:37:36,767
Clear

4426
03:37:37,023 --> 03:37:38,815
Observe the clown ashness of It

4427
03:37:39,071 --> 03:37:41,375
With the the Netanyahu stops

4428
03:37:41,631 --> 03:37:44,447
And all that getting lost in that

4429
03:37:44,703 --> 03:37:46,239
Such an absurdity who would ever take

4430
03:37:46,495 --> 03:37:47,263
Seriously

4431
03:37:47,519 --> 03:37:48,031
Is

4432
03:37:48,543 --> 03:37:50,591
Working towards the interest of

4433
03:37:50,847 --> 03:37:53,151
The the propaganda is meant

4434
03:37:53,663 --> 03:37:54,175
For howitzer

4435
03:37:54,431 --> 03:37:54,943
Meant to be

4436
03:37:55,199 --> 03:37:58,271
Be dismissed by people who would take it

4437
03:37:58,527 --> 03:37:59,039
Get seriously other way

4438
03:37:59,295 --> 03:38:01,599
And every one of the people in this

4439
03:38:02,111 --> 03:38:03,135
In this interview

4440
03:38:03,903 --> 03:38:09,279
A date you're not going to get enough contacts about them through whatever it is that you're reading

4441
03:38:09,535 --> 03:38:10,815
Whatever tweets you're getting

4442
03:38:11,327 --> 03:38:11,839
Any of it

4443
03:38:12,095 --> 03:38:16,191
Even if you read everything that all the newspapers and blogs and all that s***

4444
03:38:16,447 --> 03:38:17,215
And all the tweets

4445
03:38:17,471 --> 03:38:19,775
You do not know enough about Nick Fuentes

4446
03:38:20,031 --> 03:38:22,847
You do not know enough about alley Alexander you did not have

4447
03:38:23,103 --> 03:38:24,127
The context necessary

4448
03:38:24,383 --> 03:38:25,407
To understand what

4449
03:38:25,663 --> 03:38:26,431
Is going on

4450
03:38:26,943 --> 03:38:29,759
And you definitely don't have any idea how to engage with

4451
03:38:30,015 --> 03:38:31,295
What day is doing right now

4452
03:38:31,551 --> 03:38:34,111
Everyone will be done a disservice

4453
03:38:34,623 --> 03:38:36,671
Because of all of the people that are not

4454
03:38:37,183 --> 03:38:38,719
Naked Kanye or Alex

4455
03:38:39,487 --> 03:38:40,255
Yeah probably

4456
03:38:40,767 --> 03:38:42,047
And it sucks

4457
03:38:42,303 --> 03:38:44,095
My f****** sucks

4458
03:38:45,119 --> 03:38:45,887
Lot of things

4459
03:38:46,143 --> 03:38:47,423
A lot of things were

4460
03:38:47,935 --> 03:38:48,447
Or Taken

4461
03:38:48,703 --> 03:38:49,471
On this episode

4462
03:38:50,495 --> 03:38:51,519
My my sleep

4463
03:38:51,775 --> 03:38:53,311
Was deprived from me

4464
03:38:53,823 --> 03:38:59,711
The audience was deprived another deposition episode that was going to be laughing about that again resale good to haggai great

4465
03:38:59,967 --> 03:39:00,735
Everybody out there

I bet you wish you didn't have so much f****** yet you in your life now don't you

4467
03:39:05,343 --> 03:39:08,159
I could use a little less help

4468
03:39:08,415 --> 03:39:08,927
Never again

4469
03:39:10,463 --> 03:39:12,767
