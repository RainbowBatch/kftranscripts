Show on Spotify

14
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,968
Colors and stuff it's a lot of fun it's a I've enjoyed it I like that

15
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:02,368
And it reminded me

16
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,648
I feel like

17
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,184
At certain points

18
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:11,840
We should try and abused our notoriety in some way of celebrities

19
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,376
Whatever

20
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:19,776
Power of the audience need to put this out there into the universe to manifest

21
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:23,360
Would love to end up beating up Doughboy absolutely

22
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,640
Get it done

23
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:31,040
I feel like their elbows everything that's happened to us over the last like couple years has

24
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:37,440
It's been like this absurd like it's never going to happen

25
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,464
These things do end up happen

26
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,864
Where the times

27
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,448
The problem is in order to achieve those things

28
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:54,848
You have always had an unreachable goal in front of you yeah and that is being on the Doughboys oh no

29
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:07,648
What you get man it's dangerous

30
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:13,024
Quincy hunt Mitch down

31
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,328
It's a dumb dumb show

32
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:20,960
My bright spot is I don't know if you can see these right here my man

33
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:27,360
I saw these are some new socks with my pops on them

34
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:33,760
Annie and Jake and then I got this new hoodie and the reason is because my wife is amazing

35
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:40,160
He got me these things she is amazing she loves Christmas know you could put dogs on sale

36
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:46,560
Well yeah you couldn't brand-new technology Paxico it didn't exist

37
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:52,960
Early Christmas present

38
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:57,312
Hiding Christmas presents until the moment they arrive

39
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,848
And then giving them to me

40
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:05,248
To make me happy on way good 19 days early

41
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,016
Never been hidden

42
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:06,784
Not once

43
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,184
But it's fantastic

44
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,208
Great socks

45
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:20,607
Always like a nice novelty socks love them I didn't use to I'm not I'm not a things guy

46
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,631
But now

47
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:28,031
It's novelty socks all the way

48
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:34,431
Jordan today

49
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:37,247
Do do do

50
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,551
Our last episode was a lot

51
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:45,951
Requiring us taking a little bit of a in a little paws for Monday

52
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:52,351
You want to jump right back into all that necessarily

53
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,119
Give that a little bit

54
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,447
Breathing Room give it a little bit of time to to sit

55
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:02,847
And then Friday unfortunately going to have to come back to you some other swamp Non-Stop

56
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,383
But for today

57
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,783
We have ourselves a little deposition to go over to say that it is time to

58
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:17,183
Release the Kraken

59
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:22,559
He's an interesting cat I really got a different feel for him based on this that I had before

60
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:28,447
You have this image of him is kind of a pro wrestler he's a kind of ESA

61
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,495
White and Northeast accent

62
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:34,079
They think a lot of people code as dumb

63
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,151
Certainly unfair prejudicial and what have you but

64
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,455
He also has

65
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:44,575
Like a bombastic Nest to him and you know he yells at the press conferences chair

66
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:50,975
And you don't really get much of a chance to ever hear like thoughts or or like sort of his personality

67
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,511
Be expressed

68
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,071
I found it really interesting to see

69
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:00,447
Six to eight hours of Hemet episode

70
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,983
Oh my God

71
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:08,383
So I mean obviously he's not a wrestler anymore because he is he is

72
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
Still okay

73
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:16,575
How do you keep kayfabe in a deposition

74
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,391
Little bit off more than some

75
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:25,791
Yeah he talks about how he has a bunch like scars on his head and stuff off chair shots and what-have-you

76
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:32,959
You know what that that's something interesting to the keep track of get is a little bit of protecting the business

77
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:39,103
The Big Show at a deposition is is a different stormy Paul White

78
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,271
Oh wait to see the mayor of something now know that can

79
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:51,391
Is the demons favorite Patriot.

80
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,439
Actually I think

81
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:59,839
That there is maybe more of a sticking to his guns then a lot of other people know that kayfabe

82
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,863
Baby is actually

83
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,911
I'm sitting with it

84
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:09,311
And we'll see what happens

85
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:14,943

Game saliva soaked balaclava wrestling beside Owens puddles of Tears boiling beside a fake campfire

Risen above

97
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,223
Miami star

98
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,759
Go take a little break you down

99
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,343
A list for me

100
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,927
And then we're going to come back

101
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:35,839
And I'm going to start the show over

102
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,119
F*** you

103
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,959
I got plenty work for you but at the end of the day

104
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,007
F*** you and your new world order

105
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,055
And f*** the horse you rode in on

106
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,335
And all your s***

107
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,871
Maybe today

108
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,199
Maybe I'll just be gone a month maybe 5 years

109
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,015
Belle walk out of here tomorrow

110
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,551
And you never see me again

111
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,855
That's really what I want to do

112
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,159
I never want to come back here again

113
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,743
I apologize to the crew in the listener's yesterday that I

114
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:07,071
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

115
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,607
I'll be better tomorrow

116
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:13,471
He's not so no it will talk about that on Friday of course but for now Alex

117
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,775
Getting a little play in this deposition

118
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:19,871
Good call so that's that's kind of fun we just get to hear about the Kraken

119
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,151
And his business

120
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:25,759
But there's not a contacts drop but I think sums up some of this stuff pretty well

121
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,295
And so the only basis

122
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,063
Just for your knowledge

123
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,343
Was

124
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
Your common sense

125
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,903
And the TV shows you watch

126
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,255
If there's anything else Tony

127
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,327
No I think we've done with

128
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,983
All right. I like that idea and the only thing you had to

129
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:52,383
Back it up with common sense and TV shows

130
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:58,783
To do everything I have to give you is a simple way of describing his death

131
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:05,183
Deposition begins like all the depositions swear in the witness

132
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,975
Go down the same way

133
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:13,375
All of the other ones too if you're saying that the swear in the witness

134
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,399
Part has eclipse

135
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,727
This is going to be interesting yes you go

136
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,775
Reporter police swear in the witness

137
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,103
Mr. pedantic

138
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:29,503
Follower of Jesus Christ on 610 BS Bi-Lo Bi-Lo

139
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,319
As instructed to us in the Book of Matthew

140
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,367
Okay

141
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,903
Alright money

142
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:38,975
You're free

143
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,511
Take a note

144
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,815
Absolutely

145
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,583
I bet the

146
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,863
Testimony that you're going to

147
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,631
Beginning

148
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,679
Absolutely

149
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,983
And so you can either swear and if you

150
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,079
Waterfront

151
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:58,687
Diaphragm is OBS in my noveno my way to be truthful

152
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,455
This is

153
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:05,855
This is interesting to me because like all of them you know they have religious inclination and what

154
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:12,255
And I think the only person I've heard he was like I don't swear something

155
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:18,655
It's My Religion 222 swear Oaths is there a new type of sovereign citizen that believes they already

156
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:25,055
Eddie live in heaven like that kind of like a Heavenly citizen like something along those lines

157
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:31,455
BMV

158
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:37,855
What is a sovereign citizen of the citizen of Heaven I wonder what button to use

159
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,391
Imaginary friend

160
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,951
Will judge him

161
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,767
He's got to get a good lawyer

162
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:49,375
No but Norm is here

163
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,911
Here's an observer

164
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,727
Not representing badonde

165
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:57,055
There's another I don't think he may not have a lawyer

166
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:03,455
Cuz I think they're just people observing and like making objections and hookup on behalf of like Infowars

167
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,063
I think so

168
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,623
And then in terms like free speech systems

169
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:17,535
There's a guy who is like the lawyer one of Mark Randazzo is associate

170
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,839
Voice you'll hear objecting

171
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,423
I think I think he was representing Free Speech system

172
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,471
Maybe partially but don't be

173
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,007
It's not really that important

174
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,663
In terms of coming to Infowars coming to down this path but I'm be withdrawn to a

175
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,431
Alex Russo

176
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
Great reasons

177
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,247
Totally good reason guy

178
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,783
Would it be fair to say that

179
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,575
As part of your

180
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,927
You are views as a

181
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,207
Independent cost

182
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,767
A

183
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,327
High-level distrust

184
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,095
4

185
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,399
Is that fair

186
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,703
The main street meat on both sides absolutely

187
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,823
Right and left on both of them lie to their teeth and we have the ability and stuff

188
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,383
And credit to Alex Jones Infowars.com

189
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,967
We have the ability is to see through the lies and

190
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,783
Constellations for the public what really is going on

191
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,807
And all that

192
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,087
Why were the

193
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:16,927
We're all the most hated networks in the mainstream

194
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:21,791
And I know that's what people love that's why we got millions of followers and everything else because people want

195
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:25,375
True that sun and most the time it it's hot it sucks

196
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
It stinks

197
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,983
But yeah we can't sugarcoat things we need to tell people the exact truth though

198
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,287
The way things are and that's the way I mean

199
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:37,919
I'm not speaking for Alex Jones or anything I'm speak to myself that's way I conduct journalism if I see something wrong

200
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:42,783
I'm going out to Democrats and Republicans I confronted Obama confronted

201
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,975
? what is your name

202
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:57,119
Congressman that shot into Mantua and Michael Bloomberg many other people like them

203
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,679
I'm not a potty I don't I'm not a potty bias

204
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,703
Speaking to me

205
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,543
I'm going to come after them playing simple politically you know

206
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,847
And I do my best to ask questions and

207
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,919
Phantom they don't you know whatever it is

208
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,503
Is it

209
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,527
Alex Jones

210
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,319
Your

211
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:17,855
View that

212
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,391
He was telling the truth

213
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,159
Where

214
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,183
The

215
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
Other mainstream

216
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,975
Media Outlets

217
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
Would not

218
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,047
Absolutely

219
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,607
He was just asking questions

220
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,631
And they don't like me

221
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,655
I don't like it

222
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,447
I don't like it

223
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:39,359
Yeah you might have hit a little bit of an important Point unless that is that he does not end

224
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,383
Consensus

225
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,783
Hey dude talks

226
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:53,183
To say one of the reasons this is so f****** long these depositions is he keeps answering questions that weren't asked

227
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:56,255
On and on and on

228
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,023
Meddys

229
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,815
Maddie's beautiful

230
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:05,215
Okay and ask this again

231
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:11,615
I do I do appreciate that because I do think that there is some sincerity and badonde is part of

232
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:16,223
He thinks that like this is hard and it sucks getting old is R-Truth

233
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:19,039
Alex delusional

234
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:25,695
There is a part of me that believes that he believes it I was thinking the same thing I was thinking we're dealing with a believer

235
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,999
And that we

236
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:32,095
It's so sad knowing what we know now when he says

237
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:38,495
We in regards to him and Infowars yeah yeah

238
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:44,127
Throughout this that I really do get the feeling that he doesn't understand how little Alex cares

239
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,151
About him

240
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,687
How

241
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:52,319
Much as they wish they could just blame all this on the Fall Guy 8:30

242
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:55,135
It is it is a little bit of a bummer

243
00:15:55,391 --> 00:16:01,535
Cuz he does seem to think like world best friend

244
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,631
Is is 2 to remind yourself of like the attack part but

245
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:12,031
That dog goes home to his master does I call you I love you you're my favorite guy I think you're the best you make me happy all the time

246
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:18,431
Man's best friend

247
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:23,551
My bad to too many fun B-Max

248
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:29,951
Absolutely giving dad Dan Sebastian

249
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,999
He has a kid

250
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,071
I don't know his life

251
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,863
Anyway

252
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:41,215
There's some training at Infowars apparently

253
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:41,983
Not much

254
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,775
But a little bit of training

255
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,895
Well we got training therefore wasn't sauce use the language operation cover your ass

256
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:52,735
Okay based on when you make an accusation statement away to article or report

257
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,271
You put the proof where I comes

258
00:16:55,295 --> 00:17:01,183
And I'm going to people get to decide from there now if the source is wrong example ABC said

259
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,719
The sky is purple right

260
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,023
We will point the ABC said the sky is purple

261
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,071
No people

262
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,887
We're not going to rock we just recited

263
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,911
The information

264
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,679
And I mean

265
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,471
Now Sean gets back from Temple

266
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,495
Again frog then

267
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,799
Cuz yeah frazine in the Roundup

268
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:20,895
That's on record that was from Berkeley University we printed that out for him

269
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,943
Ignore you do with Satan

270
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,991
Information from Berkeley Medical

271
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:29,087
And then we'll find out he's getting chastises a gay frogman

272
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,135
That's the stuff we talked about because when you

273
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,159
Proper truth

274
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,719
That Wrecking the sources they don't want to hear that

275
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:41,119
So this is something that comes up a couple times this operation cover-your-ass which I guess is their way of

276
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:47,519
Saying use sources or or just like

277
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:52,383
Report factual information apparently robbed his way of like sort of

278
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:58,783
Sexying up Elemental Elementary

279
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,575
Don't make things up

280
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,391
Byj yeah it's

281
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,183
Kind of cute

282
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:11,583
If it wasn't Infowars I guess would be kind of cute wasn't one of the more evil or we need to be able to

283
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:16,447
To blame this on somebody else you can say whatever you want as long as you have a link

284
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:22,079
Boiler alert they almost never have

285
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:26,687
Every like a middle management employee and you hate your job and the people you work for

286
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:30,527
Cover your ass is fine but an Institutional business

287
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:34,367
With the policy of cover-your-ass is not a good business

288
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:38,207
Make it someone else's fault

289
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,535
Get out clean actually that's a little business

290
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:47,935
So badonde is a man who is known to use confrontation in his journalism

291
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:52,543
In the past and this is Sesame predates his time before he met Alex

292
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,823
Actually

293
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,895
He knew info Warriors before he knew Alex

294
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,943
The the idea of

295
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,991
Confrontation journalist

296
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,039
Yourself

297
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:03,807
As well correct

298
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:08,671
Yes and it's not confrontation as a physical it's a competition is like

299
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:13,023
Putting on the Spot while I collect questions and answers out-of-form somewhere

300
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,815
One public Peosta person

301
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,887
The other populations against

302
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,703
And I would have they answer the question or not that's

303
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,727
Not the point

304
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:26,079
But well that's why y'all he's going up to asking real questions that no other journals

305
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:29,919
What ask your man and I was doing the same thing my own Island

306
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,991
Those were words

307
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,807
Yeah dude

308
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,135
Before I even knew Alex Jones I was doing the same thing

309
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,207
Did you first hear about Alex

310
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,255
Oh wow

311
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,815
When I first got a radio

312
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:50,143
Show me Captain Captain like going on the news and all that

313
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:53,983
Can some report small trailers media and I Came Upon it for was

314
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,775
That I actually

315
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,311
Primavera

316
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,103
Hawaii

317
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,199
So I got to know who it was like more inside watching out showing shows

318
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:07,551
And not Grant I can only watch it everyday and I mean when I could

319
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:13,951
He knew Aaron Dykes yeah he's a producer and writer for Infowars who is

320
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:20,095
Laughed and does not like Alex him and his wife Melissa Melton both work

321
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,399
At Infowars and

322
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:28,031
They're mixed up in the Don Salazar we talked about them in that episode of the deposition because they were

323
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:31,871
Both sort of tertiarily involved in his reporting

324
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:35,199
On Sandy Hook stop

325
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:41,599
I imagine they did I don't I don't know the exact path through like I don't know if they came into informers already a cup

326
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:47,999
Or whatever but I only know that they're married because of the last episode

327
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:54,399
What they came up with the position we have the bow

328
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:59,263
Songs of an incredible romantic comedy alright propagandist

329
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:05,663
She's trying to have it all we have the makings of the next office we got jailed am right now

330
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:12,063
I will stay for awhile and then it's a will-they-won't-they deny that Sandy Hook happen

331
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:16,928
Write Rob do is Dwight Alex's of Michael Scott

332
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:22,816
Oh no yeah well I mean obviously Alex's is the Scott

333
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:26,144
Steve is a Creed

334
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,984
Oh boy

335
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:36,384
Let's see who else could we were kids from the cast of The Office

Is anyone there is actually responsible

339
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:48,672
I didn't force you like trying to do a good job that's a good question

340
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:55,072
Not at work I'm going to have to give Owen is at least

341
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,352
Trying something

342
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,704
Owen can also be Dwight anyway

343
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,776
Love's

344
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,056
The Constitution

345
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,336
This is important to him

346
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:11,712
Gloves the founding father

347
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,552
In about

348
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,832
2009

349
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,368
That

350
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,232
Alex Jones Kingdom

351
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,584
Thinking

352
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:32,704
Not just him in general I mean like I always been a critical big like that challenge

353
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,728
Enough

354
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:39,360
It's mainly went out that the TSA started when naked body skin as I do right about that time that's when

355
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,152
I really thought I'd get out

356
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:44,480
Becoming a good Viking 284 was

357
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:49,088
I went I had to help my own Tennessee protest here in Rhode Island

358
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,184
And y'all things like that and I was like

359
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,256
Anything which goes back to

360
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,024
History

361
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,352
When were the founding fathers were in person you know mean

362
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,144
At Thomas Paine I'm looking bike

363
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:08,800
Thomas Paine with me. Then you don't mean like he was doing what I'm doing today but if possible

364
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:14,176
And Cinderella and you can pick people like that's like these people

365
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,480
A revolutionary that standing up against

366
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,760
Old womanizer

367
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,528
Tyranny

368
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:22,112
And I mean would you work a stye they'll capsize back then

369
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,696
Do all the phone deposit they'll cash sizes nut balls back then

370
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:29,792
Conspiracy theorist everything

371
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:32,864
And I mean and not daycares away for this country and they

372
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,424
Quail you got tons and tons of quote that says

373
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:41,056
It is all job and I duty to keep that Liberty going in and secure Liberty is eternal vigilance

374
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,080
Atomic structure

375
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:49,248
According to Monticello this is not a quote that appears in any written or spoken history from Thomas Jefferson

376
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:55,648
The most likely origin of this quote is an Irish poet and lawyer named John Philpot current who said the condition upon

377
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:58,720
On which God have given Liberty to man is eternal vigilance

378
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,512
Which condition if you break

379
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,840
Servitude is at once the consequence of his prime

380
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,376
And the punishment of his guilt

381
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:11,776
All those Irish this was in the early 1800s after which point many speakers began using via quote and

382
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:14,080
I'm making this abbreviated too much more

383
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:18,944
Okay YouVersion who was first attributed to Jefferson and 1834

384
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,736
Which is after

385
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,552
It would have been popular already weird

386
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,320
Country

387
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:28,416
I'd like we have as a as a as a country

388
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:35,072
We have a habit towards miss making that isn't quite as it what we consider the the myths of

389
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:38,400
What did Rome tell itself Rome didn't tell itself

390
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:46,080
It's not a weird quote but the Greeks wear the band

391
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:50,432
Babies baby they gave Julius Caesar all of the quotes like all of the good

392
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:54,528
How old is Virgil they were just like I had Julia set up who cares

393
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:58,624
Possible it is possible but yeah it is a kind of

394
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:05,024
Soft version of mythologize I kind of bring this up constantly

395
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,376
Like whenever they deploy some of these spurious quote today is that like

396
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,544
Certain level they live in a fantasy of their own history and the myth

397
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,104
Assertive

398
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,784
Wistful patriotism patriotism

399
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:33,184
To the lights that people like in forest of course there's maybe a benign version of it we're like

400
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,000
You're not super connected to it and it doesn't make you

401
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:43,168
That's cream that all shootings are false flag maybe there's a benign version of

402
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:47,264
No I don't know if I don't know if anybody likes

403
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,288
Oh man

404
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,568
Abraham Lincoln

405
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,592
This dude

406
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,384
Delivered the most mail in a month

407
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,968
It's not crazy he was dead the all-time record holder

408
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:58,272
For most mail delivered in month

409
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,576
And he had this great quotes

410
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:03,648
Snoochie boochie

411
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:11,072
So he was he was he was drawn

412
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:11,840
To Alex

413
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:17,472
At least in part because of 9/11 conspiracy theories that he had

414
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,776
Ostler comes out right

415
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:22,848
Which is early in the deposition

416
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,384
And I found it shocking

417
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,920
One of the other

418
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,456
Stories that

419
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,480
Attracted you

420
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,528
Alex Jones was

421
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:33,088
His claims about 9/11

422
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,112
Correct

423
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,952
In the substance of that claim

424
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,768
Was that the United States government

425
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,304
Perpetrated the 9/11

426
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,584
Yes

427
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,632
I even though

428
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:48,192
Listen him I have my own questions because

429
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:51,008
I'm very knowledge near me from world end

430
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,080
Probably ridiculous

431
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,872
W.

432
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:04,320
I would minimum weight training to fly a 747 757 sorry into the towers like that

433
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,344
A precision

434
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,648
Especially the Pentagon 15 feet on the ground

435
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,672
Dark violet

436
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:12,512
So many laws of physics and everything else tonight that's where the questions are based off

437
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:16,096
Now listen Alex Jones coming up the same dairies and I'm like wow

438
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:22,752
So pretty weird moved to pardon my language slur

439
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:29,152
You're aware that what you're about to say is deeply inappropriate

440
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,712
My language if you're about to say that

441
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:36,576
I feel like if you recognize that this is an appropriate you could just say people

442
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:39,648
You're at a deposition this is a deposition

443
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,672
You know

444
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,464
By saying pardon my language

445
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,864
You're not supposed to say it at the very least here anywhere but definitely not here

446
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:55,520
Just can't not but these are these are like these little kernels of like the character of this person and

447
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:59,616
That's so weird that is a weird person

448
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,384
Yep

449
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,152
Yep

450
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,944
So

451
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,504
I think at a certain point

452
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,344
Batondy kind of realizes that if he's answering questions

453
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,880
He sounds dumb

454
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:17,536
Because the answers are good for the questions that are giving it so you'd rather not be asked questions

455
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:20,352
Early odd

456
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:23,680
He's he's got a little bit too far so he recognizes that

457
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:30,080
And now he's basically just going to try and stop the deposition at least focus it like really

458
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:36,480
Finally Center doll island

459
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:42,112
About 911 Colorado the Aurora shooting stuff

460
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,136
It doesn't work

461
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,696
Maybe

462
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,256
A sign of some kind of instinct

463
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:52,608
That is maybe better than a lot of the other people that need that means rooms

464
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,192
Before you go any further

465
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:03,872
We're here for the Sandy Hook thing why we dabble into things that that's going to build up a relevant cases for this whole operation

466
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,920
Rachel's going on I see the pad

467
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:11,040
Apache Jack what's going on the streets today Calcasieu until coconut balls make me look like

468
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:13,600
Kaspersky.com get to the Sandy Hook stop

469
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:18,976
That's okay

470
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:22,560
It's a rocking to the skates

471
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,096
Sometimes yet

472
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:27,424
None of this is ootoya relevant at all to send help

473
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:32,544
Mr. I appreciate your view on that

474
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:36,128
I have a different view there are reasons.

475
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:36,896
Asking

476
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,944
These questions I really don't know anybody

477
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,272
So, can you ask them

478
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,296
You're obligated

479
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,064
And answered

480
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,648
Impatient

481
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,416
Make it with them

482
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,464
So

483
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,536
That's not a personal attack on you sir I was just

484
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:58,656
Yeah that to the point in a locked door this is a robin where I worked is irrelevant to Sandy Hook

485
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,424
Where I went

486
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,288
Schools around with the Sandy Hook broadcast radio stations or irrelevant

487
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:09,664
I understand that you know I've been changed

488
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,016
I'm going to do my job

489
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,296
As long as it takes

490
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,088
And if that means coming back

491
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,368
Today to ask

492
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,440
Acquired

493
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,976
So

494
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,024
Go ahead and continue

495
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,560
And will be as efficient as we

496
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,328
Okay

497
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:35,264
Not not as much staying power to that Gus do as many as you might think there would be

498
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:41,664
Handling by Chris there I appreciate that

499
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,688
I ate you know what

500
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:45,248
You are making some very good points that I

501
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:50,624
Completely disregard this is a law I don't know how to explain laws to you but

502
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:57,024
You have a point and I disagree that point I think the opposite I'm ready to swear to that position

503
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:02,400
Tell you to do things by law

504
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:07,520
So but that instinct is good that cuz it's kind of like a

505
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:13,920
Or your hope it's going to work. I know that I'm coming in here to answer questions conceivably

506
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,456
We about Sandy Hook site

507
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:18,528
Maybe I've thought about it a little bit in advance right

508
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:24,160
I want to answer these questions I can think about advancement I can just point that out this is about Sandy Hook

509
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,208
Maybe the lawyers go along with Ryan

510
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:26,976
Rhetoric

511
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,000
It's

512
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,792
It's sad how

513
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:36,192
Again much like thinking Alex's friend unrealistic this is what did the hope is there

514
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:42,592
I appreciate that interesting that he's State you don't like the way that

515
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,872
Anywhere or the like

516
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:50,272
Went into these depositions was almost like a neat naive antolino like a dodo bird like they had no idea that the Predator was

517
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:53,856
Was right there in front of them and but dondi has this like

518
00:31:54,112 --> 00:32:00,256
It seems like he came up and touch the predator on the nose and is like Snot on it I get this I get what's happening here I got it back

519
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:03,584
Unfortunately

520
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,168
He is in the Trap

521
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:13,568
So Maddie asks about what is the the journalist job

522
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:16,640
Has like a really weird take

523
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,432
As a journalist with you

524
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,968
Would you agree with me

525
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:20,992
That

526
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,808
Part of the journalist's job

527
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,112
As you understand it was to ask questions

528
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,160
But then after asking those questions

529
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,464
To convey the truth of the matter

530
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,256
To your audience correct

531
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,024
Yes

532
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,656
In other words the point of asking the questions is so that you can accurately

533
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,424
Forum

534
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,960
Your audience correct

535
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:43,264
Yes and if there's only have two questions I'll be

536
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:47,360
Probably IQ questions and answers

537
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:50,176
That's my personal opinion but

538
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,480
Well however in a Midnight Judges Knox

539
00:32:55,296 --> 00:33:01,440
The terrorism these days he has a perspective that people not answering questions is a sign of their guilt

540
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,464
And

541
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,864
He is not answering questions after saying I don't want to answer this question

542
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,168
Right it's a little bit dissonant

543
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:16,800
And I mean even just like taking away the sort of hypocrisy there or whatever 8

544
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:20,640
Really f***** up view for someone who

545
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,664
Is it media

546
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,504
Orion in broadcasting and information

547
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,784
Dispensing

548
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,624
If you believe it someone not answering a question is indicative of their guilt

549
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,720
You cannot possibly as artane what's going on

550
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:38,560
You can't watch news to get watch a press conference and get

551
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:43,424
The point of things it's it's bad you're playing with like

552
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:49,824
Football with a broken leg anytime somebody's like no comment or like they definitely

553
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:55,968
Kildare County

554
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:56,992
Yeah

555
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,784
Very strange that's not good

556
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,064
So

557
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,856
Without Executives wish

558
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:05,184
And questions are asked about other things

559
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,232
And so the underwear bomber

560
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,000
Comes up

561
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:11,072
And he did a little bit of work on this

562
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:16,704
I just want to answer questions about it

563
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,496
Let me let me ask

564
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,544
Miracle

565
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,336
Weather mr. Jones

566
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,128
That

567
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,200
Unabomber the underwear

568
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:27,968
Armor

569
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,504
I was a federal

570
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,296
You recall whether or not he

571
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,856
What is this have to do with Sandy Hook

572
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:35,904
Beaver call weather now

573
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,208
I'm not going to answer No More Heroes

574
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,488
Questions I refused

575
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:44,608
This is outrageous in the you can call me back a million times I'll keep coming back

576
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:46,912
Did none of this has nothing to do with us

577
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:51,264
Okay this is nothing but a sap to make him look like a kook make me look like a goat

578
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,872
Nothing do what happened in Newtown Connecticut

579
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:00,224
And no

580
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:06,112
If you want

581
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:06,880
Okay

582
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:12,000
What'd he questioned the underwear bomber because the facts came out by the people who are on the plane

583
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:16,096
Date on record the lawyer attorney Kurt High School

584
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:22,496
Said the state department escorted around 6 ready to get on that flight even though he was denied by the airline.

585
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,824
That's the question to ask shoulders asking why

586
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,104
Why do they do that

587
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:33,504
Why so after the attempted Christmas Day bombing in 2009 Carrasco went public with some claims

588
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,880
How do you saw well-dressed man helping abdulmutallab get it sorted out to get boarded

589
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:41,952
Haunted flight 235 from Amsterdam to Detroit

590
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:47,584
Haskell claim that this person was trying to help abdulmutallab get on the plane without a passport but

591
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:53,984
This was happening in an area the airport where you should have already been passport screen and there's no one else who really corroborates the story

592
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,520
It all and even

593
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:59,616
Like accepting all of it he didn't claim it this was the state department thanks

594
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:06,016
Interpretation lipid and he's making past in terms of radicalization towards Terror

595
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:08,576
Pretty clearly well-established

596
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:14,976
He pled guilty in a fairly Agro and non repented way and not Haskell's claims went much further than

597
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,256
A guy saying something

598
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:21,888
He was interviewed by Outlets ranging from NPR to Infowars and no greater information ever came out

599
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:28,800
And then in 2012 Haskell decided to run for Congress in Michigan and he really didn't want to talk about that

600
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:33,408
I consider it part of my personal life and not part of my campaign

601
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,688
I don't think it's relevant

602
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,968
Sounds like he's guilty

603
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:38,528
It's debatable whether it's relevant or not

604
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:42,368
One could suggest that Haskell's actions speak to a lack of judgment

605
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:48,768
And the consequences of that Ripple to this day and are used by people like damn but don't need to justify their other conspiracy bull

606
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:49,792
Activities

607
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:55,680
And that kind of light maybe Haskell doesn't display leadership qualities that would justify him being in Congress

608
00:36:56,448 --> 00:37:00,800
And then there's a little bit of weirdness that comes out in his interview with NPR

609
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:07,456
When he's asked if it's possible that he got people confused and if it's possible to the person he saw with the well-dressed man with someone

610
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:09,504
He says it's not possible

611
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:16,160
The cause for concern was that he said that the well-dressed man referred to the person with him as Sudanese where is Abdul Mateen

612
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,696
Olive is Nigerian

613
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,488
Haskell explained quote

614
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:25,888
There were very few black man or black people on this flight and he's a rather different looking person to

615
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,168
So it's pretty obvious to me

616
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:33,312
I wonder what he means by different-looking because Abdullah Metallica's pretty normal-looking as far as I can tell

617
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:39,968
The things Haskell was saying immediately after the attempted attack were really interesting hence the little bit of news coverage and

618
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:44,064
That looks like a r but none of this is substantiated and none of it proves anything

619
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:50,720
But for someone like batondy and an outlet like Infowars one person saying something that they can use is the equivalent of a Smoking Gun

620
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,000
John the closes the case

621
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,536
They're not very rigorous

622
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:58,912
Is what I'm saying or even a decade later is still like

623
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:01,728
Citing this one thing this one guy said

624
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,496
As

625
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,544
Feel like proof positive that

626
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,592
Then of this underwear bombing was fake

627
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:09,408
In order to sell the naked body scanners

628
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:15,808
Yeah I'm going to have to say we all know what different-looking means in this context

629
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,600
And I

630
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:24,000
I don't know of any other history that he had that would corroborate this and I like another datapoint with Haskell chair but like

631
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,792
That comment is a little weird

632
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:32,192
I ate it seems a little razor state of note

633
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:38,336
Get a permanent record of subs or hot

634
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:44,480
The one thing that I noticed for sure throughout this deposition is the Tampa Dundee is

635
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:49,344
He's like one of those fire logs that has its own accelerant

636
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:54,720
He's speeds himself up

637
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:58,560
There isn't he does not need help getting going and just ramping

638
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:02,144
He goes from like answering a question to a rant

639
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:02,912
Like

640
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,192
Unprompted

641
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,472
Quite a few times

642
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:09,568
And so here's one example of that uses winding himself okay

643
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:12,640
These are the questions were bringing up in these of the valkyrie

644
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,664
Then I don't

645
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,200
Hear what the courts have to say

646
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,480
I'm not involved with this

647
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:20,576
Okay I'll speak my mind when I want a Halo that's the way it's going to go

648
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:26,976
And I'm not going to buy nobody else I stand for the Constitution the Bill of Rights might want Savior Jesus Christ was not

649
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,000
Damn thing

650
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:32,864
Did you hear anybody else I'll speak my mind to buy deathbyromy

651
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,936
And this is the way we're asking questions

652
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:39,520
We're out there trying to save this country for which left of it

653
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,312
At people like this in the media

654
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:47,456
Slime balls they want take they want to stay for free speech I want to talk about gun rights the very fundamental rights of

655
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,224
Dismiss

656
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:51,040
Let me know when standing up against

657
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,880
I'm going to speak

658
00:39:55,136 --> 00:40:00,768
Speak out and speak out of my head

659
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:04,352
The whole thing with the couch dozing drums

660
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,728
Workout inspiration

661
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:12,800
Despite them because he was a man

662
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:15,360
Batman we had balls

663
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,896
Steal that walk to anybody

664
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,944
I questioned them with all the requests

665
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,760
I was at the Boston Marathon

666
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,552
Reporters in the world

667
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,088
Nobody's asking to talk to answer

668
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,392
Questions

669
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,440
And also not being label all over the media

670
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,976
Especially

671
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:37,632
I asked if you were a large

672
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:41,216
Kaspersky lunatics

673
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:46,336
I haven't said anything

674
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,360
Jessie Jessie

675
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:51,456
I think you're a bad guy

676
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:55,040
Please let know it's not personal attack against you a night I don't think that was

677
00:40:55,552 --> 00:41:01,696
He reminds me a little bit also has me like on the phone with Xfinity

678
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,976
Okay

679
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:09,376
I'm sick of this internet going down at this is the fourth time this week I've called you I'm so sorry this is not about you

680
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:15,776
You're just doing your job I'm so sorry.

681
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:22,176
Talk to a person

682
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,712
Deal with this exact same abuse

683
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:30,112
All day I apologize I don't want to contribute to it that's on base there is a little bit of that that

684
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:36,512
Running right that instant recognition of like a look I'm not trying to be a dick to you

685
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:42,912
I'm just mad about the Constitution being attacked that's not you

686
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,216
Deposition but then again

687
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:51,616
Conceivably he should have just respect for Maddie because Maddie is the lawyer who is representing the thing

688
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:58,015
Thing that's supposed to be destroying the first and second amendment I mean he started with saying I literally don't care about the law

689
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:02,111
That is true and well. Shut up again

690
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:06,719
Promo from there's a godspeed You black Emperor Saga bbf3

691
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:08,255
+ 8

692
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:10,303
Him reading one of his poems

693
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:13,375
And telling the story about how he got a parking ticket and he's

694
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,679
The story winds up with him just being like

695
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:19,263
Listen judge I am not going to stop speaking in your cockroach

696
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:21,567
I am a person and I can do what I want

697
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:27,967
People up the river for 20 years with it and it's so good

698
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,735
Song is this

699
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:34,367
I'm so sorry but they're all people and I'm at

700
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:39,231
So before coming to Infowars like we've already touched on but dondi new Aaron dykes

701
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:42,815
And it turns out you knew him through an interesting way

702
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,863
Trina time that you were

703
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,399
Audiobooks

704
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,495
Did you ever reach out

705
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,031
Kim

706
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,311
Or

707
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,335
Anybody it in

708
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,359
Worst

709
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:59,967
Yeah I mean I already knew aerondight

710
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:03,295
From we are change cuz I barbecue

711
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:07,903
Organization called we are changed and I don't know if he was a member not by knew him

712
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:11,999
He actually seen a lot of my videos and all that make comments here and there

713
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:18,399
So yeah they knew each other through we are change which is the organization that was a 911 true thing to pick

714
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:24,799
Guy Ron Paul campaigning lucrative

715
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:28,383
Who is co-host great

716
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,151
I'm sick

717
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:35,039
These people

718
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:39,135
This again we get back to my least favorite thing

719
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:45,535
The naming of organizations we are change

720
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,071
Blended aspirational

721
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:53,471
It could be it could be like any kind of old thing like oh we need to save dolphins or something but no it's also

722
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,775
Do we need to bring fascism into America it's

723
00:43:56,031 --> 00:44:02,175
Yeah I believe that they got a little bit of traction to during like the Occupy Wall Street

724
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:08,575
Attach themselves a bit to that sounds like an organization

725
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:14,975
We're here for

726
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,743
Fraud

727
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,023
Fart again

728
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:23,679
So there's a non-disclosure agreement the badanti has signed but is unclear about exact

729
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,703
Glee what that cover

730
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:31,359
Answer the question comes up like what was your job when you got a job offer and how much it was

731
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:37,759
Job offer for the lawyer

732
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:40,575
A woman is the the lawyer whose

733
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,367
Representing Infowars

734
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:45,439
Dondie's side dish

735
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:50,559
And so there's no one really knows

736
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,095
This is

737
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:52,863
A

738
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,143
Adjust

739
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,423
Clean sweep

740
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:58,239
Of inability to just tell me what your job is

741
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:04,895
I understand that he has a different reason than other people's reasons but everybody can't just tell you what their job is

742
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:08,223
Well I think I think you know as we get further through this year

743
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:10,783
Get a better sense of what batondy does

744
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:13,087
Why did I think he tells

745
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:16,415
Probably more information about the like

746
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:20,767
Sticks and stones of what his his job is

747
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:23,071
But there is a little bit of difficulty

748
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,095
Out of the gate

749
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:26,399
So I did ask you

750
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:28,959
What the offer was in

751
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,727
You

752
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:32,543
Indicated that you weren't sure whether you can answer that question

753
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,079
Is that question that you ruined answer

754
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:37,407
Yeah we are males I'm certainly clarify the question

755
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:40,479
Is it the offer of the amount of the sorry

756
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:44,831
I'm asking you for the amount of the salary

757
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,879
The position that they were hiring

758
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:51,743
In any other benefits they may have offer to you with that

759
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:55,839
Six figures

760
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:58,143
They hire me as reported in a producer

761
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,727
And that that's public

762
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:04,031
And I'm sorry I don't know if I'm lost

763
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:04,799
Disclose

764
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:08,895
Family attorney that agrees with that I'll just close at

765
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:13,503
Probably not because of the non-disclosure agreement I don't want to wait like that

766
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:17,855
If you're comfortable disclosing your salary

767
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:18,879
You're welcome to do so

768
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,159
Caulking

769
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:25,023
I'll start it off while I'm sorry 45 thousand a year

770
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:27,071
And plus bonuses whenever

771
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:29,119
I will get a good story or something

772
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:35,519
So we know that Tony's other folks like Daria and Owen have substantially higher salaries than that

773
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:41,407
You know like a trip that's probably about like a

774
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:46,015
The equivalent of Owen salary now based on the size of Infowars

775
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:51,647
You know like I think that's a shockingly high salary for badonde a 2012

776
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:58,047
To be getting it Infowars I will say that one of the things that we haven't really kind of disgust because

777
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:01,631
Is it it's been glossed over for any number of million reasons but

778
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:08,287
This is yet another time where we've gotten the idea that you get a bonus

779
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:13,663
For a particularly juicy story and we know that juicy story does not mean

780
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:16,735
Like oh it's true you know it's

781
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:20,575
Did your b******* get traction you get a bonus

782
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:26,975
For making up things well there's there's even other layers to it to like once but on BB isn't an employee

783
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:29,535
Denny's was just a contractor or whatever

784
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:35,423
He's incentivized to come up with Juicy stories just to get all freelancer that point yet

785
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:37,471
And so you're not going to get paid anything

786
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,751
Unless this story

787
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:41,823
Is good and has legs and we can work with

788
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:48,223
And then Josh Owens in his piece of New York Times and other interviews he's talked about how

789
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:54,623
If you went out to do a story and it wasn't what Alex wanted you get in trouble

790
00:47:54,879 --> 00:48:01,023
Yelled at by him it was not the narrative that you were supposed to deliver exactly like there is a very

791
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:06,655
Free clear I mean like what you're talking about is like a financial and emotional incentive system

792
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:10,495
Do like a make things more salacious than more

793
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:16,383
I are detached from the truth

794
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:21,759
It's almost a bad system it's a terrible system it almost seems like

795
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:26,623
Inevitable that it would come to what it's come to

796
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:31,999
So we get back to the matter of training and operation cover-your-ass comes up again

797
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,119
Relating to your work as a journalist

798
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:46,847
Promotion stuff like I said I was going to do my own but I

799
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,127
Training I should say

800
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,151
Like advanced

801
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,087
And Mike you know how use the

802
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:58,367
Email system everything else

803
00:48:59,135 --> 00:48:59,903
Did you

804
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,439
Receive any training

805
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:05,023
Something to training concerning how to conduct yourself as a journalist

806
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:07,583
Once you arrived at fries be system

807
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:11,167
Oh just so simple just song

808
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:14,751
Operation cover-your-ass I mean like if you go to report something make sure you got

809
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,543
Documented facts so we don't

810
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:18,079
That is a big thing

811
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:21,407
And I and I just silence ironic

812
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:23,455
They actually use operation cover-your-ass

813
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,503
Yeah it was all Rob Ducharme

814
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,295
Just make sure you

815
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:31,135
Cuz I can

816
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:31,903
Yes

817
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,719
Okay and what did he explain

818
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:36,767
Batman

819
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:40,351
Batman basically if you are report something make sure you get

820
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:41,375
North Whitcomb

821
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:43,423
The salt trucks where it came from

822
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:45,215
And this way again like a

823
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:47,263
Explain early if somebody else

824
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:51,359
That should say CBS news for example said the sky is pink

825
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,151
Everybody says

826
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:53,919
Blue waffle

827
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:55,199
CBS News

828
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,479
Battle

829
00:49:56,991 --> 00:50:03,135
So and we provide is if it's the article

830
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:03,903
There's always

831
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:05,951
The sources

832
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,743
When people just click on read the bottom

833
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:11,071
That's what I wanted media ignored because where we post something we had

834
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:11,839
Sausage

835
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,631
Like the documents eyewear

836
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:17,215
Example we had all the sources at the bottom

837
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,751
And even the video link

838
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,287
Description we always provide the song

839
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:22,335
So we can come back on us

840
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,615
This Is War reporting

841
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:25,407
This is what's been you know

842
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:27,711
Whitney also that was the main focus

843
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:29,759
Just make sure you can come up some wildlife

844
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:34,623
Baseless conspiracy or whatever the case and window proof behind

845
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:36,927
Okay

846
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:38,975
Let the system did not work

847
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:39,743
Apparently

848
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:49,471
America do not have sources on the bottom of all their articles this is ridiculous

849
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:54,591
Did the as he ever read one of the articles that his videos were likely not

850
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:57,919
Yeah I do love the moment though of like did you get any training

851
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:04,319
Papa papa

852
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:06,879
We go to bed

853
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:13,023
Operation cover your right

854
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:15,327
Told not to get sued

855
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:21,727
And yet here we are the best laid plans

856
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:28,127
If only he had before hand or a little confused about that

857
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,151
Uncle

858
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:30,431
Gave him some training

859
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,967
But it isn't cool

860
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:34,527
I don't know about this

861
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:36,575
You mentioned earlier that you'd receive some

862
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:38,879
A journalism train from your uncle is that right

863
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:39,647
Yes

864
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,951
And what's your uncle's name

865
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:44,255

Cooper cooper like a

867
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,143
Co CDL

868
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:57,055
And mr. Trooper is Adventure

869
00:51:58,847 --> 00:51:59,871
Mother's brother

870
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,943
He's not official language

871
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:05,247
She's been in the family a long time one of those type deals

872
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,039
Norwalk

873
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:12,159
Uber for Boston I don't know I don't know how to explain this to you

874
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:18,559
Who did he work for

875
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:20,095
One of The Piano Guys

876
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:22,399
Great journalist

877
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:25,727
Whereabouts

878
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,263
A problem

879
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:31,871
He said he work for several news outlets as a journalist

880
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:35,455
Yeah and I independent like you and I

881
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,991
Like it was

882
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:40,319
Something going on people go today and they need this promoted

883
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,087
He would

884
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,159
What is pure sources reach out to other media Outlets

885
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,951

Anime

887
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,023
Used to set up a persuasive

888
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:49,791
Install the media

889
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,327
That's not a journalist

890
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:57,727
So you got turn wasn't raining from his uncle who isn't his uncle and wasn't a journalist

891
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:02,079
Journalism training from a PR guys

892
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,103
Who's not his uncle

893
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:07,967
Which I mean considering where he works that is the training that you might

894
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:08,991
Want this

895
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:15,391
Yeah I mean like a publicist type person is basically just trying to get attention to things

896
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:20,255
Liar Wars is essentially just an intention aggregator so

897
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:23,583
I mean it is appropriate it just not Journal journalist

898
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:31,519
Yeah it's his butt and he's not Uncle Bobby

899
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,543
We calling Koop

900
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:33,823
Bad

901
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:40,223
He also ran the radio station the patandi was on because all of these people

902
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:42,271
Am I correct that as for

903
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,039
Did you know

904
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:45,343
Did not work

905
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,111
Or

906
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:46,879
A

907
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:49,439
Media outlet that published

908
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,255
Information

909
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,023
Republic

910
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,559
Yeah you are

911
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:56,351
He was running the radio station

912
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,655
And we were CBS affiliate

913
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:06,079
He works for your radio station

914
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:08,127
He was our station manager

915
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,943
And he's the one

916
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:14,015
That Rihanna station and we are CBS affiliate

917
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:17,087
Okay

918
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:23,487
Okay and my uncle was a volunteer firefighter he also

919
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,767
Of the carwash

920
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:28,351
He does any number anyways my uncle doesn't actually have a job

921
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:31,423
But he trains me in journal

922
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:35,519
So when you're talkin about her no one talks about what their job is

923
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:36,287
Sprite

924
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:43,967
He actually has some details and I think these details actually reveal quite a bit about how things work

925
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:45,759
And how the broadcast is made

926
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:48,575
Your producer 40 is that right

927
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:52,159
Oh yes I will show show

928
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:55,231
Radio show

929
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:56,767
And

930
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:58,047
What did that

931
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,071
Entail

932
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:03,935
Algaecide patient when he's talking what I'm doing to get there early in the morning

933
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:07,775
I'll print up all the Articles from Mike eversource imaginable and

934
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:10,079
I would separate them into certain categories

935
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:15,455
And I'm so Bickley US news world news

936
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:18,015
2nd Amendment news stuff like that you can

937
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:22,879
Explains it right and what I'll do is I'll put them on his desk he'll go to the articles

938
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:25,951
Decide we want to talk about in the meantime while he's on the ear

939
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:30,559
Will have several computers going on and I do with tricaster and everything

940
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:38,751
977 the space preservation Act

941
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,031
The 2001

942
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:44,383
The back that up might got was a backup. The show

943
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:49,247
On-screen you think you did software this way you talked about me so I can coming out of his butt

944
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:51,039
This is from documents or so

945
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:53,087
Space preservation Act

946
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:56,927
I pulled up right from the DACA website

947
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:57,695
What radon

948
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,743
So

949
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:02,815
The shirt narcos

950
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:05,887
Yeah yeah. Uncle there but sometimes we pull up on screen

951
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:11,007
As he's talking about Airman General things like that

952
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,287
To be supportive

953
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:15,103
Queen show

954
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:18,943
Yo that's not we we we have a thousand things and ahead of time

955
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:21,759
You get stumbled on something

956
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:24,319
I could be on the microphone I can't I'll know that was

957
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:25,855
Hey truck 977

958
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:27,391
Yeah man if he stumbled on

959
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,159
Remember

960
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:31,231
Things like that and I mean that in that nature and also producing

961
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:34,047
Told him when I got a break and y'all got kind of nature

962
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:37,375
That's really helpful so

963
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:40,447
When when you were producing The Alex Jones Show

964
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:42,239
Would you be the guy in Alex's year

965
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,263
One of them yes

966
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,543
That's wild

967
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:48,127
And he's one of the people in his earpiece

968
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:51,199
That fog.

969
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:52,223
Blows my mind

970
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:58,367
Right but it doesn't mean it doesn't sort of work towards some of the ideas that I've had about

971
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,391
Like

972
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:05,791
Obsession with being teleprompter free is a little bit less impressive when you realize that he has producers

973
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,583
We were just feeding him things through his earpiece

974
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:13,983
Yeah like he has them telling him document numbers and documents and stuff like that

975
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:14,751
The Giver

976
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:18,847
It's like a magic trick where he has the appearance of knowing all of this stuff

977
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:19,615
When he's

978
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:23,199
Conceivably getting told those things

979
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:29,599
It's really just a different scale which is being able to speak and hear things at the same time

980
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:30,879
You could do with practice

981
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:37,279
Much better than easier than learning I mean he's comes from the televangelism

982
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:39,583
Farewell radio evangelism background

983
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:43,935
And I have no doubt that he seen somebody call out

984
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:50,335
Is that is there a Chabad in here tonight and Ben like I

985
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:56,735
I got what you're doing but don't even says one point like if he gets stuck on something

986
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:58,015
You know like there

987
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,039
There's like

988
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,575
Conceivably

989
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:03,903
You know even topics and stuff like

990
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:07,999
Here is a thing that you know like if you're running out of gas and you like

991
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,023
It's

992
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:14,911
There is a lot of cheating that could go on based on the description that bidani gives of how the

993
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:16,703
The earpiece producing

994
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:18,495
Panda

995
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:20,287
I would be surprised there's a whole lot of that

996
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:25,151
But beyond that but I also just did some important f****** work

997
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,687
While he was at Infowars

998
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:27,967
You also a reporter

999
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:34,111
When you were down in Austin so in addition to your producing responsibilities I take it you

1000
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:36,415
Go out in

1001
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:37,439
Create Khan

1002
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:38,207
Correct

1003
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:39,487
Yes I will

1004
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:43,071
We'll take off

1005
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:45,119
My mainly report was a man on a

1006
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:47,679
Street we just go question the public what they thought

1007
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:51,519
Certain topics that were in the media at the time hot you're hot topic like

1008
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:55,103
No control abortion things like that matter

1009
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:59,455
And also questionable quizzes like if they knew

1010
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:01,503
Just wait a while

1011
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:04,831
Two of the remnants of the

1012
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:07,647
Things like that are nature

1013
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:10,207
Who the vice president

1014
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,743
The questions like that

1015
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:13,279
The point was to get the Publix

1016
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,559
Opinion of

1017
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:15,583
What the topic

1018
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:17,119
Say nothing to me you were going on

1019
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,655
Officials

1020
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:23,519
We're tired of hearing from the suits in the mainstream media we wanted to jaywalk

1021
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:25,567
Do man on the street babe

1022
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:31,455
Where we ask drunk people on the boardwalk silly question and trap them and make them

1023
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:37,855
Appear dumber than they are haha

1024
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:42,207
Here because I think I genuinely want to know how he sees the world

1025
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:43,487
Because

1026
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:44,255
It's

1027
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:45,279
Weird

1028
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,815
I don't know if you do

1029
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:48,095
That's fair

1030
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:55,263
I don't know I just feel like he sees things in that I don't know what is real in his world

1031
00:59:55,775 --> 01:00:01,919
Well he apparently has a show that he does about spiritual warfare and demons and stuff so that's why

1032
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:02,687
I'm out

1033
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:09,087
Okay yeah maybe I have a little more information than that then you do about why you don't actually want this

1034
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:10,879
Possible is that the premise of the show

1035
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:11,647
What

1036
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:17,279
That you have more I thought you meant

1037
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:18,815
At certain point

1038
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:20,095
Batondy

1039
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:21,375
I got let go

1040
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:22,399

1041
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:23,679
You still

1042
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:30,079
With Infowars but he was let go of his his actual position producing

1043

Probationary. And ended up going back to Rhode Island

1044

Thanksgiving

Screaming

1053

The office

1054
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:15,391
The first sound was off

1055
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:16,671
Well let go

1056

Fortune misunderstandings whatever case in the video

1058
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:25,375
Specific reason why they let me go

1059
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:27,423
Me and a bunch of the people

1060
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:29,471
It's like normal.

1061
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,239
He was dropped

1062
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,519
McFly's gentlemen

1063
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:34,591
And it's the nature of the business young meaning

1064
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:37,919
Because we'd been entertained business and also

1065
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:39,711
Mediabase

1066
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:44,831
Don't know why

1067
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:45,599
No

1068
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:47,391
You don't know if I would ever

1069
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:50,975
He'll pretty chill attitude toward today

1070
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:56,607
Yeah it sounds like he got yelled at a bunch and then whenever they were like okay man we're going to

1071
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:57,375
Get out of that

1072
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:59,679
Call away

1073
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:06,079
Well we got a lot of moving parts we won't say that we're going to keep you on as a correspondence so long as you are so

1074
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:07,359
Several thousand miles away from us

1075
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:13,759
And you give us juicy stories some reasons that he apparently

1076
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:18,367
And one of them is a bit of a misunderstanding it's really just it's no big deal

1077
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,391
Block

1078
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:20,927
Sometimes

1079
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:23,487
Scheduling conflict happen

1080
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:25,279
I'll be in the foot

1081
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:27,327
They're not that severe

1082
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,863
Emotionally perhaps

1083
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:32,447
Be at there was an agenda 21 conference

1084
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:37,567
And I just mean to sustainable development that thing that they're calling it into 21

1085
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:40,895
And batondy wife but he wasn't supposed to

1086
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,175
What's your under

1087
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:43,711
Specifically

1088
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,391
In Elgin Texas

1089
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:54,463
Since we go to recycle basic Jenny 21 then

1090
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:56,511
Anna Jaques sustainability

1091
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:57,535
Conference hearing

1092
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:03,423
They were getting ready to go in the morning

1093
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,447
Mission

1094
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:05,215
Go

1095
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:07,775
Yeah I was told yes

1096
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:09,823
So what had to go out

1097
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:10,591
Do you want

1098
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:11,359
Get my suit tailor

1099
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:13,919
So I had no knowledge later that

1100
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:15,199
Auction changes mine

1101
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:16,991
And I know so I had to

1102
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:23,135
Yeah

1103
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:24,159
Why'd you go easy

1104
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:29,279
Chew me out and I'm like yeah I went because you told me you could remember that in the morning

1105
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:31,583
Because yeah you're right yeah I did but

1106
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:32,607
I told you

1107
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:33,631
No I left the office

1108
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:36,447
Okay I'm sorry and

1109
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:38,751
Lumos understands like

1110
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:41,823
And you know things like that which

1111
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:45,151
Because I don't know it's just a bunch of

1112
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:45,919
Things like that

1113
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:47,199
Little miscommunication

1114
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:51,551
The communicate I mean I love the forest of death I love the people there but

1115
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:52,319
Communication

1116
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:54,367
The appointment

1117
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:57,951
Naproxen

1118
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:02,303
So

1119
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:04,095
It's a miscommunication

1120
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:07,167
In the morning you told badonde to go

1121
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:09,727
Taylor.

1122
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:14,847
Realize that Alex didn't want him to go after all he comes back courthouse is like what the fuc

1123
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:16,383
And then you're fired

1124
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:23,807
It's definitely not a situation where there's more going on here I can't think of anything else that might be involved

1125
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:27,647
Information nothing more going on well I mean

1126
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:29,183
Is there more going on

1127
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:37,631
No I wasn't

1128
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:39,167
Tuportal

1129
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,191
Recruit members

1130
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:41,983
You make the report

1131
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,615
Yeah because what will happen once

1132
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:49,151
We outside

1133
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:49,919
Some questions

1134
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:57,087
So we have some questions and it caused a lot of people with no prize because we told people to

1135
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:59,903
It's not what you think it is his Agenda 21

1136
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:02,207
And the people young Texas you don't mess with

1137
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:04,767
This is about

1138
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:07,839
It was kind of an uproar they were yelling screaming

1139
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:09,887
And yeah we're not going to do this

1140
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,959
United Nation stuff yet

1141
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:13,983
So

1142
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,287
Someone the people in the car

1143
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:18,847
And the police came in

1144
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,127
They asked

1145
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,919
This Friday at the time in the

1146
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,599
Anyway

1147
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:31,647
Big discussion

1148
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:33,183
The police Roxanne

1149
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:35,231
So we go back to dinner

1150
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:40,351
Yeah you told me I could go

1151
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:41,375
Weather miscommunication

1152
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:45,215
And it's just a lot of miscommunications that because

1153
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:48,287
And his defense all I mean it is such a huge

1154
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:54,943
Such a huge operation I'm guessing that Alex's problem wasn't his presents the police

1155
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:56,991
Involved in Alex's defense

1156
01:05:57,247 --> 01:06:03,391
I did start a riot the cops were called I got into a fight with a cop right

1157
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:09,791
They could have something to do with those parts of my story

1158
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:16,191
Solutely communication exactly the real the real breakdown was

1159
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:22,591
Video of this somewhere I couldn't find the actual video of badonde at this event video of

1160
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:25,407
After he got thrown out of the event

1161
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,175
A.m.

1162
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:32,575
It turns out the story is a little bit different so what happened was that

1163
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:38,463
He called some lady who is there one of people involved in the the event

1164
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:41,791
Okay so she asked the police

1165
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:48,191
To remove him with police

1166
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:52,543
The heroic I started a riot with my Texas Buddies

1167
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:54,847
Add we overtook to the store

1168
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:57,663
It is instead

1169
01:06:57,919 --> 01:07:04,063
Hey you suck and then they get kicked out

1170
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:10,463
Somebody right now they've been happening at their event. So he was asked to leave

1171
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:16,863
I don't even know

1172
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:17,887
He's in trouble

1173
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:19,423
Okay so yeah

1174
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:24,543
So the story is now I went there I didn't get much

1175
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:27,871
And then I got thrown out and then I got into a fight with the cops

1176
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:31,711
Right at where is it if you understand the starting point was

1177
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:38,111
Look I didn't know that Alex said I shouldn't have gone to Livermore

1178
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:38,879
Different

1179
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:45,535
Issue then what baby I would see is a fireable offense somewhere along the line

1180
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,303
Alex

1181
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:47,839
I like

1182
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:54,239
Run-ins with the police are opportunities that have to be handled pretty smoothly with Alex

1183
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:57,567
Loves to get into like a little bit of a confrontation with a with a cop

1184
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:01,919
Yes I'm Savvy he knows how to maximize whatever you're going to get out of it

1185
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:03,711
Not get into any trouble

1186
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:05,759
Where summerlake batondy is not

1187
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:10,879
That is a liability him being around cops and specially getting into a confrontation with him

1188
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:15,743
Especially on being there under the auspices of the Infowars organization like

1189
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:22,399
That's the only is negative be pretty pissed about it he's got the

1190
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:28,799
The cloak of a little of Fame do it so they don't want to like a rest of it caused a big thing and that'll be a mess

1191
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:31,615
Where is with badonde it's like man

1192
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:38,527
We can take you away the Alex will have some kind of like inciting thing

1193
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:41,599
That is like at least defensible like

1194
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:47,999
You know he'll I don't think the police got involved but like we went to the DMV and refused to give his fingerprints or what

1195
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:54,399
Whatever kind of principal you can stand on where is just being a dick to this lady

1196
01:08:54,655 --> 01:09:00,799
Show you ID and I can be a dick to that lady all I want right it's not doesn't have the same last offensively

1197
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:03,359
So were there any other reasons

1198
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:09,759
That Alex gave for letting you go already

1199
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:16,159
And we know from Alex's that position that he let him go because he saw that Sandy Hook report he said Bishop

1200
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:22,559
100% the reason that he was let go shut it down. Lee is no good

1201
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:24,095
Apparently

1202
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:25,631
Other than

1203
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:32,799
With any other

1204
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:40,991
Not right

1205
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:46,623
I didn't report

1206
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:47,391
Using the

1207
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,415
Studio

1208
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,207
Yeah my car

1209
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:51,743
The new show forever case

1210
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:53,791
He knew about it but he

1211
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:57,375
I don't sweat nobody but you didn't

1212
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:59,423
It was like you said was

1213
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:02,751
A debate altogether about

1214
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:04,031
He uses things

1215
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,311
This is the reason

1216
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:07,871
Yeah the other not in a man

1217
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:12,991
But he did you know Steve will keep his correspondent so he didn't realize I was like

1218
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:14,527
Complications of self self

1219
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:20,927
There's apparently but Dante was using the studio for his own like show whatever

1220
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:27,327
Believes he had permission and then a little bit later you did not have permission and this became an issue these are the reasons

1221
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:33,727
Are you sleep like a whole thing makes perfect

1222
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:35,519
Regards to Infowars now because

1223
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:37,823
Clearly in his audition

1224
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:41,407
He has proved himself to be an agent of true chaos

1225
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,431
You know

1226
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:44,223
While he's while he's there

1227
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:48,319
He's showing up doing a show what's up dude

1228
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:54,463
You want the Kraken but not in how hot it how so you send it back there and you like you can stay as a correspondent

1229
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:58,303
We have a Chaos Agent that could be useful

1230
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:04,703
Or keep you at arm's length that's always a good idea to have a loose cannon this all makes total sense in terms of

1231
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:11,103
Like piecing together various people's versions of what happened but I do want to f****** contest and

1232
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:17,503
He ended up winning over second-place because he interviewed Ron Paul into it like all this is going to be good

1233
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:23,903
So he gets in at Infowars he has a tryout. I eat bombs it absolutely they do fight with

1234
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:30,303
The cop at 8 to 21 conference studio for unauthorised recent

1235
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:36,703
Obviously you want to just let him go course

1236
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:43,103
S4mm

1237
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:47,199
Basis of you like a freelance kind of stealthily Maybe

1238
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:48,735
If it's worth it

1239
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:52,319
Makes total sense and then you want to associate

1240
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:58,719
More when he does stuff like goes to the Boston bombing course press conference at crowd of people

1241
01:11:58,975 --> 01:11:59,487
Yeah

1242
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:04,863
I see you have him as like an employee not employee after that that.

1243
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:09,471
Angela cover-your-ass what

1244
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:11,263
Yep so that all makes sense

1245
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:17,151
Yeah but there's something this is some prime funny stuff Alex

1246
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:19,711
Didn't even have the balls to fire

1247
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:25,855
Vedonde listen to this sounds like some

1248
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:27,391
It was mr. Jones

1249
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:36,351
I know he actually was weird

1250
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:37,631
Because I'm nobody's New York

1251
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:40,191

01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:48,895
Walks away then Rob do comes over

1256
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:49,919

1257
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:52,223
Right they know something's wrong

1258
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:54,271

1263
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:06,559
Devoid

1264
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:08,863
Alex himself never Direct

1265
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:11,935
I told me until I got on the phone when I left the place

1266
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:16,287
I want a dementor knows exactly why and I mean

1267
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:17,055
Discussion

1268
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:18,591
After you quit me to do this

1269
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:19,615
Sofia you forgot

1270
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:23,199
So you guys what we know what we'll do this

1271
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:24,223
The guy you need to go home

1272
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:25,247
Safiya-malika Sarah

1273
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:29,343
God be with your family cuz you said they don't to move down here whatever

1274
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:30,111
Okay so

1275
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:31,391
He said we'll keep yawning

1276
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:33,951
Alright

1277
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:40,351
Alex gave him the kiss of death wow

1278
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:46,751
Milwaukee I love you we got along together

1279
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:53,151
I'm going to get out of here in a locker room

1280
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:57,503
So obvious that moment that might clear what was going on

1281
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:02,367
Everybody seems to not be aware of how choreographed that is

1282
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:09,023
I know it was you and he's free though

1283
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:11,327
Ghostin pretty-much

1284
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:17,727
Alex just I mean he's apparently pretty good at like preserving some image

1285
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:24,127
Whatever like I do I don't want but Auntie mad at me no no no

1286
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:27,199
Cry while you fire it no way they cried

1287
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:29,247
I love the dundies

1288
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:31,039
Fake person

1289
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:37,695
They've known him for a couple months after the time he was there I got

1290
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:44,095
Cops and everytime I think about it you claim to fame as you got an interview with

1291
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:50,495
Ron Paul like comes on Alex's show

1292
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:52,543
Collected depositions

1293
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:56,895
Could be viewed as like a long-form rashomon

1294
01:14:57,407 --> 01:15:03,551
It's an oral history everybody's got their own views on what happened and where and how

1295
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:09,951
None of it's real well here's the thing I think that baton to use the least sin

1296
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:14,303
Pinnacle version of the story

1297
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:16,095
This is what happened

1298
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,887
But his interpretation

1299
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:19,935
Is naughty I believe

1300
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:24,799
That in his mind everyone is played by anthropomorphic animals

1301
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:31,199
When he goes around Alex is a giant lion roars all that Rob Dewey

1302
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:34,527
I'm just doing Lion King again

1303
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:38,111
Who is booba

1304
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:44,511
I think Owen Shroyer has got to be a poop

1305
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:50,911
David Jones himself doctor

1306
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:57,823
Antique china kisscartoon

1307
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:01,407
That makes you a hyena

1308
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:06,015
Oh

1309
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:09,343
I'll take that so the question really is on everyone's mind

1310
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:12,159
That is do you think that if you didn't

1311
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:15,999
Need to move back to to Rhode Island

1312
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:20,863
That's beautiful family do you think that Alex would have kept you on as an employee

1313
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:24,447
And this is at Freddy's just being mean now

1314
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:25,471
Conclusion of York

1315
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:26,239
Call Whitney

1316
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:28,287
Had your

1317
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:29,311
Beyonce been willing

1318
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:37,247
Police said that was a choice but family

1319
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:41,343
Time is with Kelly and all that and

1320
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:42,879
But he walked

1321
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:45,951
And that's what he said you got a Bugatti

1322
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:53,375
Do you got a one-year-old

1323
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:55,679
So what you was right at home

1324
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:59,007
And be flying back and forth every other week or whatever your name is

1325
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:02,591
Supportive family in that manner

1326
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:04,895
Financially yes

1327
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:06,943
Being a physical father you know

1328
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:13,599
Good on him for you know like stepping up to be a dad and all that but this is ridiculous the way

1329
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:15,903
Galaxy

1330
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:22,303
I would love to keep you around but I don't understand did but he just say that he was

1331
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:28,703
Basically commuting from Rhode Island to Arlington Texas

1332
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:35,103
I know it's not why all expired him but he should view that as like a Grace

1333
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:43,551
This is just grasping at straws for ways to be a coward about firing people

1334
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:45,855
For your kid

1335
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:50,975
Contrary to popular belief I am terrified of calculus

1336
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:57,375
I like conflict when its performance I don't like it when it's with the people I choose to be

1337
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:05,311
And then I'll get mad and then God knows what could happen since we all carry

1338
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:11,711
Knows maybe I'll Rapstar deny the Holocaust on my show

1339
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:21,183
So now we finally get to questions that surround Sandy Hook and so he asks where

1340
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:25,023
Where he was when he heard about the shooting

1341
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:27,071
And it turns out

1342
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:29,631
Direct answer

1343
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:32,703
Where were you when you learned that there

1344
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:42,175
It was December of 2012

1345
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:48,319
What was definitely back in what island

1346
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:52,415
I heard about the

1347
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:55,487
It's funny because

1348
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:57,791
Week before The Happening

1349
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:58,559
Those on my radio

1350
01:18:58,815 --> 01:18:59,583
Showing

1351
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:00,607
People back

1352
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:03,679
This feeling

1353
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:06,495
Argument outside

1354
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,079
Feeling that

1355
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:11,103
Is a heavy push for

1356
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:12,895
They're going to be

1357
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:15,199
Fox 4 digit I mean

1358
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,735
And I remember that

1359
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:17,759
Happen

1360
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:18,783
I was on the show

1361
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:21,087
And I

1362
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:22,111
People called that

1363
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:23,135
Like when you predict

1364
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:25,439
Just like

1365
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:31,583
And went away again

1366
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:32,607
Before the kids body

1367
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:37,215
Ebony

1368
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:45,151
And I was quiet on ya

1369
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:53,343
Happened

1370
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,879
Well you know I'm not saying

1371
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:09,727
Midnight

1372
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:13,567
I know that

1373
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:17,152
Strong objections

1374
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:20,480
The effort

1375
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:22,528
Controller

1376
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,112
And I know that

1377
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:27,136
You got to

1378
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,208
You express that on

1379
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:34,816
I wanted to ask you about

1380
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:36,864
Do you remember

1381
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:38,400
Today

1382
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:39,424
Where you were when you

1383
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:48,896
I took this at that

1384
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:55,552
Yep they didn't have to do the whole thing 2 minutes of rambling about your feelings by gun-control Inlet

1385
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:57,088
Have you and Lexie home

1386
01:20:57,344 --> 01:21:03,488
I mean like that's a direct question he asked question

1387
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:08,864
Pretty pretty constantly cuz of that I feel like he trained with a

1388
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:12,192
Elementary school guidance counselor or something

1389
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:13,728
Something along those lines of like

1390
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:15,264
II

1391
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:18,080
Also he understand what you're saying

1392
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:19,872
If Andy was funny

1393
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:26,784
You would have said like I was on are crying I had tears in my eyes like Rob do fire and somebody

1394
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:33,952
That would have been nice pieces in between when he was fired and when Sandy Hook

1395
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:37,280
When are you started going out I'm sure he did but also like

1396
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:43,680
I guessing when he says he was on air he has his own show

1397
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:50,080
More doing his own stop right

1398
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:56,480
Was Dan badonde interviewing Val venis

1399
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:59,296
Little things that he did here and there in just

1400
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:03,392
Like this it wasn't like he got fired went back to Rhode Island and then pop back up

1401
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:06,720
Just for the the how big

1402
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:07,744
Foia hearing

1403
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:13,120
Yeah I don't know a lot of them are probably just very forgettable

1404
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:15,424
Yeah it is it's just like

1405
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:18,752
It is so weird to have him

1406
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:21,568
Letgo sent back to Rhode Island

1407
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:24,384
And then only a short. Later

1408
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,432
Become so Central to their

1409
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:32,832
Identity for a while though

1410
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:38,976
Whatever he may have done as it relates to Sandy Hook his relevance with

1411
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:46,912
Infowars end of the coverage does relate to the Wolfgang halbig for you hearing right which weren't

1412
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:47,936
Immediate

1413
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:54,336
Right there was a there was a bit of a lapse or a gap between the shooting the aftermath The Fallout the consumed

1414
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,104
Pharisees

1415
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:59,200
A man how big showing up like 2014 ish

1416
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:02,528
So like there is there it there's a bit of

1417
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:05,600
Time between is firing in that.

1418
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:12,256
Bi that would be wild if it was just like right away

1419
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:13,792
Auto Rhode Island yeah

1420
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:20,448
But batondy is somebody was curious

1421
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:23,520
Version of his own thoughts about

1422
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:26,080
Sandy Hook in whether it was fake or not

1423
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:29,920
He doesn't want to admit something

1424
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:30,688
Well

1425
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:37,344
But if Charlotte Russe cat has been revealed long ago

1426
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:41,184
I know you can still see it

1427
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:45,024
Yeah but maybe not it might be was all Theory that's

1428
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:47,072
That nobody died at Sandy Hook

1429
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:47,840
Correct

1430
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:49,120
No

1431
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:50,144
You've never said

1432
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:51,424
No

1433
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:53,472
We did that

1434
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:56,288
I mean at first when I

1435
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:58,848
I'm about to stop by my head was go to mile minute

1436
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,896
And that's when Wolfgang halbig

1437
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:02,176
Lynn Hughes.

1438
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:03,712
School safety inspector

1439
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,248
He started raising

1440
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:10,112
I actually had my said something like that

1441
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:11,904
Cancel.

1442
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:13,440
Call Gee

1443

Middlebury

1445
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:22,912
What do you apologize

1446
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:23,680
Store

1447
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:24,448
Was

1448
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:25,728
The fact that

1449
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:26,496
Somebody

1450
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:28,032
Had released

1451
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:28,800
The purse

1452
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:29,568
The identify

1453
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:30,848
Find information of the

1454
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:34,432
You didn't apologize for any view you had previously

1455
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:35,200
Express

1456
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:35,968
That no children

1457
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:38,784
Yes that's why

1458
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:40,576
Diana

1459
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:42,624
But what you just say

1460
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:45,184
With me that you have

1461
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:46,464
Stated

1462
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:48,000
That nobody died

1463
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:49,280
Correct

1464
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:52,096
Is there an extra

1465
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:53,376
30 mine

1466
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:56,960
Questions

1467
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:58,240
That need answering

1468
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:04,640
So there is a sort of ball rolling down hill aspect to this where it's like I didn't say that Noah

1469
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:05,920
You did

1470
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:11,040
Well yeah I did but I recanted and I apologized

1471
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:17,440
Yes I did and also it was all just Theory alright this is not

1472
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:18,976
Upfront this is

1473
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:25,376
This is somebody who's not answering the question

1474
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:31,776
He's like a bad murder investigation like did you kill that guy absolutely not I killed that way

1475
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:38,176
I killed him a little bit kill bad guy a little bit if I apologize to his parents you didn't

1476
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:44,064
Well I said I was sorry that their shoes got wet and I think that encompasses

1477
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:50,464
Dummy killing their kids saying and if I did was an accident and in reality he killed me frankly I don't

1478
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,256
Even know if he ever existed right

1479
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:54,560
So look is asking question

1480
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:57,376
Questions

1481
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:58,656
This is a fact.

1482
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:00,192
I never said

1483
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:02,752
Is the kids dying

1484
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:05,312
And I mean those with the state

1485
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:06,080
If I made and I

1486
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:07,104
Cuz I don't know

1487
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:08,896
I wasn't there I don't know what

1488
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:10,176
Peyton

1489
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:11,712
Why no nausea

1490
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:14,016
The game

1491
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:14,784
It's all

1492
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:16,064
Ever since then

1493
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,600
Rena

1494
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:18,368
Caribou

1495
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:22,464
I mean and that's Murchison

1496
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,232
What's

1497
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,560
Anybody

1498
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:30,400
Your Day desserts

1499
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:33,728
Johnny I'm going to show you

1500
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:37,568
You have

1501
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:42,432
A document on your

1502
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:43,200
Green

1503
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:44,992
In which

1504
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:47,040
You

1505
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:49,600
Meeting is at dhanbad on D

1506
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:51,136
Yep

1507
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:52,672
And

1508
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:54,208
As I scroll down to

1509
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:54,976
The bottom

1510
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:56,512
You see where you reply

1511
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:58,304
Sandy Hook no one died

1512
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:03,936
What's the date

1513
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:05,216
Why 2000

1514
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:07,520
16

1515
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:08,544
Am I correct

1516
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:10,848
That you stated that standing hook Noah

1517
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:12,896
Well yes

1518
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:15,456
Right and you didn't phrase it as a

1519
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:18,784
Where did he

1520
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:19,552
Sammy Diner

1521
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:20,320
And that was

1522
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:21,088
My question

1523
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,136
So did you break that as a question

1524
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:26,976
Direction

1525
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:29,792
Did you phrase it as a question

1526
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:40,032
Oh it's like it's like we understood you at the beginning of a

1527
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:45,408
The command you know it's like a it's an invisible question apparently apparently

1528
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:49,760
I mean in his mind I don't know if anything is cert

1529
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:50,528
.

1530
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:53,600
So maybe any statement is a quest

1531
01:27:54,368 --> 01:28:00,512
But this to me is I don't it's a bridge too far but I've really don't believe he could

1532
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:06,912
Actually think this this is now

1533
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:10,496
I know why we're here

1534
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:12,288
It's ridiculous

1535
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:13,056
Bike

1536
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:17,152
Sandy Hook no one type is not a question

1537
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:21,504
Title of my movie okay

1538
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:27,904
Colon no one. Here is the way that I guess you could argue it's a question and I think is a terrible argument that I do

1539
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:31,232
Don't agree with and I think wouldn't hold out

1540
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:33,792
You could say that you're saying this

1541
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:37,376
To evoke questions in people's mouth

1542
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:43,776
You know there's questions around this not trying to make people share

1543
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:45,824
People

1544
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,616
Don't just ask question

1545
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:49,408
You need an instigator

1546
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:52,736
Someone to say something that is I don't know

1547
01:28:54,272 --> 01:29:00,416
Potentially doable on the guy telling you to get out of the cave

1548
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:06,816
Call shadow puppets

1549
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:14,496
So when you're questioning that

1550
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,360
He's a flat

1551
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:21,920
Flag doesn't mean people don't really die

1552
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:24,480
Since 9/11

1553
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:25,248
Right

1554
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:27,552
You're saying that 9/11 was a

1555
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:28,576
Swagbucks

1556
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:29,600
Really died there

1557
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:32,416
And then

1558
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:34,720
Jay the person who you're interacting with

1559
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:37,792
You just said the shooter and victims in Orlando where Act

1560
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:41,376
And then you clarify

1561
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:43,680
Sandy Hook no one died

1562
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:45,728
911 / 3,000

1563
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:47,008
Right

1564
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:48,544
Are you know what the

1565
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:50,336
That's cuz the FBI

1566
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:53,152
If your reported

1567
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:55,456
They reported the deaths

1568
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:56,736
There was no debt

1569
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:00,832
I thought you just told me before that this

1570
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:01,856
Supposed to be a question

1571
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:07,744
This is the question you're asking

1572
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:08,768
Did anybody die scene

1573
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:12,352
And then bring up 9/11

1574
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:13,120
Three people died

1575
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:19,776
I just want make sure I understand

1576
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:21,056
Are you telling me

1577
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:22,080
That

1578
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:23,360
When you tweeted

1579
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:24,896
Sandy Hook no one died

1580
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:26,176
You were

1581
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:28,480
Asking a question about whether people

1582
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:31,296
Or you referring to an FBI report

1583
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,112
Holy question

1584
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:36,416
Okay

1585
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:38,464
So this was just you throwing a question out there

1586
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:43,840
The question out there was that what I'm supposed to take away from all the stuff he said

1587
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:45,632
Yeah I guess so because

1588
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:52,032
This is incoherent as an answer

1589
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:54,336
911 no one died at Sandy Hook

1590
01:30:54,592 --> 01:31:00,736
And so you're just asking the question did people die at Sandy Hook which is not how most people read that safe

1591
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:04,832
And then when that sort of doesn't sound like it makes a lot of sense

1592
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:10,464
He brings up the FBI report from the Adan Salazar article on Infowars

1593
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:13,792
I have that is not something that is

1594
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:17,120
Jermaine to asking questions that's ascertaining

1595
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:22,240
Definitive authoritative evident you're saying you have

1596
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:25,312
That you said was true

1597
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:31,968
No it's all convoluted and it is because he just doesn't want to own up to the fact that he was doing

1598
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:38,368
Neither would you if you're in a deposition where somebody's being sued for

1599
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:39,136
Be fine with that

1600
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:42,720
Because in Tampa dandi shoes he has nothing to lose

1601
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:45,536
Oh that's a good point he is not being sued

1602
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:50,400
That there is there is this bizarre sort of loyalty that is

1603
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:53,984
I think sincere on Gandhi's part-time Alex

1604
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:59,872
And I think that he's protecting Alex a little bit with his caginess about these answer

1605
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:01,664
Because I like

1606
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:08,064
There is just cut-and-dry evidence of what he did and what he said

1607
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:11,648
Questions in what have you when there is really no

1608
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:13,696
Cost to himself

1609
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:15,488
To just own up to

1610
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:20,608
Yes I believe those things at the time I was wrong is very dumb

1611
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:21,888
I put this out there

1612
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:25,216
And I regret it and I've apologized for it

1613
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:31,872
The only real cost is to Alex because then he'll be like why did you believe these things right now the coverage on

1614
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:36,224
Goes that direction fairly easily

1615
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:41,600
I wouldn't have done two things that he did

1616
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:47,744
I might have gotten into a fight with a cop in Elgin Elgin

1617
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:55,168
I I mean if it's this really child

1618
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:58,752
Come see the water parks

1619
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:00,800
This does

1620
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:02,592
These this whole thing

1621
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:03,616
Really

1622
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:06,944
All of the laws and depositions and stuff

1623
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:12,576
Have made me really want to scrub every last bit of my social media and anything

1624
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:13,856
Because

1625
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:17,952
Just the idea of being in a deposition and I don't even know what it would be for

1626
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:21,024
But if a lawyer starts reading a tweet I'm like

1627
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:23,840
I got it at whatever it is I confess

1628
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:30,240
Whatever you said on the podcast is bad enough

1629
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:34,592
That's some of the stuff taken out of context that

1630
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:38,944
Well Imma have to leave no evidence that either of us ever existed dad oh no sorry

1631
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:40,224
So

1632
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:44,064
Blondie went to Boston

1633
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:47,648
He want to the press conference

1634
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:51,488
Made a big splash rental Wars and talked about this a little bit

1635
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:53,536
You presented yourself as

1636
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:54,304
A journalist

1637
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,072
A member of the press

1638
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:57,376

That with the rest of the

1644
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:11,712
From the other media

1645
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:15,552
And you know what

1646
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:16,320

01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:25,024
Alright

1652
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:28,096
Governor Patrick asked

1653
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:29,376
Is there any questions

1654
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:32,448
Is that yes

1655
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:35,008
And the question you asked is

1656
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,056
Is this another false Flags

1657
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:38,336
Staged attack

Stick the hands

You don't dispute that you

1664
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,904
Ask is this another false flag staged

1665
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:52,672
Attack to take

1666
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:56,000
Nope that's what I said

1667
01:34:56,768 --> 01:34:57,792
Another

1668
01:34:59,072 --> 01:35:00,096
What was the prior

1669
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:01,632
False flag

1670
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:03,168
Staged attack you will refer

1671
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:10,080
I'm just asking if you have one in mind

1672
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:12,640
Not being drunk I'm just saying like you do with the long way

1673
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:14,432
I'm going back from the Gulf

1674

Foot doctor

1678
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:24,416
Take away your civil liberty

1679
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:26,720
Germany to go to Warwick

1680
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:29,280
And the Gulf of Tonkin wasn't used

1681
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:30,304
2 take away anybody's

1682
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:31,072
Civil liberties

1683
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:33,888
So I'm asking what was the prior

1684
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:36,192
Swag States attack

1685
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:37,984
What was the

1686
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:38,752
The prior false

1687
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:39,520
Swag stage

1688
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:40,544
Attack that you were

1689
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:42,336
911

1690
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:43,360
In Oklahoma

1691
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:44,384
In Waco

1692
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:54,368
No no absolutely not

1693
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:57,952
Of all the ones

1694
01:35:58,208 --> 01:36:01,024
That one was real I say now here

1695
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,840
Brightview

1696
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:10,240
God I love that it all I need a book and then he rattles off the same three ones that we here at

1697
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:16,640
Every single if I can time do you have a book

1698
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:17,664
Nothing to say

1699
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:18,688
Because it's like

1700
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:20,224
I have to fill up this book

1701
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:26,624
Or something I think that's what he knows the implication that I took away from it

1702
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:33,792
You got a book

1703
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:35,072
I don't know anyone

1704
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:36,864
You can write in the margins

1705
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:40,192
So goes down to Connecticut

1706
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:43,520
Looking for a soul to steal

1707
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:44,288
I am

1708
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:46,592
How big was just asking questions to

1709
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:48,384
Do you like that

1710
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:50,688
Phila people just answer his questions

1711
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:53,760
He would have stopped asking up

1712
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:55,552
The first time you were

1713
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:56,832
Recall hearing about what

1714
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:57,856
How big was

1715
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:58,624
In connection with

1716
01:36:59,136 --> 01:36:59,904
Trip to Connecticut

1717
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,464
No I mean his name is Ray

1718
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:03,744
Through the media like everybody else

1719
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:06,560
And it was every meeting match

1720
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:08,096
Especially start at

1721
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:08,864
Questions and

1722
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:10,912
The quest medium rituals

1723
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:13,472
That's not even

1724
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:15,008
Chocolate man that the time

1725
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:17,568
The first time I talked to him was the dammit

1726
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:19,872
Okay

1727
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:21,408
In your testimony

1728
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:22,944
Best you can recall is that

1729
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:24,480
Prior to that day

1730
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:27,296
Mister how big name was circulating in the media

1731
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:28,832
And you became aware

1732
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:32,416
Yes was it circulating in the main

1733
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:33,440
Remediate

1734
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:34,976
Oran

1735
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:36,512
Alternative

1736
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:38,048
Media like for example

1737
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:40,608
Call my daughter calls.

1738
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:45,216
Prior to meeting him that day

1739
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:48,032
Did you have an understanding

1740
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:49,568
That he was

1741
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:52,128
Connected in some way

1742
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:52,896
2

1743
01:37:54,688 --> 01:37:55,456
A story surrounding

1744
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:58,528
No he was out

1745
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,344
Then he gets visited by

1746
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:02,112
By the state police

1747
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:03,136
Threatened

1748
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:03,904
Danny comes out

1749
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:07,232
Questions answer the questions and I'll go away

1750
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:09,280
I don't how many times we had that on video

1751
01:38:09,536 --> 01:38:10,560
I went it was on it for what

1752
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:13,376
How many times he comes to answer my questions I'll go away

1753
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:14,912
Principal

1754
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:18,496
The most bizarre stuff

1755
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:20,288
That Witness

1756
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:22,592
The song that said this was the most bizarre

1757
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:25,408
Uncle

1758
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:26,432
Yes

1759
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:32,576
This is like

1760
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:37,952
Bizarre because I find it difficult to understand

1761
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:44,608
Or believe that batondy doesn't understand that these are fake questions

1762
01:38:44,864 --> 01:38:49,216
Have you stopped beating your spouse kind of question

1763
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:53,312
They're not designed to be answered they're designed to not be answering used as

1764
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:56,128
Evidence the people aren't answering question

1765
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:58,176
Yeah I don't

1766
01:38:58,432 --> 01:39:01,248
Know if I believe that he doesn't understand that dynamic

1767
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:07,648
But part of me is willing to believe I don't know man I feel like I've got a fairly good ear for sincere

1768
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:08,416
Charity

1769
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:11,744
And it really does feel like he thinks that he's

1770
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,792
If he gets the answers

1771
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:19,936
Then he will like how big is acting in good faith and just wants answers

1772
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:26,336
Feels like that's what we got because he does feel like that's help adande views himself also as somebody who is

1773
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:27,616
If he does get the answers

1774
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:34,016
Then he will stop you know exactly with Alex it's a very

1775
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:40,416
Obviously he has no belief that these are some to your questions that need answers this is just an

1776
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:46,048
Feel like there is a possibility that he legitimately thinks that

1777
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:47,584
If someone would just

1778
01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:51,680
I'll be up front and answer these questions we wouldn't have to go through all this

1779
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:58,080
But I don't know if that's being naive on my part 2 I mean it's hard it's hard because we're dealing with

1780
01:39:58,336 --> 01:40:00,128
Infowars people obviously

1781
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:03,200
But at the same time I really I mean it's like

1782
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:09,856
If I can't trust my ear on this one I feel I feel like I don't know if

1783
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:16,256
Willing to believe that there's a sincerity to at then other folk that I've heard but I'm not willing to commit to it

1784
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:17,792
I will say this

1785
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:22,656
Of all the people but dondi is the one closest to me saying

1786
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:23,936
He sincere

1787
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:25,216
I think

1788
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:27,264
Think that's probably true

1789
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:28,288
I mean

1790
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:34,688
Major League should heads to be fair

1791
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:35,968
Was fairly sincere

1792
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:40,064
Well yeah I mean I suppose more about everything

1793
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:44,416
Sincere in a calculated

1794
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:50,048
I'm going to be good that this it's not my fault I was very clear

1795
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:56,448
There is documented evidence that I said stop it

1796
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:58,240
Smiling in his deposition

1797
01:40:58,752 --> 01:41:01,568
Actually I watch that you was not

1798
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:07,968
Rob do sent but on d-22 Connecticut to that's why he

1799
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:09,248
Gerentes Fela soul

1800
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:15,904
And not only did batondy report on that he also gave testimony.

1801
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:17,440
The school board apparently

1802
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:19,232
This is weird Okay

1803
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:20,768
And so how did you

1804
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:22,048
How did you know

1805
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:23,328
To go

1806
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:24,608
Cover bad

1807
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:26,144
Board of Education

1808
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:29,216
Who are Infowars

1809
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:31,008
Did rod do

1810
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,544
Send you on that assignment

1811
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:34,848
They said they're going to be doing

1812
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:36,384
Things on that side

1813
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:37,408
What is the cover

1814
01:41:37,664 --> 01:41:38,176
Was going on

1815
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:40,224
And I went down there

1816
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:42,784
Did that

1817
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:44,832
Did they tell you what it was that was going to be here

1818
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:46,880
I don't I don't remember

1819
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:48,160
I mean I know it's just

1820
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:48,928
Instagram now

1821
01:41:49,184 --> 01:41:50,720
Wolfgang halbig zoby down there

1822
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:52,256
That's what I first met

1823
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:54,560
I had no clue

1824
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:58,144
School safety consultant

1825
01:41:58,656 --> 01:42:00,192
But probably I had no real knowledge

1826
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:00,960
Exactly

1827
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:03,008
Minuteman Press

1828
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:05,568
And I know that you now

1829
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:07,616
No or believe

1830
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:08,384
Becky was asked

1831
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:10,688
Did you know that

1832
01:42:11,712 --> 01:42:12,736
Prior to going to the board of ed

1833
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:16,064
What's up you were presented

1834
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:16,832
Themself

1835
01:42:27,584 --> 01:42:28,096
Unicorn

1836
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:32,960
But it was Rob dude who sent you their correct

1837
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:36,800
There's activity going on in 71st off that's why

1838
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:37,568
I know

1839
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:38,336
Went down there

1840
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:39,360
Injustice video game

1841
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:40,640
And I spoke

1842
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:42,432
Gun range

1843
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:44,480
Please don't

1844
01:42:44,736 --> 01:42:45,760
Is tragedy please don't

1845
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:47,296
Blame the Second Amendment

1846
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:48,320
For this tragedy

1847
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:51,136
Money-wise to the school board

1848
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:52,160
That's what it was about

1849
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:54,208
Obviously the board of education does it

1850
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:55,232
Have any Authority at all

1851
01:42:58,816 --> 01:43:00,352
Directions to Ironstone

1852
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:01,888
Just like me trying to make

1853
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:02,656
A

1854
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:05,472
Statement so people don't criticize are demonized

1855
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:06,496
The Second Amendment

1856
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:08,544
Because we know how a critical attitude

1857
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:09,312
These days

1858
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:12,896
And you were doing that in your capacity as a

1859
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:13,920
As a journalist

1860
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:21,344
Testimony that was on my own behalf that was not to do it didn't strike me to do that

1861
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:22,624
Better even though I did

1862
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:25,184
Citizen

1863
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:27,744
If we were in your press pass

1864
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:31,328
Oh yes several oh my God

1865
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:37,984
Yeah so it turns out the Constitution can be overridden by a school board

1866
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:40,288
I mean

1867
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:41,824
There's no reason

1868
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:47,968
To testify about how great the Second Amendment is to the school board unless you're trying to just get attention

1869
01:43:48,224 --> 01:43:50,016
Be an a******

1870
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:52,576
Distract from the issues

1871
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:58,976
It's it's really a bit it's really a strange impulse

1872
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:00,256
Thought about that

1873
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:06,400
And you know it is a strange impulse but the more I think about it the more it's like

1874
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:11,520
A different form of laziness that I wasn't aware of you know what you think about

1875
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:18,176
Everybody that you don't like being a globalist and connected to the ultimate Evil is your work

1876
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:23,040
It's got to be involved that means you don't actually have to look

1877
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:29,440
For an organization that can do anything you can just go to any government organization to be like what

1878
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:34,816
Somebody's going to hear it and let me piggyback on that the laziness ideas like

1879
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:37,376
What better place to

1880
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:41,216
Grandstand to a captive audience and like

1881
01:44:41,728 --> 01:44:46,848
School board meeting and I made a lot of people have learned that in the covid time you saw the videos that have gone

1882
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:53,248
Viral I think that it's laziness on another level like

1883
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:58,112
This will be cheap attention-grabbing and seemed like

1884
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:02,464
Kind of like relevant in bombshell

1885
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:06,304
Yeah I'm telling truth to power

1886
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:11,680
Meaning to a school board and and

1887
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:12,448
And

1888
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:19,360
I've got my minutes. I get 10 minutes to do the thing that I want to do and I have my press pass on

1889
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:25,760
But I am not here my capacity as multiple press passes on no just so you know

1890
01:45:26,016 --> 01:45:30,368
One of the things that Infowars gets a lot of leeway on

1891
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:34,208
Because of is that they are sloppy f****** organization

1892
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:40,608
And nobody knows what's going on left hand doesn't know what the right hands doing it's all a mess it really doesn't feel like there

1893
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:41,376
Already hands

1894
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:42,400
Well

1895
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:45,984
We know that Rob Doucette baton Dave there

1896
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:51,872
So there's one element of coordination that is editorial planning in some ways

1897
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:58,272
This next clip reveals that there is maybe a bit more micromanaging than Isleta

1898
01:45:58,528 --> 01:45:59,040
No no

1899
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:00,832
Email you sent him

1900
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:02,880
Day earlier

1901
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:05,952
Add subject Don dmos

And you were

1905
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:12,352
Running by him

1906
01:46:13,376 --> 01:46:14,144
Questions you

1907
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:15,168

Sparta to man on this

1909
01:46:21,056 --> 01:46:21,568
Yes

1910
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:24,384
One of those man on this

1911
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,152
Street

1912
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:26,432
Segments

1913
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:27,712
Concerned

1914
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:30,016
Questions about

1915
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:31,040
School drills

1916
01:46:31,296 --> 01:46:31,808
Stripe

1917
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:33,856
Any other can

1918
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:34,624
Concern

1919
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:36,416
Town hall and conventions

1920
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:38,464
Right

1921
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:50,240
A series of drills and one was that

1922
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:51,776
Immaculata

1923
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:53,312
Out of school

1924
01:46:55,616 --> 01:46:56,128
The witness

1925
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:57,152
From the Press Box

1926
01:46:59,968 --> 01:47:01,248
Abject

1927
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:02,272
2

1928
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:03,552
Schools

1929
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:04,320
Or

1930
01:47:05,088 --> 01:47:05,856
Other public

1931
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:08,672
Safety drills

1932
01:47:09,696 --> 01:47:11,232
Got abjection. By all means

1933
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:12,512
Cuz I think it's very important

1934
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:13,280
14

1935
01:47:13,792 --> 01:47:15,328
Officially

1936
01:47:15,584 --> 01:47:16,352
Fire officials

1937
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:20,448
Cuz I was part of Joe's before

1938
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:22,752
I mean like when I work at the airport we did

1939
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:25,312
Why do drills like a plane crash I would lay there with a

1940
01:47:25,568 --> 01:47:27,104
Tagamet to tell Liam he

1941
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:29,920
And I think he's writing for

1942
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:32,736
Prep the people for

1943
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:36,064
Happened

1944
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:37,344
So I don't

1945
01:47:38,624 --> 01:47:39,904
Botwin

1946
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:42,208
Open to Intermezzo drill

1947
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:44,256
Something similar happened not every time

1948
01:47:45,792 --> 01:47:48,096
When is a drill frequently something

1949
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:50,912
Ashley Mario

1950
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:53,216
No coincidence I don't know

1951
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:54,752
Napa

1952
01:47:57,568 --> 01:47:58,336
Autograph

1953
01:48:00,128 --> 01:48:00,640
Although

1954
01:48:01,152 --> 01:48:01,920
In certain situations

1955
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:02,688
Boston

1956
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:03,456
Marathon bomber

1957
01:48:04,736 --> 01:48:05,248
It was

1958
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:06,784
Yes

1959
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,088
In the Mist

1960
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:10,112
Do response

1961
01:48:10,368 --> 01:48:10,880

Very good

1963
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:14,464
Also add

1964
01:48:16,512 --> 01:48:17,024
And then he proposed

1965
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:18,304
Additional Quest

1966
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:19,840
Free to ask about the SEC

1967
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:27,520
So there is running questions by Rob do approval

1968
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:29,568
You adding more questions and

1969
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:31,616
That is

1970
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:37,248
A level of intent a level of organization centralization of content

1971
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:43,648
Obviously I don't think it goes to the extent of like everything is checked off and approved

1972
01:48:43,904 --> 01:48:48,512
You know they're not that rigorous but there is

1973
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:52,096
More of that than they like to pretend

1974
01:48:52,352 --> 01:48:58,496
It's all shooting from the hip and whatever happens happens for Alex doesn't have a teleprompter but he has producers in his ears

1975
01:48:58,752 --> 01:48:59,776
Feeding himself and telling them

1976
01:49:00,032 --> 01:49:06,176
Things to say and information nobody plans anything but oh there's emails where you're going over

1977
01:49:06,432 --> 01:49:08,224
Uber in advance man-on-the-street question

1978
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:10,528
That the Kraken is going to ask people right

1979
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:15,648
No there is there is more going on here than that is makes

1980
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:19,232
The whole institution of the organization more culpable

1981
01:49:19,488 --> 01:49:23,840
Then they like to believe we're like to put on I mean it's unreasonable to think that

1982
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:29,984
They can grow into what amounts do I don't know half a billion dollars a year business

1983
01:49:30,496 --> 01:49:31,776
Without

1984
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:33,824
Any kind of that like

1985
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:40,224
It's pure improv the whole thing we ever make that calculated I don't they want you to believe is

1986
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:46,624
Like the content side effects after shooting from the hip and then the business I don't even deal with any of that stuff

1987
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:49,184
Another winning

1988
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:53,280
Right and it's just delusional it's it's a fiction

1989
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:55,840
So Wolfgang halbig had an issue

1990
01:49:56,352 --> 01:49:57,632
With the police

1991
01:49:57,888 --> 01:49:59,168
Started

1992
01:49:59,424 --> 01:50:03,520
He was asking questions about Sandy Hook in the police done came to him and say to you cut it out

1993
01:50:04,032 --> 01:50:06,592
You will not be asking these questions interesting

1994
01:50:06,848 --> 01:50:10,176
Island Brandy heard that story and then was like oh yeah definitely true

1995
01:50:10,688 --> 01:50:11,968
Let me see how big told you that

1996
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:13,248
Connecticut state trooper

1997
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:14,272
Merced come to his

1998
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:15,808
Yes

1999
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:22,976
Go shooting

2000
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:27,072
America

2001
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:32,192
You know what the

2002
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:33,472
Don't understand

2003
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:35,264
Police officers

2004
01:50:36,544 --> 01:50:37,056
Guess what

2005
01:50:40,896 --> 01:50:44,224
Did you just hear him say that the school board members had sent police office

2006
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:46,784
Yeah

2007
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:48,576
In-N-Out

2008
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:52,160
Did did you do anything to confirm whether or not the

2009
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:52,928
School Board

2010
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:54,464
Edison police officers

2011
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:56,256
Settings

2012
01:50:56,512 --> 01:50:59,072
It's always I mean obviously I couldn't

2013
01:51:01,632 --> 01:51:05,216
Nashville proof or anything like that even I could cuz he's

2014
01:51:05,472 --> 01:51:05,984
School Board

2015
01:51:07,008 --> 01:51:07,776
No we went to

2016
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:08,544
School Board

2017
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:09,312
Whatever was

2018
01:51:10,848 --> 01:51:11,616
Yeah show me directions

2019
01:51:11,872 --> 01:51:12,384
The school board

2020
01:51:14,944 --> 01:51:15,456
No I know but

2021
01:51:15,712 --> 01:51:16,224
If the school

2022
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:17,248
Portage police officer

2023
01:51:18,528 --> 01:51:19,296
Did you think to ask

2024
01:51:19,552 --> 01:51:21,088
School board members who were there but that was

2025
01:51:22,368 --> 01:51:24,416
I don't want this was I don't

2026
01:51:24,672 --> 01:51:25,184
Laughter

2027
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:26,720
The testimony

2028
01:51:26,976 --> 01:51:27,488
I don't know

2029
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:30,048
That didn't occur to you that was your

2030
01:51:31,584 --> 01:51:32,096
No

2031
01:51:33,632 --> 01:51:34,400
January

2032
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:36,960
Infowars press badge

2033
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:45,152
So when you get journalism training from you're not Uncle PR guy is he's not a journalist sometimes you hear claims

2034
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:45,920
Seems like

2035
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:49,760
The school board sent the police to harass me

2036
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:56,160
And you don't think follow-up questions or like corroborating information right is important cuz like

2037
01:51:56,416 --> 01:52:00,512
If you believe the story why wouldn't you ask the school board and like

2038
01:52:00,768 --> 01:52:02,816
Is there comment on it

2039
01:52:04,096 --> 01:52:05,376
It's ridiculous

2040
01:52:05,632 --> 01:52:08,448
You don't scratch this cuz you're not curious

2041
01:52:08,704 --> 01:52:09,728
And you probably don't

2042
01:52:09,984 --> 01:52:12,544
Woman on baby subconsciously or consciously

2043
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:18,176
Don't want to run the risk of having probable cause to think of the person you're talking to the liar

2044
01:52:18,432 --> 01:52:18,944
Yeah

2045
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:19,712
It's safer

2046
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:26,368
As far as the cover-your-ass goes it feels like the jondy is wearing those comical long

2047
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:27,648
We're with the butt flap

2048
01:52:27,904 --> 01:52:34,048
Wide-open just out in the cold tundra mean while trying to cover other

2049
01:52:34,304 --> 01:52:35,328
People's acid weirdly

2050
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:40,192
Covering for how big covering for Alex

2051
01:52:40,704 --> 01:52:41,472
That's weird

2052
01:52:41,728 --> 01:52:42,240
Yeah

2053
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:43,776
So it was reported

2054
01:52:44,544 --> 01:52:46,848
When batondy and how they came to town

2055
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:50,432
In Connecticut that the circus was coming to town

2056
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:51,712
Now

2057
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:54,528
You'll never believe what reporting this was based on

2058
01:52:55,296 --> 01:52:56,064
Why having a parent

2059
01:52:59,904 --> 01:53:00,672
Target

2060
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:09,632
Mr. E

2061
01:53:09,888 --> 01:53:10,400
Am I correct

2062
01:53:10,912 --> 01:53:11,424
You said that

2063
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:12,704
It was reported

2064
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:14,240
Betty big circus

2065
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:15,008
Christmas coming to town

2066
01:53:16,032 --> 01:53:16,800
And that we're all bunch of

2067
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:19,616
When we got there

2068
01:53:19,872 --> 01:53:21,408
Am I mind my business

2069
01:53:21,664 --> 01:53:22,176
Some jackass

2070
01:53:22,432 --> 01:53:24,992
The circus is in town we don't want

2071
01:53:25,504 --> 01:53:26,272
It was reported

2072
01:53:26,528 --> 01:53:27,552
Your aunt know that you bring

2073
01:53:27,808 --> 01:53:29,856
Instructions to Tottenham explain to these guys

2074
01:53:30,112 --> 01:53:31,392
I'm here just cover

2075
01:53:31,904 --> 01:53:33,952
I'm still learning what's going on

2076
01:53:34,464 --> 01:53:35,744
What does empower

2077
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:38,560
And they were actually giving Wolfgang a real heart

2078
01:53:39,072 --> 01:53:42,400
Kevin and

2079
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:43,680
The other people

2080
01:53:44,704 --> 01:53:45,216
Corner so big

2081
01:53:48,544 --> 01:53:50,848
I mean like seriously I do my job

2082
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:52,128
Piss off

2083
01:53:53,664 --> 01:53:55,712
It's just irritating Wolfgang's right now

2084
01:53:58,784 --> 01:53:59,552
I predict

2085
01:54:00,064 --> 01:54:01,856
Yeah I just wanted to

2086
01:54:02,624 --> 01:54:04,160
You answer my question I was curious

2087
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:06,720
Where that reference came from it sounds like

2088
01:54:06,976 --> 01:54:08,512
Are bystanders

2089
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:09,792
Stop

2090
01:54:10,304 --> 01:54:11,072
Made a comment to you that

2091
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:15,168
Yes

2092
01:54:15,936 --> 01:54:16,704
It reported

2093
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:17,472
Listen

2094
01:54:17,728 --> 01:54:19,008
New York Times

2095
01:54:19,264 --> 01:54:20,800
Some a****** of the street

2096
01:54:21,056 --> 01:54:27,200
What's the difference Brook porting is reporting

2097
01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:28,224
Fishes

2098
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:34,624
Unfair if you say the word on the street was literally

2099
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:42,304
Just some random person I mean this is just an extension of you like random tweet equals all the left

2100
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:45,888
Believe this thing

2101
01:54:46,144 --> 01:54:49,984
And elevating whatever random thing is is useful

2102
01:54:50,496 --> 01:54:51,520
Very sad

2103
01:54:52,288 --> 01:54:58,432
So we know that the the state troopers were the ones that came and harassed Wolfgang

2104
01:54:58,944 --> 01:54:59,712
Bye

2105
01:54:59,968 --> 01:55:03,296
Maybe it's story isn't very consistent even within the clip

2106
01:55:03,552 --> 01:55:06,624
That he is oh my God

2107
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:15,072
How old is Cher

2108
01:55:16,096 --> 01:55:16,608
Florida

2109
01:55:19,168 --> 01:55:20,192
Definition Eros

2110
01:55:22,496 --> 01:55:25,056
And if I ever come to Newtown I mean

2111
01:55:28,384 --> 01:55:30,432
Mister Kyle big preferred

2112
01:55:30,944 --> 01:55:31,968
Not just Connecticut state

2113
01:55:32,224 --> 01:55:33,504
Troopers but deputy sheriff's

2114
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:34,528
Florida is having going

2115
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:36,832
Did he describe

2116
01:55:37,344 --> 01:55:37,856
Two different

2117
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:40,160
One in which Connecticut state

2118
01:55:40,928 --> 01:55:41,952
His house in one in which

2119
01:55:42,464 --> 01:55:43,744
Florida deputy sheriff's

2120
01:55:44,768 --> 01:55:45,280
I can't make

2121
01:55:49,632 --> 01:55:50,656
That's what I was asking though

2122
01:55:50,912 --> 01:55:52,704
Earlier you stated that he told you that Connecticut

2123
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:56,544
What's up

2124
01:55:57,312 --> 01:55:57,824
You said that

2125
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:07,808
Lorraine Franco

2126
01:56:10,112 --> 01:56:11,136
What

2127
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:12,928
Bananas

2128
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:17,536
My questions are aggravating

2129
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:19,584
No not you another

2130
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:21,376
Questions just the whole Factory General

2131
01:56:22,912 --> 01:56:23,936
Your what

2132
01:56:24,448 --> 01:56:24,960
Soon

2133
01:56:25,216 --> 01:56:25,728
The gun

2134
01:56:25,984 --> 01:56:27,520
Tsunami

2135
01:56:28,032 --> 01:56:34,176
People some now but don't be getting himself a little bit mad man the

2136
01:56:34,432 --> 01:56:40,576
Gates have become open and it's weird that the floodgates opened because he stopped himself from saying something

2137
01:56:40,832 --> 01:56:46,976
As opposed to this entire time where he is just rambled

2138
01:56:47,232 --> 01:56:53,376
That he's violated his own First Amendment rights and that's making him everything that he's fought at

2139
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:54,912
Against his entire life

2140
01:56:55,168 --> 01:56:56,960
Dnce

2141
01:56:57,984 --> 01:57:03,360
Subconsciously if I had to guess, I would say that he's being confronted with this information that

2142
01:57:03,616 --> 01:57:06,688
Clearly indicate that he should have seen through Wolfgang s***

2143
01:57:06,944 --> 01:57:13,088
A lot earlier baby immediately in the present having a conversation with him maybe all this is bulshit

2144
01:57:14,368 --> 01:57:14,880
And

2145
01:57:15,136 --> 01:57:18,720
That probably doesn't feel good and so in order to sort of deflect from that

2146
01:57:22,048 --> 01:57:28,192
I'm just starts ranting and spoiler alert seems to be calling the parents of murdered children Howard is now

2147
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:29,728
Things are aggravating

2148
01:57:30,496 --> 01:57:31,776
No not you another question

2149
01:57:32,032 --> 01:57:33,568
It's just the whole Factory General that

2150
01:57:35,104 --> 01:57:36,128
Your what

2151

That's the first amendments that people need to understand that and start respect

2188
01:59:00,096 --> 01:59:01,632

And I'm getting

2196
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:22,112
Stupid questions have nothing to do at all with Sandy Hook

2197
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:24,672
The try to pay me as some kind of knuckle

01:59:56,672 --> 01:59:58,720
The Second Amendment why would you

2211
01:59:58,976 --> 02:00:00,256
Were you referring to the

2212
02:00:00,768 --> 02:00:01,536
20 tips in this

2213
02:00:01,792 --> 02:00:02,304
This case

2214
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:06,656
I just listened to you for awhile

2215
02:00:08,704 --> 02:00:09,472
But I would ask

2216
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:11,008
Trials in my question

2217
02:00:11,264 --> 02:00:11,776

We got the planet

02:00:18,688 --> 02:00:19,200
In this case

2223
02:00:19,968 --> 02:00:20,736
I in the case again

2224
02:00:21,248 --> 02:00:21,760
Remington Arms

2225
02:00:22,016 --> 02:00:22,528
Work hours

2226
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:23,552
Is that what you said

2227
02:00:24,576 --> 02:00:25,344
Anybody

2228
02:00:26,624 --> 02:00:28,416
The Second Amendment yes you're okay

2229
02:00:33,792 --> 02:00:34,816
What are protected those choke

2230
02:00:35,328 --> 02:00:36,608
Bottom line enough is enough

2231
02:00:37,632 --> 02:00:39,168
Enough is enough of this b*******

2232
02:00:41,216 --> 02:00:43,008
Yeah this this so

2233
02:00:43,264 --> 02:00:45,568
Wasn't a victory for Infowars I don't think

2234
02:00:45,824 --> 02:00:47,872
Maybe the messaging wasn't quite on point

2235
02:00:48,128 --> 02:00:52,992
Maybe exactly where you'd want it to be I can see where the conflict with the cops

2236
02:00:53,504 --> 02:00:59,648
And Elgin happen I respect you

2237
02:00:59,904 --> 02:01:05,536
No we'll be forgetting you what's wrong with all of you sue happy people no beef against

2238
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:11,936
This is total b******* and a waste of my f****** time enough of this nonsense now I love you you're great you're the best

2239
02:01:12,192 --> 02:01:18,336
The best lawyer who is destroying the Second Amendment

2240
02:01:19,616 --> 02:01:25,760
He brought up something that's such a good point in such a f***** up part of of the human brain

2241
02:01:26,016 --> 02:01:28,832
Rain and everything we.

2242
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:34,976
With the armed guard at his kids school he feels safer

2243
02:01:35,488 --> 02:01:40,864
When you when you hear what the actual way to become safer is you know improving communities

2244
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:46,752
Distributing wealth in places that needed all of those kind of things fairly abstract

2245
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:48,288
Feel safe

2246
02:01:48,544 --> 02:01:52,128
Obviously putting an armed guard makes you less safe

2247
02:01:52,384 --> 02:01:53,152
But it's

2248
02:01:53,408 --> 02:01:59,552
Feels safer and such a f*****-up way our brains work something with like

2249
02:01:59,808 --> 02:02:05,952
In countries like the everyone has nukes we're all safer

2250
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:06,720
Intuitive

2251
02:02:06,976 --> 02:02:10,304
I don't know what maybe it's maybe it's some part of our Evolution you don't like

2252
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:13,888
At a time I don't want being armed at 6 right

2253
02:02:14,144 --> 02:02:17,472
I don't trust any

2254
02:02:17,728 --> 02:02:23,872
Sticking close to me why did we leave stick and Club days is the biggest question of all

2255
02:02:25,664 --> 02:02:31,808
Wistful photos for those days

2256
02:02:32,832 --> 02:02:34,368
And you consider this to be a waste of your

2257
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:35,392
Right

2258
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:36,672
It is waste

2259
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:39,744
Because of which this about what is this about

2260
02:02:41,024 --> 02:02:43,072
Why am I here why am I because I was there

2261
02:02:43,584 --> 02:02:44,352
As a reporter

2262
02:02:44,608 --> 02:02:45,120
Protected

2263
02:02:45,376 --> 02:02:45,888
Stupid

2264
02:02:46,144 --> 02:02:48,192
Under the First Amendment if nobody wakes

2265
02:02:48,448 --> 02:02:49,216
Straight to Hell

2266
02:02:49,984 --> 02:02:52,288
It might not be put on Wreck-It I don't call with anybody

2267
02:02:52,544 --> 02:02:53,568
My only governor

2268
02:02:53,824 --> 02:02:55,104
My only God is Jesus

2269
02:02:56,128 --> 02:02:59,712
Why do you care about the amendments

2270
02:02:59,968 --> 02:03:02,016
Jesus Christ

2271
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:08,160
And I protected by the First Amendment

2272
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:10,720
And I'm at the fender of the 2nd

2273
02:03:11,488 --> 02:03:13,536
And the thing is

2274
02:03:13,792 --> 02:03:14,560
The two things of being tired

2275
02:03:16,352 --> 02:03:17,376
Okay is the First Amendment

2276
02:03:18,144 --> 02:03:20,192
In the Free Speech

2277
02:03:21,728 --> 02:03:22,496
Because we're not

2278
02:03:22,752 --> 02:03:23,520
Establishment media

2279
02:03:23,776 --> 02:03:25,312
And also the second of his being

2280
02:03:27,104 --> 02:03:27,616
Why would

2281
02:03:27,872 --> 02:03:29,664
Remington

2282
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:30,432
Diculous

2283
02:03:30,944 --> 02:03:31,712
Against

2284
02:03:31,968 --> 02:03:32,992
I grieve

2285
02:03:33,504 --> 02:03:36,576
Peritonitis

2286
02:03:36,832 --> 02:03:38,112
Ensign

2287
02:03:38,368 --> 02:03:39,648
Yeah even though you said that it

2288
02:03:39,904 --> 02:03:40,416
It was fake right

2289
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:42,208
No I didn't I

2290
02:03:43,232 --> 02:03:45,280
So you never said you never said that ain't nothing to do

2291
02:03:45,536 --> 02:03:46,048
Never said that

2292
02:03:47,584 --> 02:03:50,144
When I was thinking about was looking at yours

2293
02:03:50,656 --> 02:03:56,800
Did you ever say

2294
02:03:57,824 --> 02:03:58,592
You're making me miss

2295
02:04:00,128 --> 02:04:00,640
Sandy Hook

2296
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:02,432
My questions

2297
02:04:02,944 --> 02:04:03,456
Question

2298
02:04:03,712 --> 02:04:08,064
That's that's about as close as we're going to get to Timmy doing

2299
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:14,464
What is your job what is your child is getting a little abusive

2300
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:20,864
Baby Maddie is just sort of letting a little bit of like I'm going to be blunt now

2301
02:04:21,376 --> 02:04:27,520
Did you say this about like if he's only answers to

2302
02:04:27,776 --> 02:04:31,360
God ways to care about the Constitution and the amendment right it's because

2303
02:04:31,616 --> 02:04:37,504
The understanding that someone like him has and a lot of the militia Patriot hard-right communities

2304
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:41,088
Is that you know it is all just

2305
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:42,112
God

2306
02:04:42,624 --> 02:04:45,696
I've either way the Bill of Rights is like

2307
02:04:45,952 --> 02:04:46,464
Divine

2308
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:49,024
In some nature and then

2309
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:55,424
All of it is it it's not a delineation of rights that you have because of the Constitution

2310
02:04:55,680 --> 02:05:01,824
The government can't do to you you have those rights with or without the Constitution because of divine right

2311
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:03,872
God gave you those right

2312
02:05:04,128 --> 02:05:10,272
Right that's partially why they are there against communism because it seeks to destroy God and those rights would

2313
02:05:10,528 --> 02:05:11,040
Go away

2314
02:05:11,296 --> 02:05:14,880
It's not contradictory in the way that maybe you were think

2315
02:05:15,392 --> 02:05:21,536
I mean either way it's it's still worshipping a golden calf at the end of the day so

2316
02:05:21,792 --> 02:05:27,936
Degree inasmuch as like if you believe that these are god-given rights than the government not right

2317
02:05:28,192 --> 02:05:30,240
Respecting them can't take them away from you either

2318
02:05:30,496 --> 02:05:33,824
It just puts you in a different situation where you have a hostile government

2319
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:34,592
It's like

2320
02:05:34,848 --> 02:05:35,360
I mean

2321
02:05:35,616 --> 02:05:38,176
Would you already understand that like

2322
02:05:38,688 --> 02:05:41,504
100 people voted on the Constitution

2323
02:05:42,016 --> 02:05:44,320
A tale it wasn't it wasn't like

2324
02:05:45,088 --> 02:05:45,856
Voted on

2325
02:05:46,112 --> 02:05:52,256
It was the government and writing a constitution that the couple of them were mules literally literally

2326
02:05:52,512 --> 02:05:58,656
Different types of animals

2327
02:05:59,936 --> 02:06:06,080
So I will say that I think that Maddie is really actually being pretty effective in getting batondy mad just asking

2328
02:06:06,336 --> 02:06:08,896
Bread questions and not not letting up I like it

2329
02:06:09,664 --> 02:06:10,176
Did you

2330
02:06:10,432 --> 02:06:10,944
Say

2331
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:12,224
Sandy Hook was a hoax

2332
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:12,992
Yes or no

2333
02:06:14,528 --> 02:06:18,368
Okay but if you did I'm sure you were grieving your heart out for those

2334
02:06:18,624 --> 02:06:19,392
Families when you said it

2335
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:21,184
Objection

2336
02:06:22,976 --> 02:06:24,000
Alright mr. Madonna

2337
02:06:26,048 --> 02:06:26,816
What the hell is gun rights

2338
02:06:27,072 --> 02:06:28,352
Why we talking

2339
02:06:28,608 --> 02:06:29,120
Second Amendment

2340
02:06:31,936 --> 02:06:33,216
This is not case against Remington

2341
02:06:34,752 --> 02:06:36,032
It's all part of the same Damned

2342
02:06:37,824 --> 02:06:38,336
Get off this

2343
02:06:38,592 --> 02:06:39,104
It's okay

2344
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:41,152
It's part of tack in the front

2345
02:06:41,408 --> 02:06:43,200
This whole thing is about

2346
02:06:43,456 --> 02:06:45,504
Probably doing money

2347
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:47,040
It's about talking first

2348
02:06:47,296 --> 02:06:49,088
Dearly people

2349
02:06:50,112 --> 02:06:50,624
These children

2350
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:52,160
Makes me sick to my damn

2351
02:06:53,184 --> 02:06:53,696
Really simple

2352
02:06:54,208 --> 02:06:57,024
And I'll get anybody out there anybody

2353
02:06:57,280 --> 02:06:58,560
That and you can attack us

2354
02:06:59,072 --> 02:06:59,584
Intrust Amendment

2355
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:00,352
The very

2356
02:07:00,608 --> 02:07:01,888
America

2357
02:07:02,912 --> 02:07:03,936
Makes me sick to my games

2358
02:07:06,752 --> 02:07:11,360
These people need to realize we had not gone right that we are not submitting a substance in the world

2359
02:07:11,616 --> 02:07:15,200
Straight to Hell playing the temple we are not going to give up outrage

2360
02:07:15,456 --> 02:07:16,992
Because people want to do everything

2361
02:07:17,248 --> 02:07:20,320
I want to protect my children never choose in the future

2362
02:07:20,576 --> 02:07:22,112
Country

2363
02:07:22,368 --> 02:07:23,136
The ever happen again

2364
02:07:23,392 --> 02:07:25,696
Had to do that we need to arm the school's not the summer

2365
02:07:25,952 --> 02:07:27,488
We need to protect our children with

2366
02:07:27,744 --> 02:07:28,256
The Second Amendment

2367
02:07:28,768 --> 02:07:32,352
Israel did a 1974 only to school shootings attempted happen

2368
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:34,912
Ottumwa

2369
02:07:35,424 --> 02:07:38,240
Are you wanting Emily so much and what it is real neon ball the school

2370
02:07:39,008 --> 02:07:39,776
And Young

2371
02:07:40,032 --> 02:07:42,592
Sandy Hook gun free zones do you wonder why

2372
02:07:42,848 --> 02:07:43,872
100 lb

2373
02:07:46,176 --> 02:07:47,456
Nobody would have done.

2374
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:49,248
You want me to come on

2375
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:53,088
I thought mistaken

2376
02:07:59,744 --> 02:08:01,024
Are you ready to move on

2377
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:07,424
There is an interest

2378
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:13,824
Sing I think maybe intentional strategy that Maddie is employing and that is letting him talk because but he does

2379
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:15,360
Seem to be someone who

2380
02:08:15,872 --> 02:08:19,968
Whether it's that sincerity or there's a lack of guardedness

2381
02:08:20,224 --> 02:08:23,296
That a lot of these other folks who have been deposed have

2382
02:08:23,552 --> 02:08:28,160
There is a decent chance that he will just start talking and accidentally say some s*** that

2383
02:08:28,416 --> 02:08:30,208
What are you saying

2384
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:32,768
He already is giving up like

2385
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:37,120
This operation cover-your-ass stuff to the internal workings

2386
02:08:37,376 --> 02:08:38,400
I like

2387
02:08:38,656 --> 02:08:42,240
The the earpiece and the way that they Coach Alex or like

2388
02:08:42,496 --> 02:08:45,312
Feed him information the fact that there is

2389
02:08:45,824 --> 02:08:50,432
Like editorial conversations about what questions to ask a man on the street

2390
02:08:50,944 --> 02:08:55,040
Like he's already bit like that I feel like there's more information

2391
02:08:55,296 --> 02:08:56,576
It is accidentally come out

2392
02:08:56,832 --> 02:09:01,440
Because of him talk to the pile him calling parrots cowards

2393
02:09:01,696 --> 02:09:02,464
Yeah that was

2394
02:09:02,976 --> 02:09:05,280
How dare anyone defend them

2395
02:09:05,792 --> 02:09:06,304
While

2396
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:07,072
Yeah

2397
02:09:07,584 --> 02:09:11,936
Wild I think that you gained a lot just by letting him

2398
02:09:12,192 --> 02:09:12,704
Go

2399
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:16,544
But unfortunately that doesn't leave very long deposition

2400
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:22,944
Yeah I didn't repetition interrogators like a talker and also hate it.

2401
02:09:23,456 --> 02:09:24,480
More than anything else

2402
02:09:24,736 --> 02:09:28,576
Yeah I feel for an end this is what I think is an amazing

2403
02:09:28,832 --> 02:09:32,928
Tang and I think we should all be more grateful towards stenographers

2404
02:09:33,696 --> 02:09:34,208
How

2405
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:36,256
Can you hear all of that

2406
02:09:36,512 --> 02:09:42,656
Let It Go through your brain through your fingers to the type of machine well actually losing your f****** mind

2407
02:09:42,912 --> 02:09:49,056
Let me save this as having difficulty with the

2408
02:09:49,312 --> 02:09:53,152
Are you stalking and so they they did have a conversation about this

2409
02:09:53,664 --> 02:09:59,808
That she would get a copy of it I wish I could do it get a clean transcript later

2410
02:10:00,064 --> 02:10:05,952
This might not be such a situation like I need a break

2411
02:10:06,208 --> 02:10:10,816
She probably not catching everything

2412
02:10:11,328 --> 02:10:13,120
So this next clip

2413
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:19,520
I know I don't know what I can describe this is playing who's on first about a tweet

2414
02:10:19,776 --> 02:10:22,336
Grape is so frustrating

2415
02:10:22,592 --> 02:10:24,128
In October

2416
02:10:24,384 --> 02:10:24,896

2417
02:10:25,408 --> 02:10:26,688
Was it your view

2418
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:28,480
That Sandy Hook was a hoax

2419
02:10:29,248 --> 02:10:30,016
Auto Club

2420
02:10:30,272 --> 02:10:30,784
Why don't

2421
02:10:32,064 --> 02:10:33,344
Long time ago I have no clue

2422
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:41,280
Showing you exhibit number 12

2423
02:10:43,328 --> 02:10:44,096

2426

Then there's a URL

2437
02:11:06,112 --> 02:11:06,624
Shocking

2438
02:11:07,136 --> 02:11:08,928
Sandy Hook now revealed as a hoax

2439
02:11:09,696 --> 02:11:10,208

02:11:17,888 --> 02:11:18,656
And did you

2444
02:11:19,168 --> 02:11:20,192
When you tweeted them

2445
02:11:20,448 --> 02:11:20,960

Let me finish.

2452
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:39,136

2467
02:12:13,952 --> 02:12:16,000

Arrest this man

Infuriated I appreciate that honestly I actually appreciate this

2500
02:13:36,128 --> 02:13:39,456
Mainly because it calibrates my sincerity ear

2501
02:13:39,712 --> 02:13:45,856
And when I'm going to think he was being sincere earlier I think I think it's very clear when he's not being sincere

2502
02:13:46,112 --> 02:13:46,624
Here at least

2503
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:48,416

2524
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:55,744

Do this is defendant

2529
02:15:06,496 --> 02:15:07,776
I'm here on my own behalf

2530
02:15:08,032 --> 02:15:09,824

2531
02:15:10,336 --> 02:15:12,128

You guys now

2538
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:31,584
None of my business

2539
02:15:32,096 --> 02:15:33,632
A reporter

2540
02:15:34,144 --> 02:15:34,656

Okay that's my statement that's my

02:15:42,336 --> 02:15:44,640

2546
02:15:44,896 --> 02:15:46,176
Nobody's tonight

02:15:46,688 --> 02:15:48,992

Are you doing

2551
02:15:56,160 --> 02:15:56,928
Ask my next question

2552
02:16:12,544 --> 02:16:15,616
I'm going to need a small time out for bathroom break it

2553
02:16:15,872 --> 02:16:17,152

2554
02:16:17,664 --> 02:16:23,552

02:16:45,568 --> 02:16:51,712
Yeah the robot alien

2560
02:16:51,968 --> 02:16:58,112
How is it that you're not mad at me

2561
02:16:58,368 --> 02:17:04,512
Box out of you and you're just on your on your focus

2562
02:17:04,768 --> 02:17:10,912
Tim going on here are you if I understood what you were doing no disrespect

2563
02:17:11,424 --> 02:17:12,960
So we get another tweet

2564
02:17:13,216 --> 02:17:14,496
Being discussed here

2565
02:17:17,824 --> 02:17:18,848
Tweeted that on August 20th

2566
02:17:19,872 --> 02:17:20,384
Incorrect

2567
02:17:22,432 --> 02:17:23,968
And you type the words

2568
02:17:24,480 --> 02:17:24,992
Sandy Hook

2569
02:17:25,248 --> 02:17:26,016
Was staged actors

2570
02:17:30,112 --> 02:17:30,624
And

2571
02:17:31,392 --> 02:17:32,416
Is that because

2572
02:17:33,184 --> 02:17:33,952
As of the time you sent

2573
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:37,024
That was in fact

2574
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:38,560
What you believe that Sandy Hook was

2575
02:17:38,816 --> 02:17:39,328
Was staged

2576
02:17:39,584 --> 02:17:40,096
Good actors

2577
02:17:40,864 --> 02:17:42,656
That I've been planning that a lot of question

2578
02:17:45,984 --> 02:17:47,264
Both ends mean

2579
02:17:47,776 --> 02:17:48,800
Nyan Nyan

2580
02:17:49,056 --> 02:17:49,568
And apologize

2581
02:17:51,616 --> 02:17:53,408
I'm just asking you whether or not it

2582
02:17:53,664 --> 02:17:54,176
The time you sent this

2583
02:17:54,432 --> 02:17:54,944
Tweet

2584
02:17:55,456 --> 02:17:55,968
I do

2585
02:18:00,320 --> 02:18:01,856
So you allow for the possibility

2586
02:18:02,112 --> 02:18:03,392
That you may have typed

2587
02:18:03,904 --> 02:18:04,416
Sandy Hook

2588
02:18:04,672 --> 02:18:05,440
Stage actor

2589
02:18:05,952 --> 02:18:06,464
!

2590
02:18:06,976 --> 02:18:07,488
Without actually

2591
02:18:07,744 --> 02:18:08,256
Believing

2592
02:18:10,304 --> 02:18:11,072
I'm not sure

2593
02:18:13,376 --> 02:18:14,144
It could be it might not be

2594
02:18:15,936 --> 02:18:17,216
I don't remember what

2595
02:18:17,728 --> 02:18:18,240
Bobby Knight

2596
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:20,032
Well I'm just

2597
02:18:21,056 --> 02:18:21,824
You typed it so

2598
02:18:22,592 --> 02:18:23,104
If

2599
02:18:23,360 --> 02:18:24,384
If

2600
02:18:24,896 --> 02:18:26,176
State-backed

2601
02:18:26,944 --> 02:18:29,504
Would it be reasonable to assume that that's what you in fact believe

2602
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:32,832
McDonald's

2603
02:18:33,344 --> 02:18:34,112
I am

2604
02:18:34,368 --> 02:18:35,904
You may be right I'm just trying to

2605
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:37,440
You know I don't miss

2606
02:18:37,696 --> 02:18:38,464
Sparring with me

2607
02:18:38,720 --> 02:18:39,232
Instead of

2608
02:18:39,488 --> 02:18:40,000
Just telling me

2609
02:18:40,256 --> 02:18:41,536
Whether you believe that

2610
02:18:42,304 --> 02:18:43,072
That's all

2611
02:18:44,864 --> 02:18:45,888
Okay whatever

2612
02:18:46,912 --> 02:18:48,448
Change my to

2613
02:18:54,336 --> 02:18:55,616
That's totally fair II

2614
02:18:57,152 --> 02:18:59,968
That's all I want to know in in so I'm just running it

2615
02:19:00,224 --> 02:19:01,504
Make sure I understand that

2616
02:19:02,016 --> 02:19:02,784
After the time

2617
02:19:03,296 --> 02:19:04,832
Although you may have later chain

2618
02:19:06,112 --> 02:19:07,392
Which as you say is complete

2619
02:19:07,904 --> 02:19:08,672
Within your rights

2620
02:19:08,928 --> 02:19:09,952
How to change your opinion about

2621
02:19:11,232 --> 02:19:12,256
I just want to know

2622
02:19:12,768 --> 02:19:13,280
Weather

2623
02:19:15,584 --> 02:19:16,608
I can presume

2624
02:19:16,864 --> 02:19:17,632
That because you

2625
02:19:19,424 --> 02:19:19,936
Actors

2626
02:19:20,192 --> 02:19:21,216
In fact

2627
02:19:21,472 --> 02:19:22,240
Believe at that time

2628
02:19:22,752 --> 02:19:23,264
Correct

2629
02:19:24,800 --> 02:19:28,128
Then I don't know exactly what my

2630
02:19:29,664 --> 02:19:30,688
Why do my boosters

2631
02:19:32,480 --> 02:19:38,624
Well then that means it's infuriating I mean it's it's basically like here is a statement that they made in the past

2632
02:19:39,136 --> 02:19:40,416
Does that mean you believe X

2633
02:19:40,928 --> 02:19:42,720
FedEx

2634
02:19:42,976 --> 02:19:46,816
Determine one way or the other because we can't go back in time I don't really know

2635
02:19:47,072 --> 02:19:52,704
And even if I did think that it's illegal for me to think that I mean and I don't think that now

2636
02:19:52,960 --> 02:19:59,104
Question in the past I'm confused as to whether or not he believes

2637
02:19:59,360 --> 02:20:01,664
That be I don't think that anymore

2638
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:04,480
Is not an admission that he did think it

2639
02:20:04,736 --> 02:20:08,064
It's implied but not necessary

2640
02:20:08,320 --> 02:20:14,464
Well I guess if you say I don't believe that anymore it does strongly indicate that you did believe it before cuz it

2641
02:20:17,792 --> 02:20:20,096
Believe something different in the past

2642
02:20:20,608 --> 02:20:26,240
And not have believed it you can say I don't believe that now it doesn't imply that you

2643
02:20:26,496 --> 02:20:29,568
True didn't believe it but where you believed it before

2644
02:20:29,824 --> 02:20:35,456
I don't know who cares he's just it it's it's infuriating the way they can't answer a direct question

2645
02:20:35,712 --> 02:20:41,856
Medically for someone who insist that not answering questions is it indicative of guilt

2646
02:20:42,112 --> 02:20:44,928
That is that is the the Hallmark

2647
02:20:45,184 --> 02:20:46,976
Of a right-wing person

2648
02:20:47,232 --> 02:20:49,536
Is just the thing that they are

2649
02:20:50,048 --> 02:20:56,192
Is the thing they hate the most like Bedrock most important Prince

2650
02:20:56,448 --> 02:21:02,592
Suppose are usually actually incredibly negotiable everybody should have gun rights but I probably would take

2651
02:21:02,848 --> 02:21:06,944
Take guns away from antifa

2652
02:21:07,456 --> 02:21:12,576
We come to the end basically this is just a little bit of the deposition left

2653
02:21:12,832 --> 02:21:16,160
And subjective some like Communications comes up

2654
02:21:16,672 --> 02:21:21,536
And Maddie asks when the last time he talked to Rob do was

2655
02:21:21,792 --> 02:21:22,560
And this

2656
02:21:22,816 --> 02:21:23,584
Is why you let

2657
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:25,120
Batondy just talk

2658
02:21:25,376 --> 02:21:27,936
Because this is a very bizarre admission

2659
02:21:28,448 --> 02:21:28,960
What was your most

2660
02:21:29,984 --> 02:21:30,752
Communication with

2661
02:21:31,008 --> 02:21:31,520
With Rob to

2662
02:21:36,896 --> 02:21:38,688
Merry 4th of July

2663
02:21:41,504 --> 02:21:44,576
No I'm sorry I'm not too long ago and text him to tell him

2664
02:21:44,832 --> 02:21:45,600
Megashare

2665
02:21:45,856 --> 02:21:46,880
Subpoena

2666
02:21:50,464 --> 02:21:51,232
You have that texting your

2667
02:21:52,256 --> 02:21:52,768
No

2668
02:21:54,048 --> 02:21:54,816
I'm sorry

2669
02:21:55,072 --> 02:21:55,584
Well

2670
02:21:57,888 --> 02:21:58,400
Did she receive

2671
02:21:58,912 --> 02:22:00,192
Tina after you got rid of your last

2672
02:22:03,008 --> 02:22:03,520
No

2673
02:22:04,288 --> 02:22:04,800
What

2674
02:22:05,824 --> 02:22:06,592
I'm sorry

2675
02:22:07,616 --> 02:22:08,128
When we

2676
02:22:10,688 --> 02:22:11,200
You haven't

2677
02:22:12,224 --> 02:22:13,504
Yo what's going on

2678
02:22:16,832 --> 02:22:17,600
Subpoena

2679
02:22:21,184 --> 02:22:22,464
You know you f***** up just a bit

2680
02:22:22,976 --> 02:22:23,488
Come on man

2681
02:22:24,768 --> 02:22:26,816
You deleted the text we know

2682
02:22:27,072 --> 02:22:28,352
20

2683
02:22:29,376 --> 02:22:30,400
723

2684
02:22:31,424 --> 02:22:31,936
July

2685
02:22:41,408 --> 02:22:42,944
And so did you have your new phone by

2686
02:22:45,504 --> 02:22:46,528
No that's not

2687
02:22:46,784 --> 02:22:48,576
Nothing to do with the other emails

2688
02:22:48,832 --> 02:22:49,344
Text whatever

2689
02:22:50,368 --> 02:22:51,904
I text your text message

2690
02:22:52,160 --> 02:22:52,672
Mr. Abdul

2691
02:22:54,208 --> 02:22:56,000
This one here has new flame

2692
02:22:56,256 --> 02:22:58,304
Isaac Rob doomsday until I got served

2693
02:22:59,072 --> 02:22:59,584
Right

2694
02:23:00,096 --> 02:23:00,864
It's a what

2695
02:23:01,376 --> 02:23:02,656
Why don't you produce that text to

2696
02:23:04,448 --> 02:23:05,728
Because I don't have it

2697
02:23:06,496 --> 02:23:07,264
Did you delete it

2698
02:23:08,288 --> 02:23:09,312
Yeah I believe

2699
02:23:13,408 --> 02:23:15,456
Car mobile.

2700
02:23:16,480 --> 02:23:18,272
As of the time you sent that text

2701
02:23:20,064 --> 02:23:21,600
Do something

2702
02:23:25,696 --> 02:23:26,720
I do it right after I text

2703
02:23:29,792 --> 02:23:30,304
He said delete it

2704
02:23:35,424 --> 02:23:36,960
Do you know how

2705
02:23:38,240 --> 02:23:38,752
Oh yeah

2706
02:23:39,008 --> 02:23:39,776
We have to do

2707
02:23:40,032 --> 02:23:40,544
Stuff nowadays

2708
02:23:41,568 --> 02:23:42,592
Show me the picture understand

2709
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:45,920
You got the subpoena in July twenty

2710
02:23:46,688 --> 02:23:47,200
Right

2711
02:23:50,784 --> 02:23:51,552
You got yourself

2712
02:23:52,576 --> 02:23:53,088
Sometime after that

2713
02:23:53,344 --> 02:23:53,856
Right

2714
02:23:54,880 --> 02:23:55,392
I don't

2715
02:23:57,184 --> 02:23:58,464
You register mobile.

2716
02:24:01,536 --> 02:24:02,048
Correct

2717
02:24:03,072 --> 02:24:04,352
Think of the subpoena.

2718
02:24:04,864 --> 02:24:05,632
Yeah you read it

2719
02:24:07,936 --> 02:24:08,704
You knew that it

2720
02:24:08,960 --> 02:24:09,472
Instructed YouTube

2721
02:24:09,984 --> 02:24:10,496
Communication

2722
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:12,544
With you

2723
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:13,824
Including Mr do

2724
02:24:14,080 --> 02:24:14,592
Correct

2725
02:24:15,360 --> 02:24:17,152
Yeah but that's top rated

2726
02:24:19,456 --> 02:24:20,224
In

2727
02:24:20,480 --> 02:24:22,528
You then texted Mr do about this loss

2728
02:24:26,368 --> 02:24:27,648
And then you deleted that text

2729
02:24:29,440 --> 02:24:29,952
Yes

2730
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:39,168
Oh my gosh subpoenaed what do I say

2731
02:24:42,752 --> 02:24:45,824
He said you asked him what do I do and he said I don't know what to tell you

2732
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:57,088
This isn't indicative of somebody who doesn't know enough to lie

2733
02:24:57,344 --> 02:24:57,856
You know like

2734
02:24:58,112 --> 02:24:59,904
He doesn't know how bad that looks know

2735
02:25:01,440 --> 02:25:07,584
He has on this episode episode this deposition

2736
02:25:07,840 --> 02:25:10,912
Memes about like a habit of deleting messages and stuff like that

2737
02:25:11,168 --> 02:25:15,520
So it's not out of the ordinary for a behavior that he is described already

2738
02:25:15,776 --> 02:25:16,544
Bart

2739
02:25:16,800 --> 02:25:18,848
The circumstances of this look

2740
02:25:19,104 --> 02:25:20,640
Very bad

2741
02:25:20,896 --> 02:25:27,040
Genuinely believe him when he says that Rob do told him I don't know what to say but there's no way to know

2742
02:25:27,296 --> 02:25:33,440
Exactly demand Rob do turnover

2743
02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:35,232
But

2744
02:25:35,488 --> 02:25:41,632
I would have been obviously of course they deleted it makes you look real bad

2745
02:25:41,888 --> 02:25:48,032
Yeah hey real quick you want to do some witness tampering over-the-phone you mind giving me a call and then leave

2746
02:25:48,288 --> 02:25:52,896
Record of it

2747
02:25:53,152 --> 02:25:58,528
That's why you're use burner phones if you're in a criminal organization

2748
02:25:58,784 --> 02:26:02,880
Talk about a criminal conspiracy over the phone

2749
02:26:03,136 --> 02:26:04,160
This

2750
02:26:04,672 --> 02:26:05,440
Is

2751
02:26:05,952 --> 02:26:07,488
Did not

2752
02:26:07,744 --> 02:26:13,632
Other lawyer makes a decent point and that is like there is an implication here that

2753
02:26:13,888 --> 02:26:20,032
You're saying that he deleted this message to try to cover something up or hide something

2754
02:26:20,288 --> 02:26:20,800
And that

2755
02:26:21,056 --> 02:26:27,200
Not necessarily demonstrated like men's Raya isn't there like intent

2756
02:26:27,712 --> 02:26:33,856
I don't feel it necessarily from badonde the act itself

2757
02:26:34,112 --> 02:26:40,256
Is problematic like I said I believe but I believe that he regularly delay

2758
02:26:40,512 --> 02:26:41,024
Delete this text

2759
02:26:41,536 --> 02:26:42,560
That makes sense to me

2760
02:26:42,816 --> 02:26:47,936
And I don't think it untie and I very much doubt that Rob do wood

2761
02:26:48,192 --> 02:26:50,240
Witness tampering

2762
02:26:50,496 --> 02:26:56,640
Over the phone I'm sorry I just think that might be a step too I think he would but I also think that he

2763
02:26:57,920 --> 02:27:04,064
Vedonde

2764
02:27:04,320 --> 02:27:09,440
It's chaos now the question comes up when did you last speak to Alex

2765
02:27:09,696 --> 02:27:10,464
And

2766
02:27:10,720 --> 02:27:12,512
This is a revelation 2014

2767
02:27:13,024 --> 02:27:15,072
When was the last time you communicated anyway with Alex

2768
02:27:17,888 --> 02:27:19,424
O-over year ago

2769
02:27:21,216 --> 02:27:21,728
What was that commute

2770
02:27:23,264 --> 02:27:24,544
We Naturals deposition

2771
02:27:25,056 --> 02:27:26,336
Because I I was

2772
02:27:26,592 --> 02:27:28,128
Wow

2773
02:27:29,152 --> 02:27:31,200
Toby Donna River Falls New York

2774
02:27:39,392 --> 02:27:40,672
Mr. Jones called you after

2775
02:27:40,928 --> 02:27:41,440
What is deposition

2776
02:27:42,208 --> 02:27:44,000
Stay off Media

2777
02:27:45,792 --> 02:27:47,072
Does Megyn Kelly work

2778
02:27:49,376 --> 02:27:51,168
I don't go on Megyn Kelly show

2779
02:27:52,960 --> 02:27:53,472
Disgusting

2780
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:02,688
So

2781
02:28:05,504 --> 02:28:06,016
He called you

2782
02:28:06,784 --> 02:28:07,552
About a year ago

2783
02:28:08,832 --> 02:28:09,856
After his deposition

2784
02:28:10,624 --> 02:28:13,952
Are you awake about a week. Even less than a week after the deposition

2785
02:28:14,464 --> 02:28:14,976
Okay

2786
02:28:15,744 --> 02:28:16,256
And

2787
02:28:17,792 --> 02:28:20,608
You understood that he was calling you you because

2788
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:23,936
It may have appeared to you that he sold you down the river

2789
02:28:27,008 --> 02:28:33,152
This is more Bob stuff

2790
02:28:33,408 --> 02:28:38,528
I'm kind of a weird on but he doesn't use burner phones

2791
02:28:38,784 --> 02:28:40,320
Hey don't snitch

2792
02:28:42,368 --> 02:28:44,160
Joe chocolate oats a s***

2793
02:28:44,416 --> 02:28:47,744
I'm sorry excuse me sir are you saying in this deposition

2794
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:49,536
That the main defendant

2795
02:28:49,792 --> 02:28:50,560
Cold you

2796
02:28:50,816 --> 02:28:56,960
Following a deposition in his deposition Alex tried to downplay severely

2797
02:28:57,472 --> 02:29:03,616
He's barely an employer already know the guy are you really

2798
02:29:03,872 --> 02:29:10,016
Because batondy was mad about that characterization of their relationship to Alex had to do damage

2799
02:29:10,272 --> 02:29:10,784
Control

2800
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:17,184
And at the same time be like hey also don't talk to anybody

2801
02:29:17,440 --> 02:29:21,280
Weird line that's a weird thread

2802
02:29:21,536 --> 02:29:27,680
You know because you have to I mean you're going to try and smooth things over because you want him to stay quiet

2803
02:29:27,936 --> 02:29:34,080
But you also have to be like if you talk I'll kill you you know like that kind of thing here's what's fascinating about this

2804
02:29:34,336 --> 02:29:37,920
Pedotti's experience of it is the same as his firing

2805
02:29:38,176 --> 02:29:44,320
Alex was calling because he felt bad about how he cares for what a good guy

2806
02:29:44,576 --> 02:29:46,368
You know what

2807
02:29:46,624 --> 02:29:50,720
He didn't need to do that you need to call me on some level

2808
02:29:50,976 --> 02:29:55,584
I know he thinks he thinks Alex called him because he was right

2809
02:29:55,840 --> 02:30:00,448
Definitely

2810
02:30:00,960 --> 02:30:01,984
You understood that he was

2811
02:30:02,240 --> 02:30:03,520
Calling you because

2812
02:30:04,032 --> 02:30:04,544
It may have it

2813
02:30:04,800 --> 02:30:05,568
Here to you that he

2814
02:30:05,824 --> 02:30:06,848
He sold you down the river

2815
02:30:07,360 --> 02:30:07,872
Is deposition

2816
02:30:08,640 --> 02:30:09,152
Yes

2817
02:30:10,176 --> 02:30:11,200
Sold you down the river

2818
02:30:13,248 --> 02:30:14,528
Well he was just sad

2819
02:30:14,784 --> 02:30:16,064
United I worked for him then

2820
02:30:19,136 --> 02:30:20,928
We got different things he didn't understand

2821
02:30:21,184 --> 02:30:22,976
We will rob do screen

2822
02:30:25,024 --> 02:30:25,792
I don't need to repeat that

2823
02:30:27,584 --> 02:30:30,144
Yeah but the fact that you do

2824
02:30:30,912 --> 02:30:31,936
He was worried you may a

2825
02:30:32,192 --> 02:30:33,728
Selling you down the river is not

2826
02:30:33,984 --> 02:30:34,496
In the deposition

2827
02:30:34,752 --> 02:30:35,520
That's what I'm asking

2828
02:30:37,568 --> 02:30:38,080
That he was

2829
02:30:38,336 --> 02:30:38,848
Concerned about

2830
02:30:40,384 --> 02:30:42,688
Who's concerned that

2831
02:30:44,736 --> 02:30:46,016
He's so mean.

2832
02:30:46,528 --> 02:30:47,296
I saw them down the river

2833
02:30:50,368 --> 02:30:50,880
The Beast

2834
02:30:51,136 --> 02:30:52,160
A misunderstanding

2835
02:30:55,744 --> 02:30:56,768
Okay so

2836
02:30:57,024 --> 02:30:58,816
He was concerned that you may have

2837
02:30:59,840 --> 02:31:01,376
Is deposition

2838
02:31:03,424 --> 02:31:04,704
By suggesting that you hadn't really

2839
02:31:07,776 --> 02:31:08,288
Correct

2840
02:31:10,592 --> 02:31:11,104
And

2841
02:31:12,128 --> 02:31:14,688
He also instructed you that if anybody contact

2842
02:31:14,944 --> 02:31:15,456
About San Diego

2843
02:31:15,968 --> 02:31:16,480
Not the same

2844
02:31:18,016 --> 02:31:19,552
Yes the mainstream media

2845
02:31:20,832 --> 02:31:22,112
Did you say the meteor just say anybody

2846
02:31:23,136 --> 02:31:24,160
Median job means

2847
02:31:24,416 --> 02:31:24,928
Schmedium

2848
02:31:25,184 --> 02:31:26,208
So it's

2849
02:31:26,720 --> 02:31:32,864
Notable that Alex doesn't disclose this until he's asked about it and the other deposition news

2850
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:35,168
Maybe I did I don't know

2851
02:31:36,704 --> 02:31:38,496
This is Shady

2852
02:31:39,264 --> 02:31:44,384
Donnie doesn't realize it's so shady just like with the texting and deleting

2853
02:31:44,896 --> 02:31:49,760
Like he doesn't realize what he's saying is is like almost probably

2854
02:31:50,016 --> 02:31:50,528
Shocking

2855
02:31:51,040 --> 02:31:53,088
2 for a lawyer to hear like

2856
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:54,112
What

2857
02:31:54,368 --> 02:31:55,392
You're telling me

2858
02:31:57,440 --> 02:31:58,208
Alex

2859
02:31:58,464 --> 02:32:00,000
The person who this cases against

2860
02:32:00,256 --> 02:32:04,608
Contacted you to smooth things out with you about things he said in the deposition

2861
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:08,704
And also told you not to talk to the mainstream media

2862
02:32:09,216 --> 02:32:09,984
This is

2863
02:32:11,008 --> 02:32:15,616
Let me ask you a question have you ever seen Law and Order

2864
02:32:15,872 --> 02:32:22,016
Or l.a. law or Boston Legal or any number

2865
02:32:22,272 --> 02:32:24,832
Movie The Lincoln Lawyer

2866
02:32:25,088 --> 02:32:27,136
A Few Good Men

2867
02:32:27,392 --> 02:32:28,160
You name it

2868
02:32:28,672 --> 02:32:29,696
And they're there

2869
02:32:29,952 --> 02:32:31,744
And in every law show their like

2870
02:32:32,256 --> 02:32:38,400
Don't tamper with the witness cuz it's going to look bad no matter what contacting batondy

2871
02:32:38,656 --> 02:32:44,800
Especially since it's probably been a long time since they spoke is a very inappropriate Act

2872
02:32:45,824 --> 02:32:49,920
Know if you know the context of their relationship just the call is witness tampering

2873
02:32:50,176 --> 02:32:53,760
It feels like at least the intent is

2874
02:32:54,528 --> 02:33:00,672
I don't want you to be mad at me because if you're mad at me it's more likely that you'll say things because I've been take just to me

2875
02:33:00,928 --> 02:33:03,744
Trying to smooth things out at the same time tell you to shut up

2876
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:10,144
I bet I can't tell you to shut up Megan Kelly Lord me into the situation

2877
02:33:10,400 --> 02:33:16,544
It's bad things happen when you talk to the media what a great survey

2878
02:33:16,800 --> 02:33:19,872
Like you to talk to my friend who the lawyer how my god did you acknowledge

2879
02:33:20,128 --> 02:33:20,896
That you had

2880
02:33:21,408 --> 02:33:21,920
Felt

2881
02:33:22,432 --> 02:33:23,200
A little bit like

2882
02:33:23,456 --> 02:33:25,248
He had misrepresented your

2883

Affiliation

2884
02:33:28,832 --> 02:33:30,112
Yeah oh yeah it works.

2885
02:33:31,904 --> 02:33:33,440
One of his Warriors and whoever was next

2886
02:33:34,208 --> 02:33:35,488
Set the time

2887
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:36,768
And he was

2888
02:33:37,024 --> 02:33:39,328
I felt I was so low I told

2889
02:33:41,120 --> 02:33:42,144
What happened

2890
02:33:42,656 --> 02:33:43,936

2891
02:34:01,088 --> 02:34:02,368
Fumigation edict favorite

2892
02:34:03,648 --> 02:34:04,160
That wasn't

2893
02:34:04,416 --> 02:34:05,952
About children

2894
02:34:07,744 --> 02:34:12,096
There's a miscommunication there's no big deal

2895
02:34:12,352 --> 02:34:13,120
I

2896
02:34:13,632 --> 02:34:14,400
I mean

2897
02:34:14,656 --> 02:34:16,448
Yeah that is

2898
02:34:16,704 --> 02:34:17,728
A little sad

2899
02:34:17,984 --> 02:34:18,496
Tacular

2900
02:34:18,752 --> 02:34:24,640
It's a bummer it is Eddie's kitchen level is Obama

2901
02:34:24,896 --> 02:34:30,016
Because these people are these people but nothing if you just heard this about like

2902
02:34:30,272 --> 02:34:33,344
I don't know high-schoolers interacting give me sad

2903
02:34:34,880 --> 02:34:37,952
31 live clip here and it's just think I'd like

2904
02:34:39,232 --> 02:34:40,256
Damn cat

2905
02:34:40,768 --> 02:34:43,584
Understand how he's being treated and it's

2906
02:34:44,096 --> 02:34:45,120
It's outrageous

2907
02:34:45,632 --> 02:34:46,656
You believe that Miss

2908
02:34:46,912 --> 02:34:48,192
Esther Jones was misrepresented

2909
02:34:52,288 --> 02:34:52,800
His

2910
02:34:57,920 --> 02:34:58,688

2911
02:34:59,200 --> 02:34:59,968

Under the Gunn

2913
02:35:05,600 --> 02:35:06,624
And you don't

2914
02:35:07,136 --> 02:35:11,744
The guy like that be so much things going on

2915
02:35:13,024 --> 02:35:13,792
Lakewood

2916
02:35:16,352 --> 02:35:16,864
I mean

2917
02:35:17,632 --> 02:35:20,448
And we can shop people here trying to do I drop save the restroom

2918
02:35:21,728 --> 02:35:22,240
This country

2919
02:35:22,496 --> 02:35:23,264
It means a while

2920
02:35:25,568 --> 02:35:26,592
Questions

2921
02:35:27,104 --> 02:35:28,896
Old General facts about all this

2922
02:35:29,920 --> 02:35:31,712
And you said his lawyer was

2923
02:35:31,968 --> 02:35:32,480
Was with him at the

2924
02:35:36,064 --> 02:35:37,344
Did I briefly talked to

2925
02:35:37,600 --> 02:35:38,112
Thunderman

2926
02:35:38,624 --> 02:35:40,160
I did give them a contact

2927
02:35:40,416 --> 02:35:40,928
Does mission

2928
02:35:44,256 --> 02:35:45,536
I've got the person's name

2929
02:35:47,840 --> 02:35:53,984
I'm willing to bet Alex at his lawyer so you'd have like confidentiality it have the privilege did not have to disclose

2930
02:35:54,496 --> 02:35:56,288
A conversation with his lawyer

2931
02:35:57,568 --> 02:35:58,336
But

2932
02:36:00,896 --> 02:36:07,040
He's under a lot of stress man I Delight about our interaction at the nature of my employ

2933
02:36:07,296 --> 02:36:12,672
Appointment they are because he's just so stressed out he's he's got a lot going on right now so he

2934
02:36:12,928 --> 02:36:19,072
He purchased himself deposition of all the excuses one could have for a person's Behavior stress

2935
02:36:19,328 --> 02:36:25,472
Position to make it look like it was way more my fault break

2936
02:36:25,728 --> 02:36:31,360
Really involved with me at all right but he's a good guy you're just looking out is worried about me

2937
02:36:31,616 --> 02:36:32,128
Right

2938
02:36:32,640 --> 02:36:33,408
It is

2939
02:36:33,664 --> 02:36:34,944
It is strange

2940
02:36:35,456 --> 02:36:39,808
That dhanbad Auntie did not realize that Alex called to

2941
02:36:40,064 --> 02:36:41,088
To say that he

2942
02:36:41,344 --> 02:36:41,856
Didn't

2943
02:36:42,624 --> 02:36:43,648
But

2944
02:36:43,904 --> 02:36:45,696
Want to pin things on him

2945
02:36:45,952 --> 02:36:48,768
Because Alex did Once Upon things on him

2946
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:50,560
And that was why he was doing

2947
02:36:50,816 --> 02:36:55,424
You realize like maybe in hindsight that in order for it to work

2948
02:36:55,680 --> 02:37:01,824
Arab smooth bongino batondy onboard at least

2949
02:37:02,080 --> 02:37:07,968
Not working at cross-purposes but what he didn't know was that regardless of Bud on these intentions

2950
02:37:08,224 --> 02:37:11,552
But Andy's going to do that's just what's going to happen

2951
02:37:11,808 --> 02:37:15,392
So we come to the end of this deposition I mean

2952
02:37:15,904 --> 02:37:16,928
Something else

2953
02:37:17,184 --> 02:37:23,328
I think it's interesting to get a glimpse of his his personality on more display because

2954
02:37:23,584 --> 02:37:26,656
You know there is that sincerity aspect that you

2955
02:37:26,912 --> 02:37:29,984
Serta put your finger on and I think there's something to that

2956
02:37:30,240 --> 02:37:31,520
I meant at the same time

2957
02:37:31,776 --> 02:37:35,360
Like whether it's kayfabe or whether it's just like

2958
02:37:35,872 --> 02:37:36,896
Who he is

2959
02:37:37,152 --> 02:37:43,296
There is an unwillingness to not yell about like I will not shut up and

2960
02:37:43,552 --> 02:37:45,344
Can't silence me I don't respect

2961
02:37:45,856 --> 02:37:47,648
And in a way that

2962
02:37:48,416 --> 02:37:52,256
I don't think a lot of these other people have necessarily you know how old up

2963
02:37:53,024 --> 02:37:53,536
It's

2964
02:37:53,792 --> 02:37:56,096
I I just I mean

2965
02:37:57,120 --> 02:38:00,192
It's hard to die could like I want to use the word naive

2966
02:38:00,448 --> 02:38:06,592
I feel like naive is such a good word for him I think in terms of his interaction with Alex

2967
02:38:06,848 --> 02:38:09,408
Chris like

2968
02:38:09,664 --> 02:38:15,808
The way he describes Alex shaking his hand and tell him it's so amazing for you gets fired

2969
02:38:16,064 --> 02:38:17,088
That's nice

2970
02:38:17,344 --> 02:38:19,136
Yeah for sure

2971
02:38:19,392 --> 02:38:19,904
Man

2972
02:38:20,416 --> 02:38:20,928
It's

2973
02:38:21,184 --> 02:38:21,952
It's sad

2974
02:38:22,976 --> 02:38:23,744
Don't like

2975
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:25,536
Feel. I don't like

2976
02:38:26,048 --> 02:38:28,352
People who are manipulated

2977
02:38:28,608 --> 02:38:30,656
Who clearly cannot

2978
02:38:30,912 --> 02:38:31,424
Get out of

2979
02:38:31,680 --> 02:38:32,448
And also suck

2980
02:38:33,216 --> 02:38:34,240
Then I would like it sucks

2981
02:38:34,496 --> 02:38:40,640
Disease of the s*** working it's really bad stuff out that hurts people into the information

2982
02:38:40,896 --> 02:38:42,688
In space so it's it's

2983
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:46,272
It's more complicated to have pesos in the mix

2984
02:38:46,528 --> 02:38:49,600
But when he's describing these interactions with Alex that are like

2985
02:38:49,856 --> 02:38:56,000
Everything was so great he called me Paul Revere like all this it's harder to Lycra

2986
02:38:56,256 --> 02:38:56,768
Really

2987
02:38:57,024 --> 02:38:57,536
Fuel

2988
02:38:57,792 --> 02:39:01,120
Empathy

2989
02:39:01,376 --> 02:39:05,216
Yeah I was just f****** with him here's the problem

2990
02:39:05,472 --> 02:39:07,776
Here's the problem with this type of s*** right

2991
02:39:08,032 --> 02:39:08,544
He has

2992
02:39:08,800 --> 02:39:10,848
The proverbial it coming

2993
02:39:11,360 --> 02:39:17,504
Right there but the it he has coming shouldn't take this form this is weird this is cruel and unusual punishment

2994
02:39:17,760 --> 02:39:23,904
Make him think he's Alex's friend but that's not that's not the law

2995
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:29,536
You're not doing that to him that coming

2996
02:39:29,792 --> 02:39:35,936
And you'd wish that there would be a moment of like being able to see through that b******* in the way Alex is acting

2997
02:39:36,192 --> 02:39:42,336
I am like to take an accounting of his actual action and be able to be helpful to

2998
02:39:42,592 --> 02:39:45,408
Illuminate better what Alex was doing

2999
02:39:45,664 --> 02:39:51,808
The machinations of it the way the two people were intentionally pushing this stuff

3000
02:39:52,064 --> 02:39:54,624
Chris Brown tears apart of it he was there

3001
02:39:54,880 --> 02:39:58,208
I'm sure on some level he knows but doesn't want to touch

3002
02:39:58,464 --> 02:40:01,792
That part of himself or allowed to be expressed because of

3003
02:40:02,560 --> 02:40:06,400
Now why would you want to burn somebody who thinks or Paul Revere exactly it's hard

3004
02:40:06,656 --> 02:40:07,168
It's

3005
02:40:07,680 --> 02:40:08,192
It's crazy

3006
02:40:08,704 --> 02:40:12,800
I think that the one thing that will not leave me ever from this

3007
02:40:13,056 --> 02:40:13,568
Is

3008
02:40:14,080 --> 02:40:14,592
That

3009
02:40:14,848 --> 02:40:15,360
Did you write

3010
02:40:15,616 --> 02:40:21,760
YouTube Roku know how that who's on first will frustrate me probably for the rest

3011
02:40:22,016 --> 02:40:28,160
I'm so mad at everyone in these depositions for doing the exact same thing sooner or later which is trying to

3012
02:40:28,416 --> 02:40:29,696
To somehow obfuscate

3013
02:40:29,952 --> 02:40:32,000
In a way that they think will outsmart

3014
02:40:32,256 --> 02:40:36,608
Jump don't play word games with the lawyer that's not a good idea

3015
02:40:36,864 --> 02:40:37,888
Hard not to

3016
02:40:38,144 --> 02:40:41,728
Steptoe and

3017
02:40:42,240 --> 02:40:43,520
Dundee got to pose

3018
02:40:43,776 --> 02:40:44,288
Kraken

3019
02:40:44,544 --> 02:40:47,872
It's got to go back in the cage

3020
02:40:48,128 --> 02:40:54,272
Return return to his his whole episode on Friday and I believe

3021
02:40:54,528 --> 02:40:56,832
Leave that way it'll be unpleasant against

3022
02:40:57,088 --> 02:41:02,976
Prepare your emotional estate accordingly

3023
02:41:03,232 --> 02:41:08,096
Website the real quick I just want to apologize

3024
02:41:08,352 --> 02:41:10,656
The on our last episode

3025
02:41:10,912 --> 02:41:16,288
I made repeated references to 20s

3026
02:41:16,800 --> 02:41:22,944
Performing oral sex on Kanye and it was brought to my attention that I was a real big

3027
02:41:23,200 --> 02:41:23,712
Sebastopol

3028
02:41:23,968 --> 02:41:27,552
That's apparently it was

3029
02:41:27,808 --> 02:41:30,624
Coded language in Omaha

3030
02:41:30,880 --> 02:41:37,024
Yeah there's a homophobic and misogynistic implications and I appreciate you bringing that up I appreciate

3031
02:41:37,280 --> 02:41:38,816
Do you

3032
02:41:39,072 --> 02:41:41,376
Saying something because it was

3033
02:41:41,632 --> 02:41:43,424
I was I was wrong

3034
02:41:50,080 --> 02:41:56,224
Time to bring it up in the beginning certainly not your bright spot I still and then we went straight into the

3035
02:41:56,480 --> 02:42:02,624
Don't know why I know I know but I

3036
02:42:02,880 --> 02:42:06,976
I appreciate you bringing it up tonight I think it is important and I didn't want to

3037
02:42:07,232 --> 02:42:13,376
Force you into saying something

3038
02:42:13,632 --> 02:42:19,776
Like a scolding parents are you ready to come out

3039
02:42:20,032 --> 02:42:23,104
I appreciate that I was I was wrong I'll be better today

3040
02:42:24,896 --> 02:42:31,040
And we are on Twitter

3041
02:42:31,296 --> 02:42:32,832
No I'm Leo MDX Clark

3042
02:42:33,088 --> 02:42:33,856
Look

3043
02:42:34,368 --> 02:42:38,464
There'll be another bait at some point I feel like I'm Wikileaks bettas really run its course

3044
02:42:39,232 --> 02:42:40,768
I mean

3045
02:42:41,024 --> 02:42:42,560
That sounds true

3046
02:42:42,816 --> 02:42:43,584
But

3047
02:42:43,840 --> 02:42:49,984
I will let you know and under so-called way of me trying to

3048
02:42:50,240 --> 02:42:53,824
Assertive Bridge

3049
02:42:54,080 --> 02:42:58,688
In this case it that is not the case goddamn you know what's funny about that

3050
02:42:59,456 --> 02:43:00,480
I got it right here

3051
02:43:01,248 --> 02:43:02,016
I just got a text

3052
02:43:04,064 --> 02:43:05,344
Whatever the hell is this

3053
02:43:05,856 --> 02:43:07,136
What happened you got to read this

3054
02:43:07,392 --> 02:43:08,416
Does it read the text

3055
02:43:09,952 --> 02:43:16,096
God dammit it's the Wikileaks look it was a low effort

3056
02:43:16,608 --> 02:43:19,936
The sex robot

3057
02:43:21,728 --> 02:43:25,568
