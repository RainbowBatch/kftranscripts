1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Damn important I sweat it

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for knowledge B

3
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,832
Stripe.com

4
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,536
A little bit about

5
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,304
Alex

6
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,328
Dune

7
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,424
Bbr Dan Jordan Tim Jordan have a quick question for you

8
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:12,960
Today

9
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:18,080
But my bright spot today is I have

10
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,616
I have

11
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,176
Bye

12
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,480
Instagram account that was

13
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,760
About plants

14
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:32,160
To now a library based Instagram account I believe it's Library underscore fight

15
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:38,560
Okay and I posted a couple of things from the library on there

16
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:43,936
The latest one that I posted was the first edition copy that I got of

17
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,752
The John Franklin letters

18
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:51,104
Which of course is widely believed and understood to have been written by

19
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,200
Reveal Opie Oliver the one of the founding members of the

20
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,504
John Birch Society who I was a

21
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,808
Inspiration to William Luther Pierce

22
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:06,208
And went on to calendar Diaries we already know everyone knows

23
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,000
It's disgusting schools in

24
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:14,400
It's not like this is a first edition that's like super expensive or anything

25
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:17,216
Treasure but Eric's I grew up

26
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,008
Really liking books

27
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:19,776
My love

28
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,336
Solid book

29
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,616
Thing

30
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,200
I don't know it to have a first edition of something

31
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,736
He's always felt like

32
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:35,136
Aspiration I'm telling you when somebody sent me the first edition of

33
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:38,464
Good Heavens no Hitchhiker's Guide

34
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,744
That's

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,144
That's mind-boggling I still a little sometimes look over a bad I don't even know if that's real yeah yeah

36
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:53,312
It's it's something that's in my like sort of sphere of study and it's a it's a it's a

37
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,384
Document it's a antique

38
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,944
You know what

39
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,808
Yeah I noticed there's something really great about that is awful of a book

40
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,576
Cuz it is

41
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,648
I'll probably talk about the book at some point

42
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:16,608
Anyway with your break but you know how I love the speed running of the video games

43
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,544
Who's a northern Irish

44
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,080
Streamer

45
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:31,968
Who did a 22-hour Final Fantasy 9 Garnet only

46
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,552
A-Rod and I know I know that makes

47
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:40,928
That sounds like the nerdiest possible thing that you could say it's great that mean exactly

48
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:47,328
Is an extremely long

49
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:53,728
Game right and you can play with four characters

50
00:03:53,984 --> 00:04:00,128
When a main character the only players that only play with her okay

51
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:06,528
All your other party members every time before you start a battle and for 90% of the game she is V week

52
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,320
Most useless character

53
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,880
Example being in this run

54
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,672
All right on purpose

55
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,976
You have to fight

56
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,000
A fight

57
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,303
For about 45 minutes

58
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:22,399
Sure and all you do is hold X4 45-minute that'll add its

59
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:28,799
Horrendous stuff to speedrun what happens is it turns into an absolute chaos

60
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,383
Fast everybody slowly losing their minds from Black

61
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,943
Sleep everybody's like what are we doing this is

62
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:40,575
We're just holding back for 45 minutes it's that it's at

63
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,391
Creation of a chaos that I love

64
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,207
So so much

65
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:52,863
I don't think I will cuz I'm just watching even know

66
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,935
Here's another good reason Northern Irish accent

67
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,495
Sure I'll give you that much love it

68
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,775
I do think

69
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,823
There are you find some

70
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,871
Speedrunning interesting

71
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,687
Because I like games and you know like

72
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,247
Sometimes just want to watch somebody play a game

73
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:14,111
But I'd only want to hear about speedrunning

74
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,671
Basically when it comes to things ahead like

75
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,487
A lot of glitches in

76
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:25,887
Somebody be something really fast with these glitches and things like I don't think it's I guess but it's not fun to watch

77
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:32,287
Oh okay hearing about it it's kind of interesting and maybe somebody explaining what these glitches are is helpful

78
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,311
But like

79
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:39,967
I don't know I don't want to watch Mario go through a wall I can't really just watched like one of the

80
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:45,599
Dealer streams are the like you know people sitting alone at home playing the video game as fast as I can and

81
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,695
The big Live Events altimate lie there it's like

82
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,999
Well we're speedrunning but it's a show

83
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:55,071
Right now it's a show I want to watch a scrimmage

84
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:00,191
Well it's a really good way of putting it.

85
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:06,591
That's why it's so Jordan today I apologize right before we started recording

86
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:12,991
Flexible uppercut right I was about to hit the record button

87
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:17,599
And before you could respond

88
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:21,183
And the reason for that is we're talking a little bit more about Yang and Knicks win

89
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,951
That's great

90
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,023
So there have been developments

91
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,351
There's more developments there have been yes

92
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:34,751
So the first thing is that yay and Nick have been making the rounds

93
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:39,103
More of the second thing is that Alex has spoken out

94
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,383
About what happened

95
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,711
Sounds great and then Nick has responded to Alex's speakingout

96
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:50,111
Going to discuss this Trinity of nonsense in this episode

97
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:50,879
First

98
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,927
Sigil of mom and say hello to new walks

99
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:57,279
Bilbo Baggins boobs like you so much you're now policy walk

100
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,071
Thank you very much

101
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:05,983
Huddle's be Huntington the third by way of raptor princess backs thank you so much and I'll buzz you on

102
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:12,639
Next time I name is Christian Tom but not a boy named Tom who happens to

103
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,967
To be a Christian but rather a boy named Christian who happens to be a Tom

104
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,503
Thank you so much and I apologize

105
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:24,159
Text Jill my Canadian darling thank you so much

106
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,719
Thank you very much this worth

107
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:30,047
Said that they were moving to Chicago

108
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,375
Yeah I will say it for you

109
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
Sure

110
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,703
But not me because if you see me

111
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,055
You're probably my apartment

112
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:45,151
If I happen to be in Public Museum

113
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,175
Doughboy

114
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:50,783
Mets where do I type a funny message for Dan to read aloud so much you're now both

115
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,831
Thank you very much

116
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,111
That person called us

117
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,671
Car Talk of Alex Jones that I resent that

118
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:03,071
It's very annoying I named after the capital of Mongol golden horde in Europe because

119
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,911
Does your purse sounds as loud as 1,000 angry Horsemen riding Georgia city

120
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,471
To Burn It to the Ground

121
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,543
I'm a policy wonk house for a cat

122
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,919
So Jordan and a perfect world we would never have to talk about this stuff

123
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,943
Ever again

124
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,343
Yeah I was hoping that we were done damn the public would recognize that gay isn't saying anything new or interesting

125
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:31,743
Nick Fuentes is engaged in a large-scale political project publicity stunt bearded further mainstreaming Catholic

126
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,535
As a viable political entity

127
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,607
Are complicit in all of this

128
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:43,007
In a better world people would see these kinds of actions as disqualifying of these actors will be cast off the stage of public life

129
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,055
For the crime of being poor stewards

130
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,591
The public attention

131
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:51,967
But we live in a shity world and gay can spout anti-semitic ship for a month and none of this stops

132
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:58,111
In that time you didn't interview with Tucker Carlson that was so offensive the Tucker had to edit out large parts of it so

133
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:01,951
The clips that he did play match the narratives that he wanted to sell to his audience

134
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:07,583
He didn't interview with Tim pool where he stormed out after 20 minutes because pool wouldn't say that the Jews workout

135
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,351
Yay

136
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:15,007
He did a three-hour stretch on Infowars where you deny the Holocaust twice and constantly rebuke any of Alex's attempt

137
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,287
To help sanitize his

138
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,823
Clearly anti-Semitic bulshit

139
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,871
And all this

140
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:23,199
Is enough to make him a persona non grata in the right wing

141
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,247
Because there's still something they want from him

142
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:32,159
Like Nick Bay City utility and associating with a lunatic bigoted and there are two major reasons for that which were going to discuss

143
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,231
In Greater detail today through to recent shows

144
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,767
I mean just for fun

145
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,791
Listen to Nick

146
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,071
Should on Alex

147
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,095
Sorry

148
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:46,495
The first video is the one that Gavin McInnes put out which is supposed to be the first episode of

149
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,799
Who called saving ye

150
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:55,455
I'm not sure if that idea I think he has it for is like to be a series I don't know if that's a joke or not but

151
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,527
Haven't does say it at one point it seems like a kind of thing you would do

152
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:05,695
The second piece we're going to look at is an interview that Alex did on louder with Crowder where Crowder announce that alley

153
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:08,255
Which was breaking his silence on the gay interview

154
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,071
What does a really accurate but who cares

155
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:17,727
Each of these two documents illustrates one of the Dynamics that make ye and Nick's current media campaign incredibly in

156
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,287
Important for them to engage in and ultimately

157
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:25,151
Also reveal how bad of an idea it is for these right-wing figures to be getting

158
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:25,919
Involved at all

159
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:31,807
Apologies in advance for making you in the listeners here Gavin and Crowder's voices but in some ways it's not my fault

160
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:37,951
My fault I mean partially my fault

161
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:41,535
I accept some responsibility but just not all of it

162
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:47,935
So we're going to start with McGinnis a show and I want to say that I'm not going to cover most of the episode

163
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,983
Maybe I'll cover a bit but

164
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:56,383
He apparently is that copyright strikes again Hasan piker stream shut down for covering but that's not really

165
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,431
Concerned that's not really why I'm worried right

166
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:04,831
We're well within the territory of fair use and if Gavin wants to elevate our stature among his audience that really only works against his interests

167
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:11,743
Go fuc yourself I think he should have a joke off with me

168
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:18,143
I'm just not going to play a ton of the stuff that's in that episode partially because some of it is very repetitious of the stuff

169
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,191
But ye said on the Infowars interview

170
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:23,519
I meant a lot of it is just bad attempt on Gavin's part 2

171
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,335
Baby funny yeah and I don't really care to engage

172
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,639
With that necessarily

173
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,175
See that's the type of thing

174
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,711
That frustrates baby

175
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:35,551
Because if it was a MADtv sketching the 90s

176
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,087
That makes perfect sense like

177
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,927
Facsimile of Gavin McGinnis and effectively of yay

178
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,975
Doing a show together where it's like

179
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:48,863
I have to try and figure out how to make this incredibly famous black person not a white supremacist

180
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,911
How do I do this that's a mad tea

181
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:57,311
TV sketch of the 98 gang walk into a bar

182
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,079
Hundred percent

183
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,103
100%

184
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:06,015
This is the beginning or Gavin kind of gives a little bit of his

185
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,807
Is syllabus

186
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,855
I guess this is what he wants to achieve

187
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,927
Welcome to the first episode of saving yay

188
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,463
Where I am going to

189
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
Prevent

190
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,511
Jay West

191
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,535
From

192
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,071
Becoming an anti-semite

193
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
A Nazi

194
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,631
Going to talk him off the ledge

195
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,911
And bring them back to

196
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,471
The understanding that our problem is

197
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,495
Liberal Elites

198
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,263
Of all Races

199
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,287
Kamala Harris

200
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
This is a major problem

201
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,591
Barack Obama

202
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,127
What is a major Brock Obama is what

203
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:32,895
What started this whole mess

204
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,663
I would argue

205
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,199
Don't really into racist

206
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,223
Before he came along

207
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,039
Weather in say

208
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,343
Anti-Semitism is a run

209
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:45,183
So there's two important points here in this opening from Gavin

210
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:51,583
The first is that he has some kind of sense that racism really wasn't much of a thing before Obama at that isn't even something

211
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,399
Gavin believe there should be taken seriously

212
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,679
As appointees make

213
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:02,335
Racist audience that wants to believe that even if they have f***** up racist beliefs that are reported by the large

214
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,103
Population

215
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:07,199
They only have them because a black man became president made them become race

216
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,015
Obama was instigating the racism

217
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:14,623
He's a load of s*** there's actually something interesting about this formulation that he's put in for

218
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,927
When Obama became president

219
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:23,071
Create this new races on put a lot of people use racist ideas to contextualize their political opposition to Obama

220
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:28,191
In the time of his presidency the attacks on Obama intensified in terms of their races content

221
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:31,263
And a lot of that was because of the hard work of people like Alec

222
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:36,383
Racist ideas were Trojan Horse to the criticisms of Obama and the demagogue

223
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,479
Would insist they were racist at all they just didn't like the policies of this president

224
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
Wow being

225
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:48,415
Flagrantly races when they combined politics and racism

226
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:51,999
I'm into one thing it did not occur to them that later on they would come

227
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:56,351
Continue to be the same thing they thought they could take them away again they can take them apart again

228
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,375
Cocky

229
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:03,775
And over time he's racist ideas were more mainstream to the point where it was completely acceptable for Trump to make a name

230
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:07,103
Name for himself in politics by insisting Obama's birth certificate was fake

231
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:12,991
It was a normal thing for Alex to do stories about how he thought Michelle was a man and routinely called her Michael

232
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:17,087
People like Ted Nugent were heralded as legitimate people to take seriously

233
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,111
When he did things

234
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:21,439
Speculate that it would have been better if the South had won the Civil War

235
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,279
He said the black communities have a quote mindless tendency toward violence

236
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:32,191
During the Obama presidency the rise of the Tea Party the right-wing realized exploited the political capital of using races

237
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,495
To rile up their base to hate the black

238
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,055
So in those years it probably

239
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:40,383
Did feel like there was a whole new racism thing going on

240
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,783
But it was the product of the right-wing unleashing stuff that have been there for a long time and the product of gradual normalization

241
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,319
Carried out by media figures

242
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,599
Exactly like

243
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,879
Alex and Gavin

244
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,671
Play literally Alex himself

245
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,279
For example Alex

246
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:04,447
As we began this campaign of dealing with gay and Nick Fuentes they should really take a moment to reflect on how

247
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,727
F****** stupid it sound

248
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,031
Play the racism became a thing because of Obama

249
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:13,663
Unless I actually just trying to push Nazi s*** in which case they just keep doing what they're doing they're they're killing it

250
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,735
This brings me to the other point here

251
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,783
This is

252
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,063
This is important to understand

253
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,647
Kevin is not trying to talk ye out of being at peace Medical

254
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:28,767
He's engaging in exactly the same Fool's errand that Alex was trying at the end of last week

255
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:35,423
He's going to try to convince EA to use different words and pouches commented somewhat respectable and plausibly deniable

256
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,007
Language so they can get insanely Rich together while pushing hate

257
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,799
Yeah is an ink

258
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:47,199
Edible business opportunity for anyone who can manage to pull that off but none of these people seem to realize that he's not into

259
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,479
Twisted in that at all

260
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:53,087
Hiannick understand that's why people like Alex and Gavin are doing

261
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,671
They're not interested so they're essentially just showing up for the

262
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:01,279
Free publicity and to spread their hate message to whatever audience they can get in front of

263
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,863
Ye won't do this talk with Gavin where he's going to

264
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,679
Try and talk him off the ledge off camera

265
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,727
Because the only reason to do it

266
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,007
Is to do it publicly

267
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,383
And because it has to be done publicly Gavin has to use bulshit pretenses to approach the conversation

268
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:20,991
He can't just say hey we kind of anti-Semitic and we'll do a lot of business together

269
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,831
Just pretend that he's trying to talk you out of anti-semitism

270
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:28,415
If you watch this music Gavin has any sincere principled opposition

271
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:32,511
I have some oceanfront property in Arizona to sell you

272
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,071
At the Gorge

273
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,727
I'm not going to geography but I think that Arizona is land

274
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:48,383
It is that's a George Strait

275
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,455
Very clever

276
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:55,039
For some reason I thought it was headed in my head is

277
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,111
Oceanfront property in San Antone

278
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:05,535
And he's going to be in Amarillo by Amarillo by Morning

279
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:11,167
I'll promise

280
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,031
You give me looking for 8 when they pull that gate and I hope that judge ain't blind

281
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,079
Amarillo by Morning

282
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:24,991
Have a real excuse I can do wind you up towards singing

283
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:32,671
Lost my saddle

284
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,487
Here's a little bit more of Gavin discussing his pretence share

285
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,279
They're tenacious bunch

286
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,583
They are

287
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,119
Successful whites

288
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,935
I think Jews are doing well cuz it just whites it don't drink

289
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,983
I didn't drink I'd be president by now

290
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,799
So my goal here is just to get him

291
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,079
Out of

292
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:50,847
Beer

293
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,407
While he's in his which is the rut of ant

294
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,175
Semitism

295
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,455
Where is

296
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,759
If it rains on your birthday

297
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,551
You know we see this with track

298
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,087
In the hood going to

299
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:04,159
Whites are preventing me from doing anything

300
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:08,511
I can't be it I could go to school and get a PhD in accounting I never have a job because of race

301
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,791
So it's a crippling

302
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,559
Mentality

303
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:17,471
And it's not intellectually decided to actually adventurous to have a blame group and

304
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:23,871
Music done a lot of good things for all movements including like racial realism

305
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:30,271
Anyway to call order and he might shut me down but you got to try right got to try

306
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,599
Alright should we start

307
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:38,719
They say it's a hopeless fight but I say I got to try

308
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,791
8/8 for speeches like that

309
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,863
That the word defenestrate was created you know like

310
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:51,263
I don't think he's anywhere near window though he was in the car when he was recorded

311
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,567
You could throw right on the front windshield

312
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:59,967
I think it's a difficult that word created that word I swear to you

313
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:03,807
Picking up for car situations

314
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:07,135
It appears that Gavin's approaches going to evolve

315
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:13,535
Explaining to you that Jews aren't all that bad because there have been Jewish people who helped establish a school of pseudo-scientific

316
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,559
Racism

317
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,607
This seems like a solid plan

318
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:23,519
Do you think for a second that Nick hasn't rambled endlessly at Nick about race realest ideas

319
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,567
Big things

320
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:31,967
Nick is at the race realism he's got this base covered buddy hey come on yeah you can't hate the Jews that

321
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:35,295
Jews are racist to sometimes we can all do it

322
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:41,695
Brings us together I'm going to guess that Gavin's talking about folks Like Richard Herrnstein who was Douglas Murray

323
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,487
Co-author on the widely discredited book

324
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,255
The bell curve

325
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:47,327
Which is pretty foundational as a text for race realist

326
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:52,703
There may be other figures that he's thinking of too but whatever the case this is a losing point

327
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,495
To make for a wide audience

328
00:19:54,751 --> 00:20:00,895
Losing point if you want to try and bring this to ye as some kind of a way to reel him in Philly

329
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,687
It's just it's it's

330
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,967
Pathetic is a Prem

331
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,759
Because you're never going to be able to say

332
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,087
You're just not he's not selling to me right now

333
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,159
Obviously you're not going to convince the big guy I just

334
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,695
Watch go on Infowars

335
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,231
Deny the Holocaust

336
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:21,631
The anti-Semitism is bad that's not going to happen you know it and I know it and it's not going to happen on the show

337
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,751
Kevin might have a little hubris here because he might be drunk

338
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:30,591
He said he had a bloody mary I don't know if he had one

339
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:34,431
Well why didn't you know the normal amount of Bloody Mary's to drink is one

340
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,223
Like

341
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:43,135
10 in the morning unless you're at some brunch place that has like a flight

342
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:49,535
Bloody Mary's that maybe you want to try the spicy one

343
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:55,935
Interviews yay about anti-Semitism so you know we're dealing with a double-edged sword keep it in the bottomless

344
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,215
Mimosa territory

345
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:57,983
Yes

346
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:02,335
This this interview off and it it's

347
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,127
Similarities

348
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,431
Between now the way that

349
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,247
Are the attempts are rebuff

350
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,039
So this is

351
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,855
This is Saturday afternoon 2 days after the Infowars

352
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,647
And I was just

353
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,928
Telling you before we start

354
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,696
Filming it

355
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,256
We were watching it at home and

356
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,328
Ryan Iris looking each other about every 20 minutes with a cookie challenge

357
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,448
Like this is a big deal

358
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,496
We can use this method

359
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,288
And I think

360
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,848
What's a human being

361
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,128
Intercourse in the biggest react

362
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,664
The north positive one is

363
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,968
The craziest most punk rock things

364
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,992
The Sex Pistols

365
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,784
Got kicked off the bill Grundy show

366
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,832
But on the other end of the spectrum

367
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,368
Some people are saying this is

368
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,648
Bad breath

369
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,416
Presidential camp

370
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,720
Where do you stand on that

371
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,768
Think it's awesome for

372
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,072
Yeah if someone that's

373
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,120
Honest that understands

374
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,144
State of the world

375
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,704
And that's ready to

376
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,984
Listen to what the American

377
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,056
Hitler's got a pretty packed

378
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,360
Well who made that reputation

379
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,408
That was made by

380
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,200
Jewish people

381
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,992
Well the murdering

382
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,528
Is a pretty big toe

383
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,344
Yeah but some of it's incorrect

384
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,744
Oh boy

385
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,792
Are coming on this thing now

386
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:32,192
Also if you think you're going to come into an interaction with yeah it's a lot of people in

387
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,216
Anything or Adventure

388
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,776
Pointed off you're either a f****** idiot or you

389
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,080
You're carrying water for UA and his Hitler campaign

390
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,640
Gavin's first point that he wants to make

391
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:43,712
DEA is a compliment and then some subtle tone policing

392
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,576
He's calling the interview that he did with Alex punk-rock and then dropping a reminder that

393
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,112
His campaign

394
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,464
This is a classic approach of the you did a great job but here's how you do it better

395
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,816
Except the person he's talking to his comically Rich a million times more famous than Gavin

396
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:02,656
It doesn't give a s*** about his advice about how to do his racism better

397
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:06,752
Why the f*** would have ye take advice from Gavin on how to be a public racist

398
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:12,128
He's one of the most embarrassing examples of public races that we've seen come up in the last five or six years

399
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:15,200
Easy easy easy easy embarrassment to the races

400
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:20,576
Yeah I mean it seems very difficult to take advice from somebody

401
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,600
Like

402
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:22,624
Kevin

403
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:23,904
Whenever

404
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,440
Your

405
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,208
Super

406
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:26,976
Famous

407
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,000
Wearing a mask

408
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:31,840
Person just wondering on to places telling people to Hitler is cool

409
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:34,144
They still invite you on Via

410
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,032
And you're just some assholes who invented Vice and then everybody hates you forever and now you're the guy who

411
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,568
Did the proud boys

412
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:47,968
You you are somebody who's going around and making a campaign of being a completely

413
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,992
Anti-Semitic

414
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,784
Call Augusta 9 piece of s***

415
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,600
And people are still inviting you onto their shows

416
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,368
And

417
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,136
Ura

418
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:55,904
You think

419
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:02,304
Fit for a second that person is going to take the advice of the person who's still inviting them on the show I mean it's ridiculous

420
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,352
Little bit it is a little bit like

421
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:10,752
You know that's that relationship where you fall in love with somebody but then the more you're with them you more you're like

422
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:17,152
Oh you should wear this and all you should wear this and then five years later it's a different person and you wonder why you don't love them anymore

423
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:23,552
It's because you're trying to change the thing that made you want them in the first place and that is that ye loved Hitler

424
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:28,672
That's why you invited him on you can't change his mind he won't come on your show

425
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,976
Right

426
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,512
And also it's not really punk rock

427
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:37,120
I mean like his example is like the Sex Pistols getting kicked off a show you didn't get kicked off the show

428
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:41,728
Do anything goes really that transgressive except a public opinion

429
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,264
Alexandria Lee

430
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,056
Have that much of a problem with it

431
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:51,712
I just have to say Nazi punks f*** off I feel like that's the most punk-rock thing you can say that's fair enough

432
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,504
Apparently

433
00:24:54,016 --> 00:25:00,160
Yeah it has expanded the sphere of influence that the Jews have over Society we all know the

434
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:03,232
Well we know that there's lie classic tropes

435
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,792
Of the banks in Hollywood and stuff

436
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:09,376
But apparently there's more that that's under the control

437
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,424
Jewish people control

438
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,728
The majority of the media

439
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,008
Along with

440
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:15,776
Bags

441
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,312
Along with the realest

442
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,080
Steak

443
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,360
Along with

444
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,944
Amol

445
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:27,552
They can control the narrative black history is written by the winners

446
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,368
They're upset that

447
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,648
Hitler was kicking them

448
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,672
Out of the country

449
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:36,256
By the time I mean the Holocaust was only 250,000 Jews

450
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,280
Left

451
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,816
But really diving into it here

452
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,120
I mean yeah that's getting to real information

453
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,680
You know what did they think we're going to happen

454
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,216
Matter fact that's like

455
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:48,288
I think the I think the Jews are like really

456
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,824
I think the Jewish like me

457
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,128
Sade and Rahm Emmanuel and

458
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,176
Bibi Netanyahu and

459
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,968
All of them I think they really got

460
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:56,736
Soft out here

461
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,528
Like I'm getting to walk around and say to

462
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,552
The truth out loud

463
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,576
You know

464
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,648
Elastic I'm dropping headphone

465
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,280
Really fun to learn that apparently malls are an anti-semitic conspiracy trigger

466
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,816
I want that to the pile

467
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,096
Shopping malls

468
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,632
You know

469
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:18,496
This is the thing that it seems like on its faces is just easy to see through like

470
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:22,592
Okay you're telling me that Jews control all of that stuff

471
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,432
But everytime I see people who actually control it

472
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:32,832
They won't shut the f****** about how they control it like Mall Barons railroad Barons all these guys are constantly like

473
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:35,648
We f****** on this s*** do what you say

474
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,952
I haven't seen anybody do that

475
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:41,024
V the mall thing it has to do with

476
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,584
Have to piece this together from Context Clues

477
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,608
A various ringgit

478
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,144
Everybody's been going on

479
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,240
If you wanted to have like a retail shop

480
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:53,824
He wanted to be like to have a store that I put in malls

481
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,640
Okay and apparently somebody at some

482
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,944
Corporation was like a trial

483
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,344
We'll run one and you didn't think that was big enough he wanted to be all over the place and have his own store

484
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,976
He's blaming the Jews for that I can escape room but at the end of every clue it's the Jews fault

485
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:17,632
Yeah I think it he would solve it very quickly because it was that fix like that was with the escape room was

486
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,400
Norfolk WIC

487
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,704
I think that you should reflect on what he say

488
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:23,776
You think that Mossad and Netanyahu have gotten soft

489
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:27,872
Because I haven't killed him yet and maybe it's not that anyone's gotten soft

490
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,664
Hitman game believes an anti-Semitic

491
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,968
Conspiracy to anyone who questions the Jews gets

492
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,272
Killed by their amazing assassination team

493
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,832
Maybe people are killed for being bigot

494
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:41,440
It's consistently obsessed with how someone is going to kill them for speaking their false truths

495
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:48,352
A larger point is that yay is once again engaging in Holocaust denial and getting no pushback from the people hosting him to Harper's

496
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,376
Assumably there

497
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,680
To talk him out of his anti-semitism

498
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:58,592
The census that was taken in Germany in June 1933 but the Jewish population of Germany at approximately 5

499
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,128
505000 people

500
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:06,272
This was when the Nazis took power and in the intervening years many Jewish people did flee but no matter

501
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,320
What number you site for the Jewish population

502
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,088
Germany

503
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,464
It's important to remember that the Nazis were expansionist and they held territory Beyond 1 countries borders

504
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,024
Notably the Nazis occupied Polo

505
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,096
What were the population of Jews went from 3.3 million

506
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,400
To approximately 380,000

507
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,680
After the war

508
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:30,336
It seems pretty clear here that gay has gotten some pretty Elementary basic Holocaust denial memes and talking points Moe's

509
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,360
Most likely from Nick

510
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:37,760
And now he's going to go on a campaign of repeating them as loudly as he can whenever he's given a chance to talk

511
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,296
On the scam

512
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,856
Don't realize it's not a scam

513
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:45,184
And they're being useful idiots to help anti-Semitism spread

514
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:47,488
It says it's really

515
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,280
Bad

516
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,864
Yeah yeah it feels it feels like

517
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,400
They are

518
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,960
So dumb

519
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,520
But in in a way of like

520
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,080
Well we're just doing what we were

521
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:02,848
Always do

522
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:09,248
This is what we do

523
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:15,136
And you're supposed to be doing the thing and despite the fact that they've seen other people fail they keep going to him and being like well

524
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,440
Obviously but that's cuz Alex sucks

525
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,976
Gavin McInnes

526
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,024
I created the proud boys

527
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:27,424
I'm going to make a series of time today yay off of the ledge that he's not on like he's not on the way

528
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:33,824
No he's he's flying that's the problem he's falling down and nobody is if there's no ground

529
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,432
The jokes are you Gavin the point is what he hits the ground

530
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,712
It's going to hurt a lot

531
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,504
And not just him

532
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,272
No

533
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,576
So Gavin has some thoughts

534
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,112
Aidan Kerr

535
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,648
I'm going to have an intervention

536
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,440
Are you and Nick

537
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,976
Let me just

538
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,512
Yes

539
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,536
There are

540
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:57,376
Almost eighty to ninety percent of Hollywood

541
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,400
Probably more

542
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:02,496
What's your name yeah I'm going to say like Katie

543
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,264
Percent of media

544
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,288
It is Jewish

545
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,824
But

546
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,640
I mean I see the Jews were talking about in these

547
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,664
These cases as

548
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,432
Liberally

549
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,480
High IQ people

550
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:13,504
White

551
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:17,344
And when you have like a there just before she represented in medicine

552
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,112
Into

553
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,392
Because they have high IQs

554
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,184
So the problem isn't these

555
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,000
These Jews that most of them are secular Jews atheist

556
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,024
I don't see Soros

557
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,792
Jewish

558
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:28,864
So we have the secular mostly atheist

559
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,424
Require

560
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:34,496
There are overrepresented in chess in mathematic

561
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:39,360
Text to wish you here and there is no masochism there is some sort of like let's burn it

562
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,432
But I think that trait is a white

563
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,712
Trade a liberal Elite

564
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:44,736
White tree

565
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:47,040
Not even

566
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,344
Kamala Harris Barack Obama they also have these

567
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:52,928
And there's some sort of like lemon DNA

568
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,000
In white people wear when they reach a certain medicine

569
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,024
Success they just want to

570
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,792
Take it off a cliff

571
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,120
And I don't like when Jews get pulled into that because

572
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:04,960
When I think it was my Orthodox Jewish friends and an even my

573
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,728
Hasidic friend

574
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,032
These people are conservative Trump

575
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:08,800
Supporting

576
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,848
You do American Patriot

577
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:15,200
And the Jews are getting lumped in with this sort of ethnomasochism

578
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,992
Cultural suicide

579
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:20,320
And not really to be Jewish I call them johno's Jews in name only

580
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,856
It's literally whites

581
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,624
You should have a beef with

582
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,672
Yeah but I love them all in together

583
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,440
That's what I did

584
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:28,768
Jewish

585
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,608
Okay but

586
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,632
Straight like

587
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:34,912
You know

588
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:37,216
Blacks are overrepresented in violent crime

589
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,264
But when you meet an individual black

590
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:43,104
Person you don't apply that you start with a fresh slate every time you meet

591
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,128
Do you do that with

592
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,152
With juice

593
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:55,904
Hahaha

594
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,928
Beans is it an intervention

595
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:03,584
No not even the slightest bet you you and yourself in your quest for like well yeah obviously due to the problem but it's not

596
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,864
Like 100%

597
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:11,264
It's like 85 we can be cool rights and let's call it the liberal Elites

598
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,968
Ironic considering what we're talking about

599
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,992
And it's just like

600
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:26,624
Yeah. Give a s*** these games with him he's saying what he saying

601
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,744
Like the only people who seem to not be accepting what the reality of this is

602
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,280
Are people like Alex

603
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,584
Reflecting pool table I Gavin

604
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,608
Answer because

605
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:39,424
They want that business opportunity

606
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,240
It comes from yay moderating is message

607
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,800
And becoming part of their business and their revenues to

608
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,640
I mean the unspoken question that they can never have

609
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,456
Because it's too obvious is the

610
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,480
Well

611
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,504
Yes yeah

612
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:56,320
You are pointing out what racism is to us

613
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,368
And we also understand that

614
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,904
But what you're missing

615
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,208
Is that

616
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,000
Even we aren't racist

617
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,280
We just want money

618
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:09,120
You understand

619
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:14,240
For sure we also a little bit more important to run the scam

620
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,776
And keep that moving

621
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:23,968
We prioritize running to scam through facilitating and pushing racism but there is a point

622
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:29,088
Which it crosses a line and it is no longer good for business what I'm saying is

623
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,136
We're trying to tell you gay

624
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,416
That despite

625
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,696
Racism

626
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,232
Being an absolute

627
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,256
You know

628
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,024
You believe

629
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,304
That races are ripped

630
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,840
And that's in arguing

631
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:40,864
Right

632
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,680
We don't actually believe that

633
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:47,264
Are believes are fungible based on benefit for us person

634
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,336
So well you think that racism is important

635
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,384
Weaving money's important

636
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,688
And then we'll lie about racism

637
00:33:55,456 --> 00:34:01,600
The only thing I take issue with his I do think there's still a sincere interest in racism

638
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:08,000
It's not all just because it's advantageous with a business

639
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,816
I'm talking to gay is gay is being a racist

640
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:17,216
Right he's not using coded language he's not trying to hide it whatsoever and that means that when you talk to him

641
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,288
If he says no I love them all in together you're supposed to say

642
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,568
That's how it goes

643
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,848
That's what race is

644
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,896
That's what we're doing

645
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,432
Instead he somehow being like listen

646
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:30,272
All Jews are bad except for like 5% see I'm not racist

647
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:34,368
And and as you were sort of react

648
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:40,768
Into like I get to determine who

649
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:47,168
I can make up my own distinctions that allow me to argue that I'm not actually the thing ever

650
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:52,288
True Scotsman applies to you on everything

651
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,312
Yeah

652
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:59,712
So look I think there is an issue where we're just not going to necessarily

653
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:01,504
Call out

654
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,856
Discuss every single stupid thing that gay or Gavin says

655
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:09,440
So apologies in advance for that

656
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:13,024
Here's just some grievances that ye has it I think they're kind of dumb

657
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:17,376
And my mom was a liberal and she went to a state school call Chicago State

658
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,912
They gave her job there

659
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:21,472
And put me on a put it on a

660
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:24,032
Southside of Chicago on 79th Street

661
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,080
My experience

662
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,128
Right is brought me to be the

663
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,968
Rich's you know black man about town a multi-billionaire

664
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,808
And the people at Adidas they wouldn't even take meetings with me

665
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,624
And I was 68% of their online sales

666
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,904
And brought Adidas bag

667
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:43,744
And then I when I was in the Kardashian family I have no say-so on

668
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,328
Where we had Christmas there was only one time that even got to design

669
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,608
The Christmas party

670
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,912
What why is this in your list of complaints

671
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:56,032
The family that I decide the Christmas party adopt

672
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,056
Yep

673
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,336
What

674
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:00,896
Yeah yeah I've I'm a little petty

675
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,688
I just don't think we should

676
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,480
Convince people that they are the Messiah

677
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:10,112
I just don't think we should do it anymore I think we should try and bring it back

678
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:15,744
Bad move problems for not just you but everyone reading

679
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:19,072
So there's a collusion going on

680
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,376
According to

681
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:26,496
These folk in this interview and apparently the pornography obsession

682
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,032
Comes back of course

683
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,384
We are beings with engineering opportunities there's a lot of culture

684
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,712
But we got to just clean that out we got to say okay for fat

685
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,736
Dares

686
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:37,504
A

687
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:41,600
Collusion of Jewish attorneys managers

688
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,648
And everything else you can think of

689
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:46,464
They don't abort their children

690
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,512
They only marry within their tribe

691
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,072
Right and then they'll give

692
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,352
America

693
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,632
P*** not yes

694
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,656
Black people

695
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,680
But poor white people

696
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,472
And Mexican people

697
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:00,032
They do things that use p***

698
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:03,616
In war this like a gas want to talk about gas Chambers

699
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:06,688
This is a gas chamber it's a silent killer

700
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,736
And it's illegal and they put it on

701
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:10,016
Every single block

702
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,064
Any use my ex-wife to sell it

703
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:16,672
And they also they want a dumbass download

704
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:19,232
Incredible individual speak for a second

705
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,792
Put my hand back in the Bible

706
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,096
Jews suffer

707
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:29,728
From pouring the same way everyone else does

708
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,264
Step

709
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,640
This is right out of the anti-semitic narrative

710
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,408
Textbook

711
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:40,992
I guess David Michael Jones certainly one of The Inspirations for

712
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,016
Fuentes

713
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,832
And Owen Benjamin and Milo yiannopoulos

714
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,624
People all within

715
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,928
Oh and Ali Alexander

716
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,000
All the people who are in

717
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:58,400
Gays orbit currently are all followers and admirers of e Michael Jones who one of his big claim

718
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:03,776
He's arguing that Jews use pornography as a weapon against Western

719
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,568
Yep culture so I mean he's just

720
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,848
Spouting that off

721
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:09,920
And instead of understanding really what's going on

722
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:12,224
Gavin is like yes

723
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,760
Pornography so bad

724
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,808
And the reason you saying that I mean

725
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:20,928
I guess he's kind of in that camp to maybe he doesn't interpreter experience it is

726
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:22,976
Narrative and talk

727
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,352
Requirements to get into the boys if you can't beat off

728
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,120
So

729
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,656
Ghetto music

730
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:33,472
He's an old hat in these these Waters

731
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,008
Yeah

732
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,288
Did the name cereals

733
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,360
Got your dick I just I mean just

734
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,664
I'm so annoyed

735
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,200
I'm so annoyed whenever people can't

736
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,224
Just be like listen

737
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
If you

738
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,832
Expand your Sexual Energy we think you won't have enough

739
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,880
Could you killing for what we want you to do

740
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:51,904
Do you understand

741
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,184
So you can't jerk off

742
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,720
You need that energy at 8

743
00:38:54,976 --> 00:39:01,120
To kill people with being a strength

744
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:04,192
The see-through and it's Milton nobody's ever had this idea in the past

745
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,752
This is a good

746
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,032
But

747
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,568
Gavin

748
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:13,152
Asks about what what do you do about these

749
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:16,480
You know like these problems that you see

750
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:22,624
Chozen I yell out losers about it not nut what are you doing what would you do

751
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,928
Yeah

752
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,976
The main issue is that

753
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,256
Christ is King

754
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:31,072
Christ is the true king of Israel

755
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:33,120
Christ is the king of all Kings

756
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,424
If you don't believe in Jesus Christ

757
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,704
You are wrong

758
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:39,520
Anyone that doesn't believe in Jesus Christ

759
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,544
Should not be

760
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,896
In control or in any influence to anything that America producer

761
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,432
Vietmedia

762
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,480
Technology politics

763
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,504
Farming

764
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,784
Medicine

765
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,808
Prison

766
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:57,952
If you do not believe in Christ and you're not following Christ in the decisions that you make you should have no influence on that

767
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,072
Well that's going to be a tough thing Institute so it's still your president United States

768
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,632
That the Hitler thing does not hurt your campaign

769
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,472
Okay how's your campaign

770
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,264
It's day one and they go

771
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,544
Someone watching Lego

772
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,080
So what are we to do with these Jews

773
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,128
What do you say

774
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,664
What do you mean do about

775
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:24,576
They're overly represented in met lots of people who don't believe in Christ

776
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,600
Probably wager

777
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,392
Then your average Hospital in New York

778
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,952
Maybe a third or less

779
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:30,720
Believe In Christ

780
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,024
So are you suggesting we get rid of

781
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,304
Two-thirds of the doctors

782
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:37,632
Not getting rid of like not violently get rid of them

783
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,984
I think that Jews are very intelligent

784
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:46,848
But they don't deserve to be in charge of everything because they don't put Christ

785
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,664
How do you legislate that

786
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,944
They need to work for Chris

787
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:54,016
You should work for Christians I'll hire a Jewish person

788
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:54,784
In a second

789
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,368
If I knew they weren't a spy and I can look through their phone and follow to the house and have a

790
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:02,976
Camera living room

791
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:05,792
This isn't a joke

792
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:11,424
But they're all laughing because if they didn't have to take what ye saying seriously and he couldn't handle that

793
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:18,080
This is directly aligned with things that ye and Nick have said in the past so I don't believe this isn't a sincerely held View

794
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:23,456
There anyone who doesn't believe in Jesus the same way that they do should have no place of influence in society

795
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:30,368
They're discussing create a stratified Society with a broad

796
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:34,464
Underclass of people who are ineligible to run businesses hold public office

797
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,488
Oran balls

798
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,512
Presumably

799
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:39,072
The things that ye is advocating for abhorrent

800
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:44,448
Any right-thinking person who cares about the ideals of Freedom individuality and small government the way they

801
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:46,240
Folks like Gavin pretend to

802
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:49,312
If the easiest thing to push back on to and yet

803
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:53,919
Diamond doesn't really do so effectively and I think that's probably because he wants the same thing just

804
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:58,783
Maybe with a differently worded definition of Who belongs in that marginalized underclass

805
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:05,439
In some sense games refusal to relent on anything has the effect of revealing how little the people he's talking to really but

806
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:08,255
They may be pretty loud about loving the concert

807
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:14,655
Institution when they're on their own but they don't love it enough to fight within a really famous person suggesting the Jews shouldn't be allowed to

808
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,935
Working government jobs

809
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:20,031
There are too many things that could go wrong and ye might walk out on gas

810
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:22,079
It's just absurd one of his supposed

811
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,615
Series and you don't want that

812
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:30,015
In that situation it's best just to laugh at the suggestions you can pretend later that he didn't really mean it in the joke's on me

813
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:33,343
Damn the guy listening to this cuz I took it seriously

814
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,623
But

815
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:38,463
You ain't sitting there with Nick Fuentes you if you need a reminder set

816
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,743
This in October

817
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:42,559
If you have

818
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:44,863
No problem with me

819
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,399
Newsflash and every

820
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,263
If you hate Jesus

821
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,287
You have a problem

822
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,591
Straight up

823
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,127
Hotel near elitches

824
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,151
Or whatever

825
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:58,943
Question

826
00:42:59,199 --> 00:42:59,711
Do you hate

827
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:05,599
Oh no

828
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,391
Especially if

829
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,159
A problem if you have

830
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:12,767
It's my job.

831
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:15,583
Amarillo

832
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,631
I'm not just one of these

833
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,679
Do you want our our job is

834
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,311
So don't tell me

835
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,079
They're entitled

836
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,871
Their religion involves

837
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:28,639
My

838
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,919
Lord and how

839
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,295
So far is that

840
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,439
Anywhere near

841
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:44,767
Who do you serve

842
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:54,239
This is clearly position that these dudes have and it's something that should be taken very seriously

843
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:59,103
These aren't the kinds of ideas you have fun conversations about new have to consider both sides

844
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,175
It's and if you think that's what you're doing The Joke is on You

845
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,199
Gavin

846
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:08,575
You know what Nikki saying that stuff like you believe my Lord is it burning in hell

847
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,623
That's his view of

848
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:18,047
That's not like he loves them all together is like

849
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,839
It's so like this is

850
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:22,911
This is something that if allowed to

851
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,959
Come anywhere near having

852
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:28,543
Political influence of their own is a priority for them

853
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:31,359
The marginalization of

854
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:35,711
Particularly Jewish people but then also anyone who isn't a Christian

855
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:40,575
According to their definition of Christianity eligible for all sorts of things

856
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,623
Whether it be owning a business

857
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,671
I would imagine teaching

858
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:47,743
You know

859
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:54,143
Right close to being able to make decisions that affect Christians

860
00:44:54,655 --> 00:45:00,799
Yeah I mean it it was it's almost impossible to imagine a scenario like this one unless you were to look at

861
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:03,615
American history from anywhere from you know like 20 years back

862
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,151
And then keep going

863
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,687
That's essentially the same thing

864
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,223
At this time

865
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,247
Specific

866
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,551
It's it's a really

867
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:13,343
Messed up stuff and

868
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,647
Yeah I didn't feel like there's a great push

869
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:23,071
It's him being at Gabriel I got another Holocaust didn't happen and him being like what would you do if you had control it'll be like

870
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,887
Culturally holocaust-themed uh-huh I would make steps

871
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:32,287
That advanced towards another one

872
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,055
Would happen

873
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:37,151
That is why I'm telling you that when I would do it it wouldn't happen

874
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:40,223
To make has an interesting thought here and by interesting I mean pathetic

875
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:43,551
You look at white kids there's nothing I don't think

876
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,087
Intrinsic and white people that may

877
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,111
And hate themselves

878
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,903
Like when I was a kid

879
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,439
Kids love Hitler

880
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:55,839
In the sense that we see the videos we see the propaganda and the symbols and there's something compelling about it

881
00:45:56,095 --> 00:46:00,447
When you were little kid like 8 years old

882
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:06,591
He Frets like Hitler

883
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,663
That's a pretty revealing and sad clip

884
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:14,271
Make a singer when he was younger kids his age and his evidence is 4chan

885
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:17,343
I've some bad news about those people Nick thinks were kids

886
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:20,415
They were adults who were trying to spread racist memes

887
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:23,743
The trick kids into thinking there was something cool and compelling about the not for you

888
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,279
This is kind of

889
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:29,887
You're saying this out loud to be an embarrassment for Nikki should you should feel bad

890
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:30,655
Yeah

891
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:31,935
Jesus

892
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:34,751
Yep

893
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:41,663
That's who listen when I was growing up it was super cool to wear a white hood and a white cloak and everybody

894
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:46,015
Play seems like that's crazy now and then I found out that I was just growing up inside the Klan

895
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,807
And that was not a generalized

896
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:48,575
Experience

897
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,879
And said I was a cosplaying loser

898
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:56,255
I was hanging out in a Nazi adjacent forum

899
00:46:56,511 --> 00:47:02,655
So when I was growing up I was Highland Hitler like 1620 times a day

900
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,447
Could not Heil Hitler in that case

901
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,775
Maybe self-selected

902
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:13,919
Here's a good example of why you can't really argue with people like Nick

903
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:16,223
There's no way

904
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,783
By the way who are The Architects of Blackness

905
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:19,807
People always point

906
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:20,575
The finger at culture

907
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,343
Marxism

908
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:24,671
Cultural Marxist got kicked out of Germany by Hitler

909
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,951
Because they were Jewish

910
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,487
And atheist

911
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:28,255
2

912
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,279
Like marks

913
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,303
Soros

914
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:35,167
Soros's Dad they were all atheist you're helping him can do the sabotage

915
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,191
You're going to see a disc

916
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:38,495
Proportionate number of people don't believe in God

917
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:43,359
Well but there's something about Judaism to though that it's not just that they don't believe

918
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:44,383
Even God but they

919
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,151
They don't believe in

920
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,175
Christ

921
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:49,247
I think that's so much of our atheist Society is

922
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,271
Really a product of

923
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,807
Judaism they're really kind of like

924
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:52,831
The first atheist

925
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:53,855
See

926
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:54,623
See

927
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,671
This is why you can't argue

928
00:47:57,183 --> 00:48:03,071
You start off with Nick suggesting that Jewish people are responsible for creating leftism

929
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:06,399
Now Gavin tries to rub but this and argue

930
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,703
Sort of robotics

931
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:15,103
Yeah I was going to say

932
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:15,871
Alex

933
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:22,271
This is atheists this is the real issue

934
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:27,391
To give a shiny coat of paint on top of Nick's old races

935
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:29,183
Anti-semitism

936
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,231
And of course the rebuttal is

937
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:37,887
Jews made atheist I mean no matter what there's just going to be another Avenue that takes you to the place where Nick wants

938
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:44,287
He can absorb your argument and then put a layer on top of it that is aha guess what you don't read

939
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,335
Realize that the thing that you're pointing to

940
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,871
Exactly

941
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:50,431
Yeah yeah it's it's it's

942
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,199
Insane

943
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:54,527
It's insane that they are pretending like they don't understand but

944
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,551
Kanye

945
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,319
Nick safe

946
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:59,391
What we lump them all in together that's the point

947
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:04,767
Lego athenee and they seem almost slightly incredulous to that

948
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:05,535
Concept

949
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,303
Up like

950
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:13,215
No that's what you're that's what you do that's the point if that's what racism is it slipping the ball into got do you not understand

951
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,775
So

952
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:16,799
Gavin

953
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:22,431
Seadek have you would solve other issues and an a cause of the Jewish problem which is a

954
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:29,087
You know that's certainly I believe he does

955
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:32,415
Sort of signaling to not the ideas

956
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:35,999
But whatever the case Nick's idea isn't good

957
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:40,863
What do you say Nick if you guys are President vice-president you're too young to know what I mean hypothetically

958
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,911
How do you Institute this

959
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:45,727
When that is signaling the Jew problem

960
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,543
Well I would medicine for example

961
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:53,407
Well I would pass I think in medicine is less of an issue through the real issue is communication

962
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,431
Because

963
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,711
Mass communication

964
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,247
Change the world forever

965
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,527
100 years ago and parts

966
00:49:58,783 --> 00:49:59,807
Take a lily 30 years ago

967
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:02,623
We need to have Christian standard guiding that

968
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,903
Because the goal of our

969
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:04,671
Society

970
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:06,463
Is to be moving people into

971
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:08,767
Maybe have atheists

972
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:11,583
Whether they're Jewish or white running the media

973
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:12,607
It doesn't facilitate

974
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,399
How do you fix that

975
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:21,311
Even even if you can't say we're going to have the government come in and fire all the Jews running the media

976
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:24,895
What type of lawmakers make laws that govern the media

977
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:27,711
We don't want pornography on the internet

978
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:30,015
That we don't want pornography frankly anywhere

979
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,551
We don't want indecency

980
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:32,575
We want

981
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:33,599
That's fine

982
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:35,391
That doesn't do it like

983
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:38,207
Let's just have open Free Speech no one can get canceled

984
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,999
And now there's no more problems

985
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:40,767
Control

986
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:44,095
It shouldn't be something the Gavin says that's fine too

987
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:49,983
Even if he's okay with the cancer is anti-Semitic beliefs Nick is throwing at him he should not be fine with the prescription of

988
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:52,287
Decency standards enforced by the government

989
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,847
Like how do you think his show would Fair

990
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:56,383
Against decency standard

991
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:59,199
Kevin has a podcast called free speech

992
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:01,247
Which which is essentially the tire branding

993
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:04,319
He can't just meekly accept a fast-talking Nazi

994
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,343
Becoming on his show

995
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:10,207
And I'm saying that the government needs to Crush free speech just because I guess they don't like pornos

996
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,231
But doesn't work

997
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:15,071
Kevin had another show called free-speech two different shows

998
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:17,631
We're in this one was already tried to book a liberal in it

999
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:18,655
Conservative to chat

1000
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,935
Eschews

1001
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:26,335
Episode Cowboy Rambo Joe Biggs as we conservative gas who is now facing charges of sedition

1002
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,103
Conspiracy

1003
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,127
Regarding his involvement

1004
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:28,895
January 6th

1005
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:34,015
Really cool though for Gavin to book one of the leaders of his street gang as a guest on his show

1006
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,295
Really giving back

1007
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:42,207
Nick is advocating for a Theocratic society which is antithetical to the Constitution and everything these right-wing s******* spurt

1008
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:42,975
Santa value

1009
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:49,631
If they want to pretend to be all taller into not offended by racism and anti-Semitism think it's still push back on this stuff

1010
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:56,543
It would just be in the battle in the war of ideas and what-have-you they don't really even do that

1011
00:51:57,311 --> 00:52:00,639
Gavin's response to what Nick is saying is essentially a non sequitur

1012
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:05,759
Her folks like him free speech has become such a catch phrase that it kind of has lost any meaning

1013
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:12,415
He's trying to argue with a yes and a guy who sang that Free Speech should be destroyed by saying

1014
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,951
Free speech

1015
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:20,351
Kevin is used to dealing with jethead grifting types Who hide their two ideas behind universally acceptable terms like free speech

1016
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:25,727
He's not really prepared to talk to a smart young man who's ready to just torpedo the pretenses

1017
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:27,263
And say the quiet part

1018
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,287
Incredibly loud

1019
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:32,127
Gavin has left us trying to look after the wreckage of those pretenses

1020
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:34,943
Cuz he's just trying to like cleanup and he looks like a fuking idiot

1021
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:35,967
I I mean

1022
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:38,783
I find it so absurd

1023
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:39,551
Tell like

1024
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,135
Simultaneously read about the

1025
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,415
Continuing

1026
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:46,463
The ongoing protests

1027
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:48,255
Fighting in Iran

1028
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:51,327
I thought the murders the execution

1029
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,887
Like all of this s*** is going on

1030
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:56,703
And then to hear the f******

1031
00:52:56,959 --> 00:53:03,103
Baby Ayatollah show up on Gavin McGinnis Ashok of calling for decency laws

1032
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:05,407
It is insane

1033
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:07,199
And it's it's it's

1034
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:09,759
Outrageous to think

1035
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:10,783
Gavin

1036
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:11,807
Isn't like

1037
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:12,831
More

1038
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:13,599
Like

1039
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:15,647
We got it we got to dig into this one

1040
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:22,047
Decency standards is not decent

1041
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:24,607
Branches of Christianity would have

1042
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,631
Sort of different

1043
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:29,983
Particularities about what is priority for absolutely

1044
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:36,895
I was just screwing so wildly I threw my vape

1045
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,175
A vape tank

1046
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,967
Call God

1047
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:40,735
Alright

1048
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:43,551
Everything

1049
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:46,623
Yeah it's it's a it's a little bulshit

1050
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:48,159
I I just

1051
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:54,303
That I don't know how it is possible for you to even pretend to call yourself a comedian

1052
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:56,607
And then listen to somebody say

1053
00:53:56,863 --> 00:54:01,471
I think we should have decency laws and go you know what that's not a bad idea

1054
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:07,871
I think Lenny Bruce should have been arrested in prison cultures

1055
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:14,271
I'm sick of people saying you can't say this I want people who swear to go to jail

1056
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:16,063
Jail I don't want these woke

1057
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:20,415
People complaining about things that are I want

1058
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,695
Basically theocrats

1059
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:24,511
Arresting people

1060
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,047
Oh my God

1061
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,071
Great work

1062
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:31,167
So I thought this was really funny and then

1063
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:34,239
Scary some stuff has to say

1064
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:36,287
How do I say f a

1065
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,055
Instagram in the car

1066
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:44,479
Screw Instagram

1067
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:46,015
I think we can stay in a better way

1068
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,295
Here we go

1069
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,343
Pray for Instagram

1070
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:53,951
Pray for Instagram pray for the Instagram users right because Instagram

1071
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:56,255
Is a platform and because there's

1072
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,279
So many

1073
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:58,815
Predator

1074
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:01,119
Online anyone

1075
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,143
That light

1076
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,679
A photo

1077
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:04,959
A woman

1078
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:07,007
That's half naked

1079
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,799
A string of her butt

1080
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,591
Is a sexual predator

1081
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:13,919
Yep yep

1082
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:14,687
Sure

1083
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,991
Show us your browser history by

1084
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:23,135
Wonderful husband maybe you should have Bloody Mary

1085
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:26,719
GreatCall sure everybody who likes a picture on it

1086
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:28,511
Instagram is a sexual predator

1087
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:35,679
How many grams is a lot of people don't have a lot of experience on Instagram but I know I hear a lot of people talking about sliding in DMs

1088
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:36,703
And stuff and I think

1089
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:39,007
We are a lot of people who harass a lot of folks

1090
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:41,567
Liking a picture

1091
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:45,151
Is not the equivalent deal with that

1092
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,943
That look different conversation

1093
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:49,503
Way back to just all sex

1094
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:55,647
Pastore happening across this great land of ours I think

1095
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:57,183
Auto deer

1096
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:58,463
F****** daily basis

1097
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:04,095
That's that's a fair point you just want to talk about

1098
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,375
Unnamed

1099
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,655
Faceless

1100
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:11,007
Women he can objectify and then use as an object

1101
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:13,567
To get what he wants

1102
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:15,359
Like pornography

1103
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:21,503
So also I I do appreciate the pretty making it a little bear that

1104
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:25,599
Pray for means f*** you

1105
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:31,487
Pure Heart

1106
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:36,863
Love everyone that's been a big part of his whole campaign

1107
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:41,471
It's what makes him saying I love Hitler so it's

1108
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:42,751
You know

1109
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:45,823
True according to Heaven Nick

1110
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:47,103
Who makes it

1111
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:53,503
Possible but he's hot he hides behind that idea like I'm saying I love everyone you know

1112
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:59,903
This is a little bit disingenuous and all but maintained that Jews are a second-class citizens

1113
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:06,303
It must be serving us at all times and we have to serve a limb otherwise that I love everybody

1114
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:09,631
That's what it comes down to it there's an abstract idea of love

1115
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:10,399
But

1116
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:13,471
Now when we talk about how things are going to run

1117
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:15,775
Maybe it's not to threaten

1118
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:17,311
I love

1119
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,079
Everyone

1120
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:19,359
I love

1121
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,663
Black white straight

1122
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:22,687
Gay rich

1123
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,455
Poor

1124
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,503
Jewish

1125
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:29,087
The follow God's ins Jews

1126
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,367
Nazis

1127
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:35,487
Slave master slave owners record on record labels

1128
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:41,375
Joe Francis that was involved with

1129
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,911
The s*******

1130
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:44,191
Everyone

1131
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:47,775
The doctor that performed the final plastic surgery on my mom

1132
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:50,847
My cousin I was watching my mom I love

1133
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:52,127
Everyone

1134
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:55,967
That is what leaning into God is and that's

1135
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:57,759
The only way

1136
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:58,783
We Chua

1137
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,319
The world

1138
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:01,599
Is by loving

1139
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,391
Now as far as studying up

1140
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,927
The rules are

1141
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:05,695
The country

1142
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,487
This is a Christian country

1143
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:09,023
And the rules of the country

1144
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:10,303
Will be Bass

1145
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:11,839
On the Bible

1146
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:13,887
We're going to

1147
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:18,495
Really we're going to align the Constitution with the Bible

1148
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:19,775
An updated

1149
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:21,567
And we're in the process of doing that right now

1150
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:23,615
Yeah

1151
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:25,151
Well that's the point

1152
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:27,455
Perfect way to end the interview

1153
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:30,015
Jace thanks so much for letting me talk to you again

1154
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,807
I I still don't really

1155
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:33,087
Understand

1156
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:37,439
Today's conversation likes the Infowars you love Jews

1157
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,231
But you're canceled

1158
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:40,767
Anti-semitism

1159
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,815
Because you also love Hitler

1160
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:44,095
But you love everyone equal

1161
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:45,887
Good guys and bad guys

1162
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:49,727
Yeah Jewish people can't tell me who I can love and who I can't love

1163
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:50,495
You can't

1164
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:53,567
You can't force your pain on everyone else

1165
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:56,639
Jewish people forgive Hitler today

1166
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:58,175
Let It Go

1167
00:58:58,943 --> 00:58:59,967
Let It Go

1168
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:01,759
Stop trying to force it on other people

1169
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:04,831
That's not good

1170
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:06,367
I don't care

1171
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:10,463
How famous person is or how much they may

1172
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:16,351
Theoretically do for me potentially if I am ever in an interview giving or receiving an interview

1173
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:20,703
That makes me look as dumb as Gavin McInnes looks right now

1174
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:27,103
Fight tooth and nail to keep it from getting out to the viewing public released

1175
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,383
Kanye would have had to rip

1176
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:34,783
From my cold dead hands before that goes out to the viewing public that is shameful

1177
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:40,671
Create a new Constitution that is Theocratic Ali based

1178
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:47,071
What enjoy that time that first amendment was still have it yet free-speech absolutist pathetic

1179
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:51,167
In the process of creating a new constitution

1180
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:51,935
And like

1181
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:53,983
There isn't any like

1182
00:59:54,495 --> 01:00:00,639
Hey you know that's one of the stupidest ideas I've ever heard

1183
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:07,039
But with no of course not I can take the lord's name in vain

1184
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:13,439
I have been to shows called free speech

1185
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:18,047
Can I take the okay

1186
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:22,655
Are you going to get a rid of the part of the Bible that reminds you of when Jews were available

1187
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:29,055
Is that what's going to go on what did none of this is bible-based constitution based

1188
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:32,895
Do believe weird s*** you're just trying to rewrite it as you make it up on the Fly

1189
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:36,735
Yeah and it's opportunistically using

1190
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,527
Religion as a cover for

1191
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:42,623
A sorts of other stuff makes people crazy

1192
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:43,647
You might

1193
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:45,183
I'll be happy to hear

1194
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:49,535
And that is immediately after the interview Gavin realize that he had whipped

1195
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:51,839
He he realizes he failed tall

1196
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:58,495
So that was 5 hours with yay I guess I tried to talk him off the

1197
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:04,895
As far as Nazi stuff goes

1198
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:10,271
The most popular entertainers in the world and he's going to even know me

1199
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:16,927
Kevin said I should dial it back holyshit what a wake-up call this is

1200
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:17,951
This is who I am

1201
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:22,047
And this is who I actually few more Bloody Marys

1202
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,071
I think that's

1203
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:24,095
Probably as good as

1204
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:27,167
It's going to get for him to self reflection as I can

1205
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:29,471
Six pack while here is him just sort of admitting defeat

1206
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:35,871
Didn't work when Gavin did it it's priced shop

1207
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:40,223
And Christ can do anything

1208
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:46,623
So this was like 40 minutes of an interview and I would really love to get a look at the other hours that were undoubtedly Rick

1209
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:53,023
I have just no tape going there for five hours and produce

1210
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:56,863
We forgot we forgot to press play on the recording

1211
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:00,959
You want to kick you and can we start up again we'll just do a quick 20-30 minutes on it

1212
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:07,615
Appreciate that at the very least Gavin is doing a little soul-searching and realizing the interview was a stupid

1213
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:08,383
Good idea

1214
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:12,991
Maybe not a stupid idea in terms of getting publicity but if his gold really was

1215
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:17,855
The talk ye out of being an anti-semite than Gavin failed the test before you picked up a pen

1216
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:24,511
And part of that is because he's just like every other s******* conman on the right whose beliefs are completely malleable

1217
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:28,351
And could be swayed if they realize the profit margin is better with different beliefs

1218
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:32,447
It seems like Gavin didn't realize or didn't appreciate that Gabe doesn't want to be

1219
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:34,495
We talked off any ledge and he's not on ale

1220
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:39,103
He's acting like yeah he's an old friend who fell in with a bad crowd and yeah sure

1221
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:42,687
Jay is in with a bad crowd but he's not an impressionable team

1222
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:47,295
He's being tricked into being an anti-semite is a willing participant and antagonist

1223
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,831
In this whole operation

1224
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:53,951
Through the course of this interview Gavin is gone through the big transformation from part 1

1225
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:55,999
Over episode into part 2

1226
01:02:56,511 --> 01:03:02,655
At the beginning he thought he could handle gay like he handles all the other opportunistic should heads that he deals with and get him to me

1227
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,679
Moderate his position

1228
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:05,471
So they can get rich together

1229
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:10,079
This is almost like an escalation of attempt to moderate gay

1230
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:13,663
Tim pool is the most ineffectual loser in the right-wing space

1231
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:17,503
So that's a situation where there's not even really going to be meaningful pushback

1232
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:23,647
If he does try to help you smooth out his positions it'll be the softest touch imaginable you might not even notice it

1233
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:24,927
Then

1234
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:26,719
Alex is a little bit more course

1235
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:33,375
He traffics in some of these same antisymmetric ideas himself and he has a lot of experience whitewashing them for the larger.

1236
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:38,239
That's really going to try and help gay into the box where they can make some money together

1237
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:41,567
Is the next level of offensive s*******

1238
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:46,175
Is Alex's version of acceptable anti-Semitism is to water down for you

1239
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:52,575
Perhaps you'd like the Virgin soul to buy the drunk guy who started a street gang that was involved in planning a seditious conspiracy involved

1240
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:53,599
January 6th

1241
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:59,487
Gavin is a little more edgy than Alex so his attempts to soften gaze antisymmetric shiter little edgier

1242
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:01,023
And they're still not even close

1243
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:03,583
To being effective because he doesn't want to be softened

1244
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,375
Or have this message whitewash

1245
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:07,423
What he wants to say

1246
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:12,799
Yeah is not essentially done a speedrun of all the right-wing media from Dopey deji

1247
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:13,567
And rebuff

1248
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:14,591
All of their attempts

1249
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:15,871
To make his position

1250
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:16,639
More palatable

1251
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:20,223
Nothing has been achieved for any side except for Yandex

1252
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,783
They got a ton of attention

1253
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,575
A second goal has not been achieved

1254
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:27,647
Which leads us to be second element of this episode

1255
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:29,951
Which is where Crowder comes in a little more

1256
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,487
The first

1257
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:32,511
Use

1258
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:33,535
Of this

1259
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:34,815
That is so effective

1260
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,351
For the right-wing

1261
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:37,887
Stuff is

1262
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:39,935
Trying to convince him

1263
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:40,703
2

1264
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:41,727
Soft in these ID

1265
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:44,799
That's what Alex date for 3 hours

1266
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:45,567
It's

1267
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:51,967
What Temple probably would have done in some ways if you've been given half a chance

1268
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:54,527
Set out the entire premise

1269
01:04:54,783 --> 01:05:00,927
Saving ye it is a draft pick like legitimately like hey this guy

1270
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:06,303
He's got some Talent he's got a lot of stuff that we can use but he's a little bit rough around the side

1271
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:12,703
If we can develop him into the he could be the Star Quarterback for a team he's just got to get development you know you

1272
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:13,471
Just got to

1273
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:15,775
This on being in our system

1274
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:18,591
Yeah Gloria play totally

1275
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:19,871
So that that's

1276
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:21,663
The one first album

1277
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:23,711
And now the second element comes in

1278
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:26,271
With Crowder and Alice

1279
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:29,855
And just to give a sort of brief

1280
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:32,159
Synopsis of what this is

1281
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,183
8

1282
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:35,743
Be using Kanye as a prop

1283
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:37,023
To be like

1284
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:43,679
My opinions aren't that bad I'm not going to use him is to treat him like a lie

1285
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:46,751
Well how it used to be

1286
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:49,823
And so we're going to see that a bit in this

1287
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:53,151
Interview where Crowder sits down with Alex and talks about

1288
01:05:54,175 --> 01:06:00,319
Breaks his silence or later they were going to be like well we can't use him the way we want to so guess what we're going

1289
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:02,623
Going to say that at least we're not as racist as the Black

1290
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:05,695
They

1291
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:09,023
This episode is just Crowder being funny

1292
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:15,423
Until I even include any of that I can put you through that okay good Alex comes in a ways into the episode

1293
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,983
And they talked for like maybe half an hour 40 minutes

1294
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:21,823
Do something like that and then there's more in the mug Club

1295
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:27,199
I'm not a member

1296
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:29,759
So are we start here with a

1297
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:31,295
Giving a hey buddy

1298
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:32,063
Daleks

1299
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:34,367
Hey looks like you had a tough time there buddy

1300
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,671
Mr. Jones thanks

1301
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:37,695
Thank you for being with us right

1302
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:39,999
We need to include that context

1303
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:41,023
Boy

1304
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:44,095
Seems like you were holding on for a bumpy ride with that

1305
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:46,655
Have you do I do I have it about right to do expect that in your wild

1306
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:47,423
The streams

1307
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:51,519
I know I didn't and I didn't say what he can talk about what I said

1308
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:55,871
Tupac about real issues

1309
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:58,431
Fentanyl and

1310
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,223
America

1311
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:02,271
Really you see the deeper side of

1312
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:04,063
Have you and not just soundbite

1313
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:06,111
And they were like yeah

1314
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:08,671
Stop

1315
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:09,951
Wasn't right away

1316
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,999
Right now

1317
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:12,767
Thursday

1318
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,071
Damn I thought he was joking at first

1319
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,375
Why would you think he was joking at first

1320
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:21,471
No idea I have no idea the things he'd been saying previous to this

1321
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:24,799
I think this is pretty sad

1322
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:25,823
Isaac

1323
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:27,103
That's

1324
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:30,943
I have developed a new form against

1325
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:36,831
The incarcerated State you know Justice is difficult to like figure out and prescript

1326
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:37,599
Justice

1327
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:38,623
Is really difficult

1328
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:41,695
So what I've decided is that Alex needs a

1329
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:42,719
Acquaint Court

1330
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:47,583
Appointed referee right so anywhere he goes like on a conversation like that's that's like

1331
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:53,983
Meyer final study we need that to be enshrined into law

1332
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:58,335
Absolutely you can't say that a red card

1333
01:07:58,591 --> 01:07:59,359
Alright next

1334
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:01,663
You don't like that that needs their needs to be away

1335
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:04,991
That they can't going off and be by themselves and talk like this is

1336
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:11,391
Totally off topic but I remember one time my brother played soccer

1337
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:14,207
Are all the guys on his team got a yellow card

1338
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:15,743
The ref pulled it out he took

1339
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:18,559
From The Ref and ate it

1340
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:22,655
See the Red Bull. Red Card

1341
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:26,495
About 12

1342
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:28,799
I would probably like

1343
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:34,687
Still hilarious

1344
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:36,735
Alex

1345
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:39,551
He has to kind of figure out a way to

1346
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:44,159
Explain what was going on and he's decided that this was a trolling thing

1347
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:50,559
They were trolling even though they're explicitly multiple times during the interview ETA says this isn't rolling

1348
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:56,959
I'm telling you what I think I am telling you what I believe it is just so outside of the pail for these people to

1349
01:08:57,215 --> 01:09:03,359
To actually have to confront someone who believe the things that they lie about or that they lie about not but worth it

1350
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:06,175
What's the mass

1351
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:11,039
Yeah

1352
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,599
I mean really

1353
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:21,023
Super high on real only did it

1354
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:23,071
Feels really good about it

1355
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:27,935
I don't think I was a very good historical knowledge

1356
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:30,239
About WWII either

1357
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:31,007
Oh yeah

1358
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:33,823
In love with a

1359
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:36,127
All of that job design

1360
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:38,431
With so much and what the Nazis is I ended up

1361
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:40,223
Club

1362
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:43,551
Allegations he loves Hitler

1363
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:45,087
Then

1364
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:49,439
Tens of thousands of Nazis had in the world war

1365
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:50,463
The one most

1366
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,487
Major agency show

1367
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:55,839
Alex is still trying to excuse what ye said by making false

1368
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:56,863
Equivalences

1369
01:09:57,375 --> 01:10:02,495
Ye deny the Holocaust but 70 years ago the government brought over Nazi scientist to work on rocket

1370
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:03,519
It's so who's

1371
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:05,823
Really to say what's what he's just

1372
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:06,847
Uninformed

1373
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:12,735
It's a strange thing to argue and the ultimate irony is in front of you

1374
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:15,551
Great that the US brought over Nazis because he loves not

1375
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:22,463
Innocent Alex is trying to control this narrative now that there isn't that pesky personal narrative is about there to stop him

1376
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:26,047
Yes that's what I believe he doesn't believe that is a no idea

1377
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:28,095
Wright's it's

1378
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:29,119
I say things

1379
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:32,703
Because I mean them do you not understand that principle whatsoever

1380
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:34,495
It's really it's really bizarre

1381
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:39,615
It's a desperate attempt to salvage whatever you can out of

1382
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:41,407
You'll make good out of bad

1383
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:46,271
So Alex has some opposition to Nazis and that's great

1384
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:51,903
Although I think that maybe some of the ways that he understands his opposition to Nazis is a little personal

1385
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:55,999
And maybe his problems and complaints about the Nazis are never

1386
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:58,559
Like invading other countries

1387
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:01,631
Systematic genocide of a people

1388
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:08,543
Causing the world war problem or not what he seems have a problem with it. Like

1389
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:11,359
They almost killed my grandpa oh that's

1390
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:12,639
Good

1391
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:14,431
Real things about the

1392
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,711
My family

1393
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,271
OB about

1394
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:23,391
Both my grandfathers almost died

1395
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:25,951
Both of them

1396
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:26,975
I am

1397
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:28,255
Zeolite talked about what

1398
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:29,023
These were like

1399
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:31,327
My mom's

1400
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:32,095
Dad

1401
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:33,119
Also work

1402
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:35,167
Black budget

1403
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:35,935
Programs

1404
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:37,215
60s

1405
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:39,519
Military bases

1406
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:42,335
They were very very Erica

1407
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:43,871
And he didn't like how

1408
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:48,223
Delegate years old here my grandfather

1409
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:49,247
In Austin Texas

1410
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:51,039
Sitting around the kitchen table bench

1411
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:52,575
You do not see

1412
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:54,367
Cheese and working on secret

1413
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:58,975
How much he hated the

1414
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:01,279
That's a real thing that's going on so my

1415
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:04,607
Really comes from my grandfather's who

1416
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:06,399
Both didn't like him very much

1417
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,703
It seems

1418
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:09,727
Not

1419
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:17,407
For someone whose claim to read 100 books about World War II and studied everything

1420
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:20,991
Seems like your reasons for disliking Nazis wouldn't be

1421
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:22,015
They're arrogant

1422
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:24,319
For my grandfather said working with them wasn't

1423
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:26,367
Fun

1424
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:28,927
Bizarre

1425
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:33,023
What's interesting to me about it is that it comes from the same point of view is gay

1426
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:36,095
In my in my vision is because these people

1427
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:38,911
Cannot see outside of their heads

1428
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:41,727
You know they can only see through their own eyes

1429
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:44,031
Big have no ability to like

1430
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:49,407
See the world from outside of that so everything has to relate to something that has happened to him

1431
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:52,735
Pornography is bad not because of the Jews

1432
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:54,783
But because cognac is addicted to pornography

1433
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:58,879
WWII is bad because of

1434
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:01,951
Holocaust because it hurt Alex's

1435
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:06,047
Grandfather you know if I understand make it personal and take it personal

1436
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:07,327
But

1437
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,119
Also the difference

1438
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:13,471
Is are between those two things that you're describing cuz I do think there's an important difference

1439
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:16,799
Hey Matt is that yeah is not taking responsibility

1440
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:23,199
For blaming the Jews for everything where is Alex is

1441
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,479
Sure

1442
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:29,599
Well I mean he's always blaming anybody it can this clip

1443
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:35,231
He's just taking it personally and that's how he understands WWII basically

1444
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:37,791
Maybe

1445
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:38,559
Encanto

1446
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:40,351
Sequential in the grand scheme

1447
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:41,631
Maybe

1448
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:42,655
Small

1449
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:49,055
You know it it sometimes when you say it however you get there at least you got there either. This time

1450
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:54,943
Matter of how Alex thought the interview would go comes up

1451
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:57,759
And I got to call a lot of bulshit on this

1452
01:13:58,527 --> 01:13:59,551
I really thought

1453
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:01,343
I can come in here and shut up

1454
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:04,159
And let him get it out of his system even if he did it

1455
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:07,487
Let's do something different

1456
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:11,839
What's the issues I had all these issues in front of me

1457
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:14,399
You just set those aside we're not getting into that

1458
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:18,495
Figured

1459
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:24,639
But you kind of have the salacious

1460
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:25,407
ROM

1461
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:28,735
Are the Baby Hitler over there

1462
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:32,575
Jimmy Kimmel

1463
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,343
Florida

1464
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:34,879
Jabba the Hutt

1465
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:36,159
There's a salacious

1466
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:37,183
From sitting there but

1467
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:37,951
Seriously

1468
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:40,511
Was really

1469
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:46,143
X whenever he was being dbangz

1470
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:50,239
Fry's

1471
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:55,103
So I want to say that I know definitively that that's not true

1472
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:58,687
Their Alex knew damn well

1473
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:02,527
And his associates were very much into Hitler and

1474
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:03,807
Nazis

1475
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:09,695
Yes that is complete b******* Alex engaged with him well aware of

1476
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:10,719
His beliefs

1477
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:13,023
And the way that these things were being hidden

1478
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:18,143
I don't believe for a second that they went on the road together for the stop the steal stuff

1479
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:20,703
And not nothing

1480
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:24,031
Aveda true nature of Nick's beliefs

1481
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:25,823
Who made clear

1482
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:28,895
Alexander is now in charge

1483
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:32,735
Presumably in charge or at least very involved in gays

1484
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:34,783
Campaign

1485
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:42,975
You could get call you to campaign give to the legitimacy that I refuse to accept but that's fine that's fine

1486
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:46,559
Vanity campaign Champagne price

1487
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:50,655
Alex went like to Georgia and other states

1488
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:53,471
With Alexander and Nick Fuentes

1489
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:56,031
So now he has two people

1490
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:59,359
Who were deeply involved with his own

1491
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:01,151
2020 election

1492
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:03,199
Conspiracies and stuff

1493
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:06,015
And Allie is pretty involved with Infowars

1494
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:07,551
Now they are both

1495
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:11,647
The people who are involved with the I love Hitler guys presidential campaign

1496
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:12,927
Alex is

1497
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:19,583
Far more involved in entwined in this than he wants to believe

1498
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:21,119
Very close to him

1499
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:22,655
And like I said

1500
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,447
I know that he knows

1501
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:27,519
Like these people's beliefs

1502
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,287
It's

1503
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:29,823
You did this to himself

1504
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:32,639
Is every bit of criticism

1505
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:35,711
And Association that people are making

1506
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:42,879
Yeah yeah you know you don't have any Talent of your own and then the closest thing you could get

1507
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:45,439
Two Talent was an eighteen-year-old Nazi

1508
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:50,047
So Rick is very talented

1509
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:51,071
Especially

1510
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:56,191
Compare Talent finale

1511
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:57,983
Youngest nothing that we do

1512
01:16:59,263 --> 01:16:59,775
Released

1513
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:05,151
What a what that's the biggest compliment I have to get what is superlative

1514
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:06,687
So Alex does not like

1515
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:13,599
Hitler was a disaster

1516
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:19,487
Hitler

1517
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:21,023
The points are communist agenda

1518
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:22,559
It is basically just as bad

1519
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:28,959
So powerful

1520
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:32,287
What should say where was Hitler

1521
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:37,407
I'm not mad

1522
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:38,431
Either person

1523
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:41,503
Sounds like you know

1524
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:44,575
Whole bunch of programs like the young turds and all of them say

1525
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,135
Secret house

1526
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:50,463
Authoritarians I hate

1527
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,231
Communist

1528
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:53,279
I hate Hitler

1529
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:55,839
Hey Joseph

1530
01:17:57,887 --> 01:18:00,191
Fidel Castro I hate Hugo Chavez

1531
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:01,471
I love George Washington

1532
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:03,007
I love Thomas Jefferson

1533
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:07,871
Society

1534
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:11,711
Free speech and I want it back now

1535
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:18,111
Octagon

1536
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:31,423
It almost feels like Alex dissociated for a moment

1537
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,959
Completely off topic point

1538
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:36,031
I think he was researching his mind for his stock things

1539
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:38,847
Things to shout that involve Hitler and that's one of his big one

1540
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:44,735
Yeah it kind of gives the impression that he's not really mentally processing this conversation might be a little bit on autopilot

1541
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:47,295
And also wanting to relive those those

1542
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:53,951
1776 2.0 how much press he got because of yelling

1543
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:58,047
I'm at stop CNN with Piers Morgan Glory Days

1544
01:18:58,303 --> 01:19:04,447
Right you went to that to gunshow where Piers Morgan is doing a remote and he begs him to come back on the show

1545
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:08,543
Such a good hit of adrenaline from

1546
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:10,079
It was so good

1547
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:13,151
Any wants to relive that a little bit now I think in

1548
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:15,199
Make a different kind of attention now

1549
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:18,527
Tired of your s***

1550
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:21,087
Tired of

1551
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:22,879
Things being very obvious

1552
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:23,647
You know like

1553
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:26,719
Two of the most hateful people on the planet I've just listen

1554
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:29,023
Listen to list things they love

1555
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:33,887
For a while I don't have to regularly list things that I love or hate

1556
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:40,287
In order to prove something you don't have to list off a bunch of things that you love to provide cover for the fact that you love them

1557
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:46,687
Also I don't have to list off a bunch of things that I hate and then say I love them to make people think that I'm not

1558
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:48,735
I hated myself

1559
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:50,015
So

1560
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:51,039
So there was this

1561
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:53,599
Dynamic it was going on with the yay

1562
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:54,367
Show

1563
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,647
And that was

1564
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:57,695
Is this I love everybody

1565
01:19:58,207 --> 01:20:00,255
And that was how it's pretty clear

1566
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:01,535
That that was

1567
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:02,303
A little bit of a

1568
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:03,071
The b*******

1569
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:07,167
Well listed things that he said he loved

1570
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:10,239
He was only listing them because those are the things that he hates

1571
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:12,031
And people know that

1572
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:13,567
So he has to say that he loves them

1573
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:16,896
Except for things like Nazis and Hitler

1574
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:18,176
He loves Nazis

1575
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:22,528
Sure the love stuff I mean there was just the like Holocaust

1576
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:24,576
Didn't happen stuff

1577
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:25,600
Yeah

1578
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:26,624
I got to say

1579
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:29,184
Steven Crowder doesn't buy this s***

1580
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:30,464
Like he does

1581
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:36,352
He doesn't like going for the I love everybody at right right

1582
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:38,400
You have Steven Crowder

1583
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:39,424
Being like

1584
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:44,288
This is some b******* your nonsense is

1585
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,336
Your people trying to defend its thing

1586
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:48,640
Well there's validity to that

1587
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:50,688
Kanye West that I love everybody

1588
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:53,504
He didn't say you hated me but he said I loved you that was Hitler but

1589
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:55,040
He did go out of his way

1590
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:56,064
To praise

1591
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:58,368
Actions of Hitler while condemning a

1592
01:20:58,624 --> 01:20:59,136
Actions of

1593
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:00,928
Jews in this sort of General monolith

1594
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:01,696
And he did

1595
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:03,488
Deny the holler

1596
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:06,560
I love everybody

1597
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:09,888
That's not what happened with that interview enough people out there want to say hey

1598
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,680
He has every right to love Hitler

1599
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:15,264
Of course if you say I agree with him when he says he loves Hitler in the

1600
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,544
Holocaust didn't happen fine

1601
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:18,336
Equivalency

1602
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:20,128
You know I'm on your show and it's

1603
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:22,688
Shorty said he loved everyone

1604
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:23,712
But he did have

1605
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:24,992
Specific praise

1606
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:26,272
For some to tell

1607
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:27,040
Military indict

1608
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:33,952
Not good not good when Steven Crowder sees through your f****** game and is calling it out

1609
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:36,256
Who in trying to the right to love Hitler

1610
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:39,840
I think we can revoke that right I don't think you should have the right to love Hitler

1611
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:41,632
You can't love Hitler

1612
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:43,424
Okay demanded

1613
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,448
Bill of Rights

1614
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:47,520
How do we how do we

1615
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:49,056
How does this work function

1616
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:53,408
How do you legislate this

1617
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:55,712
It's against the law

1618
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:57,760
What if you are Hitler's parents

1619
01:21:58,528 --> 01:21:59,808
They killed him

1620
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:01,344
But what

1621
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:05,952
But but are now they just put yourself in that situation

1622
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:08,256
Absolutely cuz he's the genocider

1623
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:14,912
I think you're I think you're going to have a tough time writing this into law telling you I feel like a very specific la like if some

1624
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:18,752
Somebody has committed genocide they don't get love anymore

1625
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:22,848
You sounded like Alex's mom

1626
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:25,408
Off money you don't get love no more

1627
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,992
I I think that this is a

1628
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:30,016
This is

1629
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:33,856
Kind of legislation that you're going to spend a lot of time trying to crack

1630
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:38,464
Veneers wasting taxpayers dollars

1631
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:42,048
Also probably against free speech

1632
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:43,328
Beach money is

1633
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,376
That citizens united baby

1634
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:47,936
So Steven Crowder

1635
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:48,704
Bike

1636
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:52,544
Kind of pushing back on this in a way that is kind of surprising

1637
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,848
Inasmuch as he actually is

1638
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:56,896
Do you think the media got this one right

1639
01:22:57,152 --> 01:23:00,736
Like what yeah actually is mad

1640
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:02,016
How do you think the Press

1641
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:02,784
As is

1642
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:03,808
Covid-19

1643
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,088
You I think the

1644
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:08,160
Yeah, course I will try and turn feather you I'm saying do you think that

1645
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:09,696
The way the Press

1646
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:10,464
She said it hey

1647
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:11,488
Kanye West

1648
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:12,256
Yay

1649
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:13,024
On Alex Jones

1650
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:14,816
Went off and was

1651
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:16,352
Very obviously incredibly aunt

1652
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:18,400
Do we think that Anna

1653
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:19,168
This case

1654
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,960
Was depressed parsley right

1655
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:24,032
Another word that they completely misrepresenting it or when you were sitting there

1656
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,080
Did you feel as though I'm

1657
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:28,128
This is probably not too productive

1658
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:30,944
Look

1659
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,224
I like

1660
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:34,784
Kanye West I like yeah

1661
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:36,832
I think he really means well

1662
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:42,720
I don't know if Nick Fuentes believe what he says doing Nick says a lot of really good stuff I agree with

1663
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:45,024
Once I heard him indoors

1664
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:46,560
That he thinks Hitler

1665
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:48,608
Great I I lost a lot of respect for him

1666
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:51,936
5 years ago

1667
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:54,496
Smart but you know he's kind of a savant

1668
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:04,224
Wants to be a big revolutionary wants to hit the barbed wire is he said

1669
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:06,784
He said your Terminator 11 Terminator 10

1670
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:09,600
And I just really think it's the end of the day is that that's not

1671
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:10,624
How to change the left

1672
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:12,416
I'm adopted so many of the actual

1673
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:14,976
I'm control

1674
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:16,512
Their whole

1675
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:18,304
System of lockdown

1676
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:21,120
Big groups of people

1677
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:22,144
March together

1678
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,192
Glad buy one pie Piper

1679
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:26,496
White medical uniform

1680
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:30,080
Audiology

1681
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,640
Striving for

1682
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:33,664
That Hitler

1683
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:37,504
What about all this

1684
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:41,856
Kill h.g. Wells

1685
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:44,160
Gilbert's rustling others

1686
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:46,976
Because they emerge Russell haddock

1687
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:47,744
Competing

1688
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:49,792
Authoritarian World Government left

1689
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:50,816
Bottle

1690
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:57,216
So just real quick Alex's referring to Hitler's black book which was a list of people he wanted rounded up and killed after the Nazis

1691
01:24:57,472 --> 01:24:58,752
Planned invasion of the UK

1692
01:24:59,008 --> 01:25:00,288
In operation sea lion

1693
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:06,176
Alex is made up of they want to kill HG Wells and Bertrand Russell because they were setting up a rivaling world

1694
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:10,528
That is for all intents and purposes Alex whitewashing not CS

1695
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:16,160
Hitler wanted to kill Wells because he ran an organization called poets sas2 novelist

1696
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:17,440
International witches

1697
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:22,304
Spell the German branch of the group because they only accepted Area writers into their membership

1698
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:28,960
He was a very vocal critic of the German government and was a very understandable Target especially considering the offense

1699
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:32,032
Seed made against Germany's place in the art and culture world

1700
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,336
The reasoning was similar for Russell

1701
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:39,968
Be a better non-interventionist and eat switch positions and decided that Hitler was a threat to all of Europe and needed to be

1702
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:40,736
He fought

1703
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:45,600
The list includes a bunch of folks like Virginia Woolf who they wanted to kill because she was married to a Jewish man

1704
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:50,208
And all the trucks Lee because he helped Jewish artists and writers flee from Germany

1705
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:53,792
Elsa sings complete b******* and it's carrying water for him

1706
01:25:54,560 --> 01:26:00,192
Now larger picture what Crowder is doing here is the second stage of the purpose gay serves to the right-wing

1707
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:00,960
As we discussed

1708
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:03,008
I'm sort of two parts of the episode

1709
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:06,080
Kroger seems to have realized with so many have missed

1710
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:09,408
Which is that yay means this s*** he's not going to relay

1711
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:11,456
And maybe people are right Scala maybe somebody

1712
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:18,368
He's getting ahead of the ball for a very important purpose which is essentially to create an avatar of an anti-semite

1713
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:20,928
You can use them to excuse his own toxic opinion

1714
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:27,840
Anytime he's accused of saying something f***** up or anti-semitic you can say I'm not yay and that has the effect of giving him some breathe

1715
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:28,608
Sunroom

1716
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:30,656
Alex knows this Dynamic well

1717
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:36,032
Since you was on the other side of it for most of his career and still is use that way from time to time

1718
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,568
Most of Glenn Beck's

1719
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:40,384
Conspiracy bulshit early career was predicated on him

1720
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:43,712
I'm not Alex Jones a pretending

1721
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:45,248
That proves rationality

1722
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:50,880
Even within the last year when he was being grilled about his promotion of great replacement conspiracies

1723
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:54,720
Tucker Carlson shopvac this isn't some Alex Jones s***

1724
01:26:55,488 --> 01:27:00,864
You can fill a very important role for these right-wing media figures which is to be the person they are not

1725
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,656
Which excuses their rhetoric

1726
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:08,800
That person goes too far and I'm not that person therefore I've not gone too far and what I'm saying is acceptable

1727
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:15,712
I want to have someone like you gay it provides a rare opportunity where there's this huge celebrities that the media is eyes will be on what

1728
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:20,064
Precinct and he's bombastic personality so he's not going to take this halfway

1729
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:26,976
This combination leads to the conversation going so far past the point of acceptability that it allows people like crab

1730
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:29,536
To move the ball a little bit down the field

1731
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:31,840
Look like he's done anything

1732
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:35,168
For instance in response to denying the Holocaust

1733
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:41,568
Crowder can condemn that but then decry the problem of quote secular humanist with Jewish last names in Hollywood

1734
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,872
That's pretty f***** up stuff

1735
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:47,456
Compared to what yeah is putting out there certainly doesn't seem that bad

1736
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:48,736
Have yagos

1737
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:49,760
50

1738
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:55,136
I can go 30 I mean that's why that's why when McKenna says you know like

1739
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:58,208
Hey it's not all the Jews it's most of the Jews

1740
01:27:58,464 --> 01:27:59,232
But not all of

1741
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:01,536
You know it's like no that's

1742
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:02,304
That's

1743
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,840
Equally anti-Semitic

1744
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:05,376
Those are on equal footing

1745
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:09,216
And yet because ye is willing to save the full thing

1746
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:09,984
Andy

1747
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:11,264
McGinnis

1748
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:17,408
Does the luxury of being able to be like haha I'm only 90% racist

1749
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:20,480
Then he gets away with it more than otherwise yet

1750
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:27,392
Temple and honestly wants the rest of the right-wing should heads come to the realization that they're not going to be able to

1751
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:28,928
Monetize gay himself

1752
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:32,256
This will be the next best thing for them to be able to do

1753
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:33,024
Yeah

1754
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:33,792
And

1755
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:37,632
It's going to be unfortunate because they have let him

1756
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:38,400
In

1757
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:39,168
A little bit

1758
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:41,472
And that means they can get burned

1759
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:43,520
By him once they

1760
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:44,288
Start

1761
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:50,688
Shooting on every could be a problem for all of us that they don't seem to realize that Nick is

1762
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:51,968
Coming for them

1763
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:57,344
Like well we'll see you there in a little bit that's what I think is very funny about all of this is that

1764
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:01,440
They are looking at Nick and yay going on all of these interviews thinking

1765
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:03,488
They're trying to do some whites

1766
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:04,512
Supremacist s***

1767
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:06,304
Not realizing that Nick

1768
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:07,840
Is going for them

1769
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:09,120
He is choosing

1770
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:10,656
Those people to attack

1771
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:11,680
In order to take

1772
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:12,448
Their ship

1773
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:18,848
Yeah it's basically like how he had this whole campaign against Turning Point USA

1774
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:20,128
It what he wasn't going

1775
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:21,152
Get some

1776
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:23,712
Group it was going against someone on the right

1777
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:27,552
Because the people who are in that audience are far more likely to

1778
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:28,832
Come over to his side

1779
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:31,392
Then if you were to go to some antifa meeting

1780
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:32,672
And cause a scene

1781
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:36,000
He can he can say things that these folks

1782
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:36,768
Aren't they

1783
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:38,304
Am pretend

1784
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,096
That there's some kind of a secret

1785
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:42,912
Conspiratorial reason why they're not saying these

1786
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:48,800
These whacked-out things that these people

1787
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:52,640
Did the same Dynamic is essentially at play with

1788
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:59,040
These are stops on his campaign to her all think that he is like everybody else

1789
01:29:59,296 --> 01:30:00,832
She's just another one of the parasites

1790
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:03,392
But this dude is a disease man

1791
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:08,000
He is not going to to suck you dry he's going to steal your s*** and kill you

1792
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:08,768
Yeah

1793
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:15,168
It's good timing for someone like Alex to have to deal with something like this considering that he just

1794
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:21,568
Declare personal bankruptcy is companies in bankruptcy keogh's a billion dollars at the height of his power

1795
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:24,896
I knew this is actually kind of old news

1796
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:25,920
But

1797
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:26,944
The

1798
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:27,712
The

1799
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:28,480
Stuff

1800
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:34,368
That he owes because of these judgments is not dischargeable in bankruptcy

1801
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:38,976
That was something we already had an awareness of but they had just

1802
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:41,792
Litigate

1803
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:45,120
He's in a perfect position to have somebody who he is

1804
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:47,168
Enabled app platform.

1805
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:48,192
Legitimised

1806
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:53,568
Come in and say horrible things about him and try and leech off the audience

1807
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:55,360
You know it's so weird

1808
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:56,896
That Sith Lords

1809
01:30:57,152 --> 01:30:57,664
Aren't

1810
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:58,688
Like best buds

1811
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,992
You know like they are the one always tries to

1812
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:02,784
To kill the other one it's like why

1813
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:03,808
You know

1814
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:05,088
Just be best buds

1815
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:08,416
There can only be one Highlander

1816
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:09,696
Bulshit

1817
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:13,792
Rambles a lot about Orwell

1818
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:18,400
A1984

1819
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:20,192
Do I happen to know for a fact

1820
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:24,032
And the tactic that's what George Orwell wrote

1821
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,896
A British intelligence in WWII

1822
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:30,688
Communist before that and

1823
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:33,504
Spanish

1824
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:36,064
Top of the British

1825
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:38,880
Socialist society

1826
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:44,768
That actually Stalin was being funded by the West

1827
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:47,328
Individual in the future

1828
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:49,120
Hitler

1829
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:50,144
By British intelligence

1830
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:51,936
Not not run by there but

1831
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:53,728
You're built up again

1832
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:54,752
Power and funding

1833
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:56,032
Early by the Big Bang

1834
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:57,312
He realize

1835
01:31:57,824 --> 01:31:58,336
That

1836
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:00,896
Global authoritarian system topper

1837
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:06,784
Total power and control

1838
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:09,088
Well that's clear

1839
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:11,136
Very clear

1840
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:13,952
George Orwell

1841
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:15,488
Before he died in 19

1842
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:16,256
49

1843
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:17,792
Finished

1844
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:19,584
47

1845
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:22,144
But he

1846
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:24,704
As well

1847
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:33,408
And then he later learned it was a more evil group

1848
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:34,688
Fabian socialist

1849
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:36,224
British intelligence

1850
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:37,248
Respect

1851
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,296
I'll let you see the James Bond movies

1852
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:40,064
I'm sorry

1853
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:41,600
James Bond

1854
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:44,672
British

1855
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:46,976
Empire model that Virgin America

1856
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:51,072
That point

1857
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:52,096
Systems.

1858
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:52,864
Domino's

1859
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:55,936
I didn't play them off against

1860
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:57,728
Each other

1861
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:04,384
So was it a good idea if they are not I would like to just ask him to provide

1862
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:07,200
Resume sources on the

1863
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:08,480
Any of that

1864
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:09,504
Yeah that was

1865
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:10,272
That was fun

1866
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:11,296
I'm guessing

1867
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:17,696
He's referring to like omage to Catalonia I feel like I just got a lot of exposition from a steam

1868
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:24,096
Punk novel psychic telling me about the the previous history before the apocalypse happened that's what I feel like

1869
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:24,864
I just heard a

1870
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:27,168
A lot of alternate reality

1871
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:28,192
I believe you are like

1872
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:34,592
Coral worked at the BBC I don't know if he was number two and British intelligence and propaganda

1873
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:35,616
I don't know

1874
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:41,760
Committed Democratic Socialist into the last years of his life

1875
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:47,392
I just answer the phone story but I need Alex to substantiate any of this

1876
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:48,160
Comforting

1877
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:49,184
About this

1878
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:49,952
Is

1879
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:52,000
For certain people

1880
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:54,048
Once they start talking about a subject

1881
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:56,864
I no longer feel the need to know

1882
01:33:57,376 --> 01:34:00,960
Alex are talking about or well I don't need to

1883
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:02,496
I don't need to be like oh

1884
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:08,896
Why is he saying this thing about this book that doesn't say the thing that he saying

1885
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:13,504
I don't know

1886
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:16,832
So Alex is a new explanation for why you did what he did

1887
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:20,672
Infowars.com

1888
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:24,000
Go to infowars.com

1889
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:28,352
And find a full interview

1890
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:29,632
Actually see it

1891
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:32,192
Contacts

1892
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:33,984
Watched again

1893
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:36,800
Watch lot of extra

1894
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:37,568
Tarzan

1895
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:39,616
I just think what happened was

1896
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:41,920
He decided to go all the way inside

1897
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:44,224
Responsible

1898
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:45,760
Screw the world

1899
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:49,088
And then once he started pressing on the dopamine button

1900
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:51,648
The banks he said

1901
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:52,416
He just couldn't

1902
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:53,184
Stop

1903
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:56,512
You know Justin

1904
01:34:56,768 --> 01:34:58,816
Situation

1905
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:00,352
The entire time he was on

1906
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:01,632
Yeah

1907
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:03,168
Yeah it seems like that

1908
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:03,936
That might be the

1909
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:04,960
Doesn't

1910
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:07,520
Doesn't seem like that might be the case at all

1911
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:11,360
It's not adrenalinn he was not a addicted to Adrenaline

1912
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:16,992
It's not like a crime of passion he brought a net and Yahoo

1913
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:18,016
Yahoo

1914
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:20,576
That was premeditated

1915
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:24,160
That was a murder one if you will accommodate

1916
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:29,024
I bless those props just happened to be at Alex's desk which leaves

1917
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:35,424
Incredibly unlikely it would be a strange improv thing to ya

1918
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:37,984
We've had this net and we've had this YooHoo out here

1919
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:43,872
For twenty years thinking somebody's going to put it together sooner or later right and here it is

1920
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:50,272
Is finally paid off

1921
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:51,808
I just I mean

1922
01:35:52,576 --> 01:35:58,720
It is any kind of excuse people tried to make Relic Michael Richards

1923
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:00,256
For that because they're there

1924
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:01,024
Is there

1925
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:04,608
Lives are built around claiming the racism can't even happen

1926
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:07,680
Because it doesn't exist

1927
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:12,288
Exactly but then they're here and they're just like man

1928
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:13,568
I don't know if I can

1929
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:16,384
Can say that racism doesn't exist after that

1930
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:23,040
What we got to come up with a bunch of new ways so many different ways to just be like listen it's okay to be erase

1931
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:23,808
Racist

1932
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:25,344
But maybe not this races

1933
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:30,976
So Crowder he takes

1934
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:33,536
That cover that ye is provided

1935
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:35,584
Gets into a little bit of his own

1936
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,120
Anti-semitism

1937
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:39,168
There's a very big difference between yes

1938
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:39,936
I do think there's a

1939
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:40,960
Conversation to be had

1940
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:42,240
Secularists

1941
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:45,824
In the entertainment industry and if someone wants to conflate

1942
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:47,360
What's anti-semitism

1943
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:50,688
What they're doing saying always at because you're saying because they're Jewish Journal

1944
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:52,736
I'm saying for the same reason that they're plenty of

1945
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:54,272
Non-jewish people in the in

1946
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:55,040
Entertainment industry

1947
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:56,576
Who are involved with grooming

1948
01:36:56,832 --> 01:36:58,112
Score involved with by the way

1949
01:36:58,368 --> 01:37:00,160
The degeneracy of society

1950
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:01,952
The only reason people

1951
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:04,000
Largely atheist use any

1952
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:05,280
Ministry or for example

1953
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:06,048
Thanks

1954
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:09,632
Which compared to their damn as a percent of the population is true for the same reason

1955
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:11,168
There plenty of Jewish doctors

1956
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:14,496
That dynamic as describing earlier on full display

1957
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:17,312
If these people's jewishness isn't important

1958
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:22,176
Why is it important that a conversation about the secular humanist with Jewish names who are in Hollywood

1959
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:28,576
You didn't say it exactly that way in this clip but that is what he's been going on about in the aftermath of the end of you

1960
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:34,208
If the problem is the indecency of Hollywood shouldn't their jewishness not even be a point worth bringing up

1961
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:39,584
Stevens concerned that these people having Jewish names because he's making exactly the point he's pretending.

1962
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:45,984
This is pretty antisymmetric position that Steven is expressing but because he is out there denying the Holocaust

1963
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:52,384
It gives him the ability to express things like this and say I'm not yet by Abby's better conspiracy insinuations or

1964
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:53,152
Irrational

1965
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:54,944
Look at me I'm not that far out

1966
01:37:55,712 --> 01:38:01,856
These are the kinds of side consequences that come with platforming someone like ye and I find it difficult to believe that these right-wing

1967
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:03,392
Ding-dongs don't understand that

1968
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:05,184
What they want

1969
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:11,584
To be able to be bigots while taking an imaginary High ground with anyone calls them out for it so they don't have to

1970
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,120
Feel bad about themselves

1971
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:14,400
They're in the wake

1972
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:17,216
Yay and his b*******

1973
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:17,984
Just going

1974
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:19,264
Listen that's

1975
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:25,664
Crazy that wave is too big now I do think there's something to be said about talking about the way

1976
01:38:26,432 --> 01:38:27,456
That's the problem

1977
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:30,272
Nick and yeah

1978
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:32,576
They are

1979
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:33,600
What if they are

1980
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:34,880
No they aren't they said they

1981
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:41,280
Otherwise they aren't

1982
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:47,936
Adrenaline and I don't even understand you any more push-ups

1983
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:51,776
Look if they are it's the last fall

1984
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:53,568
The lapses raps

1985
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:56,896
Captain America we're fighting a Nazi

1986
01:39:04,832 --> 01:39:05,600
Do people like Kanye West

1987
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:07,904
But I'll tell you

1988
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:10,976
I've been attacked massively by the ATL all these other groups

1989
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:12,256
And they rap

1990
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:16,096
Me and the name of Jews

1991
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:16,864
Which is

1992
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:20,448
Then making a lot of people think is good you must be bad

1993
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:24,032
I've saved this pretty pathetic attempt to avoid doing any soul-searching

1994
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:27,104
Bluffton do s*** to make these idiots into Nazis

1995
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:27,872
But

1996
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:29,664
Alex sure as s*** has

1997
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:36,320
His entire worldview in imaginary enemies are characterized by complete plagiarism from the protocols of the Elders of Zion

1998
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:39,904
Mixed up with anti-semitic Trope from history like blood libel and

1999
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:40,672
Well poised

2000
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:45,536
He constantly makes excuses for Raven bigots and anti-semites and gives his audience

2001
01:39:45,792 --> 01:39:48,864
Flimsy Arguments for why you shouldn't see them as Raven bigots

2002
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:51,424
An anti-semite said which they actually are

2003
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:52,704
Anyone

2004
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:58,336
Much

2005
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:04,736
Alex is consistently hosted outright 80 semites and Holocaust deniers on his show and he never is that a problem

2006
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:07,552
Funneling is audience into their information spaces

2007
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:10,112
So long as they keep their s*** subtle on air

2008
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:13,952
The list of people from recent times is pretty long but it goes

2009
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:15,744
As far back as he's been on air

2010
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:22,144
In recent 2003 episode that we did we saw him interviewing Eric Schmidt the holocaust-denying Techno DJ

2011
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:24,192
And that wasn't an isolated incident

2012
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:29,568
Flash forward to the present days having softball pretend debates with David Duke and Richard Spencer

2013
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:33,152
And hosting friendly conversations with the man who has inspired

2014
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:36,480
A lot of Nick and gave current ideology e Michael Jones

2015
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:43,392
Is anyone facilitated the slide further down the path toward anti-Semitism it's been Alex with all of his nonexistence

2016
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:45,696
Standards for Guess election and show prep

2017
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:47,232
Even so frame

2018
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:49,792
I mean this whole thing as a reaction is unacceptable

2019
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:54,912
Yang and Nick are anti-semites they've decided to be so because they believed bulshit

2020
01:40:55,424 --> 01:41:01,568
I was just trying to take moral responsibility away from their decision by saying that it's the left evil manipulative actions

2021
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:04,128
That led them to be a-coming nafees out of spite

2022
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,664
I guess I guess it's fine

2023
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:07,712
The implication here is that the left

2024
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:12,064
If the left weren't doing the things they were doing naked ye would be at the semites which

2025
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:12,832
Isn't true

2026
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:17,696
Nick's been this way for a long time and now it's was fully aware that the whole time he's known him

2027
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:23,584
He's just not able to plausibly deny who Nick is anymore so he needs to come up with a new Spin and it's pretty f******

2028
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:27,424
Yeah listening to this it just reminds me of

2029
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:29,472
How unfortunate is that we're all here

2030
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:31,264
It all like I feel like

2031
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:33,056
If we could

2032
01:41:33,312 --> 01:41:34,080
Just get

2033
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:37,408
You know all of the not them people

2034
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:39,712
And go on a holiday for like

2035
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:40,480
Three or four wheel

2036
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:42,528
When we come back later killed each other

2037
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:49,184
Like even this s*** they can't help but say oh it's the left but did it it's a if we weren't here they still blame the left and

2038
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:55,584
Can I just call each other the laughter they already already LOL

2039
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,120
Here for them to kill us

2040
01:41:57,376 --> 01:42:00,192
What even this small group that is like around

2041
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:05,824
Yeah is already incredibly volatile Milo was in and in-charge and now he's out

2042
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:10,432
Maybe Ali Alexander is taking his place so who knows

2043
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:13,760
But yeah there is there will be

2044
01:42:14,272 --> 01:42:15,040
Chaotic

2045
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:16,832
Comings and goings

2046
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:17,600
But I think

2047
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:19,648
Nick is probably in

2048
01:42:19,904 --> 01:42:22,208
Yeah well he owned

2049
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:25,536
You know it's

2050
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:26,304
It's

2051
01:42:27,584 --> 01:42:29,120
Their ideas are so dumb

2052
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:30,144
And so

2053
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,680
Stupid that when they

2054
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:37,568
Say them out loud and are challenged by another person of their ilk with dumb and stupid ideas that are

2055
01:42:38,336 --> 01:42:39,872
They blame other people

2056
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:44,224
Rather than even engage with their own ideas being dumb and stupid they're just both like

2057
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:46,784
Yeah isn't it other people's fault we're stupid

2058
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:49,600
So many other people

2059
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:50,624
ZR1 last

2060
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:52,928
Clipper Crowder here

2061
01:42:53,696 --> 01:42:54,208
I'm just

2062
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:55,488
The left

2063
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,304
Weaponizing WWII

2064
01:42:58,816 --> 01:42:59,328
Years ago

2065
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:01,376
77 years ago

2066
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:03,680
Is very very dangerous on the left sing

2067
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:09,824
Courses on that

2068
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:11,360
Is going to them make knots

2069
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:15,968
Because she was a bunch of leftist academics of Hollywood people

2070
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:19,552
Literally trying to teach the majority-minority

2071
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:20,832
Majority

2072
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:23,392
White people who aren't

2073
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:25,184
A certain religious group

2074
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:27,744
All that people

2075
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:32,352
And here you can see Alex doing some acceptable antisemitism well getting

2076
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:33,632
To use Yeahs cover

2077
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:38,496
This is absurd but let's play around with this idea a little bit so you can see what Alex is actually saying

2078
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:45,664
Less leftist academics and Hollywood people many of them Jewish are teaching non-white people that

2079
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:47,968
People except Jews are inherently evil

2080
01:43:49,248 --> 01:43:51,040
Kind of thing will make Nazis look legitimate

2081
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:54,368
To the left is driving people toward becoming Nazis

2082
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:59,744
That's fascinating because I pretty much agree with Alex's construction except for one par

2083
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:03,840
Academics in the media and Hollywood aren't saying white people are inherited

2084
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:04,864
The evil

2085
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:09,984
That's a paranoid white identity fantasy that Alex uses for a bunch of different narrative shortcut

2086
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:12,800
But it's one that's just accepted as truth on his show

2087
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:18,944
He does make some sense that believing Alex's version of the world would make Nazis not look that bad

2088
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:21,760
So in essence if you believe the pipeline

2089
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:22,528
Describing

2090
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:25,088
That he's actually responsible for the creation of a

2091
01:44:26,624 --> 01:44:32,512
He presents people with a false reality that makes the Nazis look less extreme than they actually are

2092
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:36,864
Thereby making him a more acceptable group to associate with or Ally with

2093
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:43,008
How bad are the Nazis compared to the global has to work for the literal devil and want to kill all humans

2094
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:44,800
Well

2095
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:45,568
I mean

2096
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:48,128
The thing about that though is whenever you

2097
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:50,688
Turn things into that kind of duality

2098
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:51,712
Bright

2099
01:44:52,224 --> 01:44:52,736
Okay

2100
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:53,760
So

2101
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:55,296
As ye said you know if

2102
01:44:55,552 --> 01:44:56,064
If you're not working

2103
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:56,832
For Christ

2104
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:57,600
Then you're working for

2105
01:44:57,856 --> 01:44:58,368
The devil

2106
01:44:59,136 --> 01:44:59,648
And he

2107
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:01,440
You thinks that Hitler and the Nazi

2108
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:02,208
These were good

2109
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:03,744
So they were working

2110
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:04,512
For Christ

2111
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:06,816
That's what his

2112
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:07,584
Position is

2113
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:09,632
Is that God wants you to kill juice

2114
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:15,264
There are some implications that maybe would be best not explored if you're them

2115
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:19,360
So these two documents I believe

2116
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:20,384
Illustrate

2117
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:21,664
Something of my point

2118
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:23,968
The

2119
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:27,296
Did the ways that gave being used

2120
01:45:27,552 --> 01:45:28,064
5

2121
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:30,112
These folks

2122
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:30,880
Nothing

2123
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:33,696
Where is the immediate

2124
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:36,256
Desperate Desire by these folks

2125
01:45:36,512 --> 01:45:37,536
Try and

2126
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:41,888
Softer softer

2127
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:43,168
Bring into the fold

2128
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:46,752
This incredibly famous celebrity that they can

2129
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:49,056
I try and Ride Along

2130
01:45:49,568 --> 01:45:50,592
And it does not work

2131
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:53,664
Because he's not on the same scam

2132
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:55,456
Grip level that they are

2133
01:45:55,968 --> 01:46:01,344
And then the alter ultimate their conclusion is using him as a prop

2134
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:02,624
To justify your own

2135
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:03,392
Dollar Tree

2136
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:09,792
Essentially it's it's kind of Overton window e in terms of how it works or they be on the way

2137
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:10,560
Look at it

2138
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:13,120
Diego's this far so you can

2139
01:46:13,376 --> 01:46:15,936
Can go that far right quarters of the

2140
01:46:16,448 --> 01:46:18,752
The way down field he's he's

2141
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:22,848
The battering ram IC is even described himself at stand

2142
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:24,384
It's bad

2143
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:31,040
It's bad and people should know better I think they do know better and they're actively participating in this to me

2144
01:46:31,296 --> 01:46:32,320
Steven Crowder

2145
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:37,696
His appearance here is essentially only in the second

2146
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:38,464
Enphase

2147
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:39,744
And I suspect

2148
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:42,048
That's because gay wouldn't go on his show

2149
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:45,120
Yeah I think maybe there's a chance that like that book

2150
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:45,888
Didn't happen

2151
01:46:46,144 --> 01:46:49,472
And so Crowder didn't have to go through the first stage of this

2152
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:50,752
Yeah

2153
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:53,312
Oh absolutely

2154
01:46:54,336 --> 01:46:57,664
So that's kind of the informative section of this but

2155
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:59,712
I thought in the interest of fairness

2156
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:01,760
Sure maybe not

2157
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:08,928
I wanted to play some clips and discuss a Twitter spaces

2158
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:09,952
Nick Fuentes dead

2159
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:10,976
In response

2160
01:47:11,232 --> 01:47:14,048
To Alex's interview on crowder show

2161
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:16,864
All right he does not take kindly

2162
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:20,704
To some of the things that Alex has said and

2163
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:23,264
In my response he ends up

2164
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:27,616
Things that Alex probably isn't going to appreciate being made public

2165
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:33,504
So we start here and Nick realizes that Richard Spencer's in the chat

2166
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:35,040
Hey Richard

2167
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:41,952
Let's go

2168
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:43,488
Alright so

2169
01:47:46,304 --> 01:47:47,584
I was going to a space yesterday

2170
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:49,888
I'm going to dive into it

2171
01:47:50,144 --> 01:47:50,912
Today

2172
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:51,936
Respond to

2173
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:53,472
Alex Jones

2174
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:54,752
And that whole

2175
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:56,800
Tencel as you know

2176
01:47:57,312 --> 01:47:58,848
Me and Jay went on Alice

2177
01:47:59,104 --> 01:48:01,152
I don't want to make it like a thing

2178
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:04,480
Boston

2179
01:48:05,248 --> 01:48:06,272
You game changer

2180
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:08,576
Entertaining

2181
01:48:08,832 --> 01:48:09,344
Deny that

2182
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:10,112
Who's awesome

2183
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:13,952
You know and it is agreed about that

2184
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:14,720
Strongly

2185
01:48:15,232 --> 01:48:15,744
I get up

2186
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:16,512
Everybody talk

2187
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:18,048
Even my mom

2188
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:18,816
Was like

2189
01:48:20,608 --> 01:48:22,144
Sure that was a good idea that kind of

2190
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:25,728
And that's what that's all she had to say

2191
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:27,008
Everybody wants

2192
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:27,776
What's the explanation

2193
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:28,800
Can everybody

2194
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:30,592
Especially now

2195
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:31,872
They're looking

2196
01:48:32,128 --> 01:48:32,640
Tumi

2197
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:34,688
To go live I might have break it down

2198
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:36,992
Everybody here south

2199
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:38,272
What

2200
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:41,088
Mansur's what a really mean seriously here's the angle

2201
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:42,624
Here's the upshot

2202
01:48:47,232 --> 01:48:48,512
But I think that kind of

2203
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:50,816
The point I think

2204
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:52,096
I think it speaks for a

2205
01:48:52,352 --> 01:48:52,864
Michelle

2206
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:54,144
I kind of agree

2207
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:55,168
Secrets

2208
01:48:55,424 --> 01:49:01,568
Spoke quite a bit further comment on it honestly that it was awesome

2209
01:49:01,824 --> 01:49:03,360
Understand where he's coming from

2210
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:07,968
What is perspective it is awesome you did exactly what he wanted to do

2211
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:12,576
At the exact response largely

2212
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:16,928
I can't I can't foresee another circumstance

2213
01:49:17,696 --> 01:49:23,840
Outside of him committing a domestic terrorist act where Nick Fuentes would get as much attention from the mainstream

2214
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:25,888
Press and everything

2215
01:49:26,144 --> 01:49:26,912
Then this

2216
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:30,496
Pretty awesome for him this is some

2217
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:31,776
Weird

2218
01:49:33,056 --> 01:49:36,384
That's knocking dark mirror version of a dream

2219
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:38,176
That might have been mine

2220
01:49:38,432 --> 01:49:38,944
When I was

2221
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:45,600
Very young listening to College Dropout you know like just like me

2222
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:52,000
Hangout with ye be cool to be part of his presidential campaign for what it's worth

2223
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:54,304
Nick

2224
01:49:54,560 --> 01:50:00,704
From Chicago

2225
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:06,336
And that's not something that's new so for him it probably is

2226
01:50:06,848 --> 01:50:09,664
I'm cool about that just all cool Liberty

2227
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:11,456
Element of it alone

2228
01:50:11,712 --> 01:50:12,736
Absolute

2229
01:50:12,992 --> 01:50:19,136
Person that you've liked their music for years

2230
01:50:19,392 --> 01:50:23,232
It is so much like that is a dream I would have and then to have it

2231
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:29,632
Be entirely and that your wish

2232
01:50:29,888 --> 01:50:36,032
Honestly you know what that would be like

2233
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:37,568
Wish Foundation Garden

2234
01:50:37,824 --> 01:50:40,384
I loved the Bosstones

2235
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:46,784
I'm screwing up and I would have loved to hang out with them but now Dicky Barrett

2236
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:48,320
God dammit

2237
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:51,904
Don't get too

2238
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:57,280
So despite the fact that speaks for itself Nick decides he's going to beat

2239
01:50:58,560 --> 01:50:59,072
At the risk of

2240
01:50:59,328 --> 01:51:00,096
Astounding

2241
01:51:00,352 --> 01:51:00,864
Tripod

2242
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:05,216
To put a very simple

2243
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:07,520
Bishan Tire system is

2244
01:51:07,776 --> 01:51:08,288
Just put in place to

2245
01:51:09,824 --> 01:51:10,592
Again I know that

2246
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:12,128
You know that's not really

2247
01:51:13,152 --> 01:51:14,176
Not really my most

2248
01:51:15,712 --> 01:51:16,736
What I mean by that is you

2249
01:51:17,248 --> 01:51:18,016
This guy Wareham

2250
01:51:18,784 --> 01:51:19,552
He goes on the Alex

2251
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:21,344
Hitler

2252
01:51:22,112 --> 01:51:23,648
And we're going to stop

2253
01:51:24,672 --> 01:51:25,184
She's all the time

2254
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,280
Of course what's the obvious

2255
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:34,144
Can't say that you can't

2256
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:34,912
I'd say that

2257
01:51:35,424 --> 01:51:36,192
Play that apology

2258
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:38,240
You can't win if

2259
01:51:38,496 --> 01:51:41,312
You say that all that's not a good idea blah blah blah

2260
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:42,592
And

2261
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:43,616
You know I'm just

2262
01:51:43,872 --> 01:51:44,384
Kind of over

2263
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:46,432
In the same way that a 26

2264
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:48,480
16 people are more like you know why

2265
01:51:49,248 --> 01:51:49,760
Shut up

2266
01:51:50,784 --> 01:51:51,552
F*** off

2267
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:53,600
Make America great

2268
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:55,648
Build the wall

2269
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:56,672
Ban all Muslims

2270
01:52:00,256 --> 01:52:02,048
You know I know that's probably not

2271
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:06,656
Word search

2272
01:52:06,912 --> 01:52:07,936
Temperamentally slightly

2273
01:52:08,192 --> 01:52:09,728
Different in that regard that sort of how I would

2274
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:12,032
We don't care

2275
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:14,592
The system is so rude

2276
01:52:15,872 --> 01:52:16,384
Sosa

2277
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:18,176
Skating with so overbearing

2278
01:52:18,944 --> 01:52:19,968
We're so sick of

2279
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:20,992
The double standards

2280
01:52:21,504 --> 01:52:22,272
Apocracy

2281
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:23,552
I really like the

2282
01:52:25,344 --> 01:52:25,856
Real

2283
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:26,880
And the funny

2284
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:28,672
And an honest

2285
01:52:29,696 --> 01:52:30,208
Brutal honesty

2286
01:52:30,976 --> 01:52:34,560
Answer these bucking conventional wisdom that you can't say these things

2287
01:52:35,072 --> 01:52:36,352
In the realm of politics

2288
01:52:36,864 --> 01:52:37,888
And that's

2289
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:40,704
Whatever but

2290
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:43,776
Does conception there

2291
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:44,544
I think

2292
01:52:45,056 --> 01:52:45,824
Make sense

2293
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:48,896
And I'm worried about the experiment

2294
01:52:49,408 --> 01:52:49,920
Because

2295
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:53,248
There was a lot of like with Trump like

2296
01:52:53,504 --> 01:52:55,552
You was talking about like him having a big dick

2297
01:52:55,808 --> 01:52:57,344
Debate stage

2298
01:52:57,600 --> 01:53:01,440
And stuff like that dude like this doesn't work just doesn't fly and then it turns out

2299
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:02,976
Through Brute Force

2300
01:53:03,488 --> 01:53:05,792
And sheared not giving a f***

2301
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:07,072
Somehow it

2302
01:53:07,328 --> 01:53:07,840
Did work

2303
01:53:08,352 --> 01:53:08,864
And

2304
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:12,192
The things that make is articulating here

2305
01:53:12,448 --> 01:53:12,960
Is

2306
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:16,544
That is the way he's approaching being anti-semitic and Pub

2307
01:53:17,824 --> 01:53:19,616
I'm just going to brute-force it

2308
01:53:19,872 --> 01:53:24,992
F*** you well I mean he's he's explaining something I think that is

2309
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:26,784
Well-known

2310
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:30,880
Which is that everybody right now is so f******

2311
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:31,648
Sick

2312
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:34,464
Of listening to people lie to them all the time

2313
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:39,072
Beer politicians or media and you can say all

2314
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:42,400
It's this media that's lying to me or this politician that's lying to you

2315
01:53:42,656 --> 01:53:45,472
But at the end of the day it doesn't matter what side you're on

2316
01:53:45,728 --> 01:53:47,008
There's enough Flyers

2317
01:53:47,264 --> 01:53:49,056
In both your teams

2318
01:53:49,312 --> 01:53:50,080
But you're going to be mad

2319
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:56,224
Yeah you know what people want is authentic cities honesty how they respond to that

2320
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:58,016
Even if it's f****** evil

2321
01:53:58,272 --> 01:54:04,416
Right and that's one of the big selling point to the Trump ad and it's something that and that's something

2322
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:10,816
Yeah you can get into to any has other elements of the archetypes that people gravitated to about drop the ID

2323
01:54:11,072 --> 01:54:16,960
Video of being self-made that authenticity is you brought up just having Fame itself is enough for most major

2324
01:54:17,216 --> 01:54:23,360
Presumably being willing to walk away from Fame and Fortune because of some kind of principal sort of yeah

2325
01:54:23,616 --> 01:54:25,408
He may or may not have

2326
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:28,224
Those things are

2327
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:30,784
Whether true or just illusion

2328
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:33,600
Are things that Translate from

2329
01:54:34,112 --> 01:54:36,160
A trump campaign to a ye campaign

2330
01:54:36,416 --> 01:54:38,720
That they do resume with people

2331
01:54:39,232 --> 01:54:41,024
I mean

2332
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:42,560
I could be wrong

2333
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:49,216
But I don't think people are I don't think the electorate is big enough yet for the honesty of aisle

2334
01:54:49,472 --> 01:54:50,496
I love Hitler no

2335
01:54:50,752 --> 01:54:54,592
When I don't think on the global stage I think it would be a

2336
01:54:55,616 --> 01:55:00,992
I think we'll be tough and I think that my biggest problem with being alive right now is not knowing

2337
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:05,856
If Loving Hitler is a losing electoral strategy for sure I don't like knowing that

2338
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:12,256
Right and that's what I'm saying about like the kit the experiment worries mate what is there is there

2339
01:55:12,512 --> 01:55:15,840
Point at which that brute-forcing of like know f*** this

2340
01:55:16,096 --> 01:55:20,448
I don't care about your your decency ideas and I don't care about your

2341
01:55:20,704 --> 01:55:22,752
Your ideas of what I can and can't say

2342
01:55:23,008 --> 01:55:26,080
Is there a line at which something is too far

2343
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:28,128
I mean I don't want to go

2344
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:29,152
In Georgia

2345
01:55:29,408 --> 01:55:29,920
It is

2346
01:55:30,176 --> 01:55:34,528
A very thin line that you have to go a long way for it

2347
01:55:34,784 --> 01:55:37,600
You got to have lied about some abortions

2348
01:55:37,856 --> 01:55:44,000
You got to have all kinds of terrible wasn't following everything super closely but I heard something about werewolves

2349
01:55:44,256 --> 01:55:45,024
You left

2350
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:46,560
To go that far

2351
01:55:46,816 --> 01:55:48,608
You just barely lose

2352
01:55:48,864 --> 01:55:51,936
How far is got to go so

2353
01:55:52,448 --> 01:55:53,216
So

2354
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:54,240
Yeah and Nick

2355
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:55,264
Apparently

2356
01:55:55,520 --> 01:56:00,896
Good spirits which I agree they're both

2357
01:56:01,152 --> 01:56:02,688
Now more than ever and it's

2358
01:56:02,944 --> 01:56:03,456
It's amazing

2359
01:56:03,712 --> 01:56:04,224
Cuz yeah and I are

2360
01:56:04,992 --> 01:56:05,504
Spirits

2361
01:56:06,272 --> 01:56:07,040
We are really on

2362
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:08,320
On the same wavelength of

2363
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:09,344
Look

2364
01:56:10,112 --> 01:56:11,136
We're going to go out there

2365
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:13,184
Honor Hardware

2366
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:13,952
Going to say

2367
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:14,976
What we feel

2368
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:16,512
And whatever

2369
01:56:17,792 --> 01:56:18,560
The best Frozen

2370
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:20,096
Like with him or with me

2371
01:56:20,608 --> 01:56:21,120
Whatever

2372
01:56:21,632 --> 01:56:22,656
We'll figure it out

2373
01:56:22,912 --> 01:56:24,960
We went before we wind up broke dad

2374
01:56:25,216 --> 01:56:25,728
Murdered by the

2375
01:56:25,984 --> 01:56:26,496
The Jews

2376
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:27,776
Whatever

2377
01:56:28,288 --> 01:56:29,568
Okay like whatever

2378
01:56:33,152 --> 01:56:34,176
Then that's a that's a

2379
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:35,712
Feeling

2380
01:56:35,968 --> 01:56:36,480
Sentiment

2381
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:38,528
There's also a good read

2382
01:56:39,296 --> 01:56:40,832
Like there's also like a

2383
01:56:41,856 --> 01:56:42,880
Cerebral explanation

2384
01:56:43,136 --> 01:56:43,648
For witches

2385
01:56:44,416 --> 01:56:45,184
Look at look at the

2386
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:45,952
This guy

2387
01:56:47,232 --> 01:56:47,744
You did everything

2388
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:48,512
Right

2389
01:56:49,792 --> 01:56:51,584
The American dream he blew up

2390
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:52,864
Doing what he loves.

2391
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:53,632
Cambridge

2392
01:56:53,888 --> 01:56:54,400
Became famous

2393
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:55,424
Became a bit

2394
01:56:56,704 --> 01:56:57,472
Made products

2395
01:56:58,496 --> 01:56:59,008
So on

2396
01:57:01,056 --> 01:57:01,568
Liquid

2397
01:57:01,824 --> 01:57:03,360
When they rip this family apart they

2398
01:57:04,128 --> 01:57:04,640
Kids brought meme

2399
01:57:05,152 --> 01:57:05,920
Who invented

2400
01:57:06,176 --> 01:57:09,248
Lobotomized

2401
01:57:09,504 --> 01:57:10,784
And of course

2402
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:11,552
I'm oversimplifying

2403
01:57:11,808 --> 01:57:12,576
There's more to this

2404
01:57:13,088 --> 01:57:13,600
The Napa

2405
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:15,648
The point is look at the

2406
01:57:15,904 --> 01:57:16,928
The kind of society and

2407
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:17,952
What if

2408
01:57:18,976 --> 01:57:19,488
It's not

2409
01:57:19,744 --> 01:57:20,256
Producing

2410
01:57:21,024 --> 01:57:22,048
Happy healthy

2411
01:57:24,864 --> 01:57:25,888
Still satisfied

2412
01:57:27,424 --> 01:57:28,448
Producing

2413
01:57:29,728 --> 01:57:30,496
It's becoming a

2414
01:57:30,752 --> 01:57:31,264
Impossible

2415
01:57:32,544 --> 01:57:33,312
To build wealth

2416
01:57:33,824 --> 01:57:34,592
You have any symbol

2417
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:35,872
Independence

2418
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:37,152
To have

2419
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:38,432
But I help

2420
01:57:39,456 --> 01:57:40,480
Decent marriage

2421
01:57:40,736 --> 01:57:41,504
Respectable marriage

2422
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:42,528
Which to raise your family

2423
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:43,552
You know what

2424
01:57:43,808 --> 01:57:44,576
Societies making

2425
01:57:44,832 --> 01:57:45,344
All of this

2426
01:57:47,648 --> 01:57:48,672
And So my answer when

2427
01:57:49,184 --> 01:57:49,696
It'll stay like

2428
01:57:50,976 --> 01:57:51,744
Are you can't do this

2429
01:57:52,768 --> 01:57:53,536
Good idea

2430
01:57:54,048 --> 01:57:54,560
You that is

2431
01:57:55,584 --> 01:57:56,096
Why not

2432
01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:57,632
What's the altar

2433
01:57:58,400 --> 01:57:59,424
What are we going to do

2434
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:01,472
Are you going to do

2435
01:58:03,008 --> 01:58:03,520
Alex

2436
01:58:04,288 --> 01:58:04,800
Say I love Hitler

2437
01:58:05,568 --> 01:58:07,104
Abbeville night or we could do a lot of things

2438
01:58:09,152 --> 01:58:14,784
You can see here the way that Nick is able to put his finger on some actual existing social ills

2439
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:17,856
Difficulty people have Building Wealth these days

2440
01:58:18,368 --> 01:58:22,208
He can use the recognition of these problems as a way to rope people in

2441
01:58:22,464 --> 01:58:25,024
An appeal to actual problems they might be Experian

2442
01:58:25,792 --> 01:58:27,840
Then you can blame these problems on the Jews

2443
01:58:28,096 --> 01:58:30,144
Scapegoat that in effect reveals

2444
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:33,472
He doesn't really actually care about those social ills of themselves

2445
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:39,872
Recognizing them and Performing empathy around them are tools that he uses to funnel people into his bigoted

2446
01:58:40,384 --> 01:58:41,664
Question of like

2447
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:43,712
What other choice did they have many

2448
01:58:43,968 --> 01:58:45,248
Most importantly though

2449
01:58:45,504 --> 01:58:46,272
Is that

2450
01:58:46,784 --> 01:58:49,344
The things that they are blaming

2451
01:58:49,856 --> 01:58:50,880
On the Jews

2452
01:58:51,136 --> 01:58:53,184
Are the direct result of

2453
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:54,464
The things they want

2454
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:56,000
Want to happen

2455
01:58:56,512 --> 01:58:59,072
Yeah you know like oh it's harder to build well that's

2456
01:58:59,328 --> 01:58:59,840
Because

2457
01:59:00,352 --> 01:59:02,656
The way the things have been setup is that people

2458
01:59:02,912 --> 01:59:04,704
Who agree with you

2459
01:59:05,216 --> 01:59:08,032
Laws that made it impossible to do that

2460
01:59:08,288 --> 01:59:13,920
It's because of your desires and ideology of the problems your prescribing

2461
01:59:14,176 --> 01:59:18,784
Exist you have to be a little bit careful because I think that would be fairly accurate for Alex

2462
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:20,064
By Knicks

2463
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:26,208
Policy set is not necessarily the same as a lot of the GOP I don't give a s*** what policy

2464
01:59:26,464 --> 01:59:26,976
He said he has

2465
01:59:33,376 --> 01:59:36,192
Nick would be in favor of like government regulation

2466
01:59:36,704 --> 01:59:37,728
For one thing

2467
01:59:39,008 --> 01:59:42,080
That is a fundamental difference between him

2468
01:59:42,336 --> 01:59:44,384
And how Alex would approach

2469
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:46,944
Write some sorts of

2470
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:49,248
Ways the government can intervene

2471
01:59:49,504 --> 01:59:52,576
In things that would restrict people's ability

2472
01:59:52,832 --> 01:59:53,856
To build wealth

2473
01:59:54,112 --> 01:59:54,880
Super example

2474
01:59:55,136 --> 01:59:56,160
I am I'm not

2475
01:59:56,416 --> 02:00:01,280
I'm not saying you should care you are not accurate

2476
02:00:01,792 --> 02:00:03,840
If you are lumping hey man

2477
02:00:04,096 --> 02:00:04,608
With like

2478
02:00:04,864 --> 02:00:05,888
A lot of the

2479
02:00:06,144 --> 02:00:07,424
More libertarian ask

2480
02:00:07,936 --> 02:00:13,312
Policies and governmental ideas to talk about it's a little more,

2481
02:00:15,872 --> 02:00:16,640
Alright

2482
02:00:16,896 --> 02:00:17,664
Turn off

2483
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:19,200
So Nick

2484
02:00:19,456 --> 02:00:20,992
Thinks that people are overthinking things

2485
02:00:21,504 --> 02:00:22,016
I maybe should

2486
02:00:22,272 --> 02:00:23,552
Maybe you just

2487
02:00:23,808 --> 02:00:24,832
B look at things simple

2488
02:00:25,088 --> 02:00:25,600
Okay

2489
02:00:25,856 --> 02:00:26,880
We've reached an impasse

2490
02:00:27,648 --> 02:00:28,416
And it's some point

2491
02:00:28,672 --> 02:00:29,184
People have

2492
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:31,232
And I'm a really big believer in

2493
02:00:31,488 --> 02:00:32,000
Maybe this is

2494
02:00:32,256 --> 02:00:32,768
My age

2495
02:00:33,024 --> 02:00:33,792
Speaking

2496
02:00:34,048 --> 02:00:35,072
Just not even say they did

2497
02:00:35,328 --> 02:00:35,840
Me being a man

2498
02:00:36,096 --> 02:00:36,864
Picture or something

2499
02:00:37,376 --> 02:00:38,144
I think all those things

2500
02:00:38,656 --> 02:00:39,168
Appositive

2501
02:00:41,472 --> 02:00:42,496
A big part of my

2502
02:00:42,752 --> 02:00:43,520
Belief is that

2503
02:00:46,336 --> 02:00:47,104
We are

2504
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:48,128
Overthinking

2505
02:00:49,408 --> 02:00:50,176
And we have thought our

2506
02:00:50,432 --> 02:00:50,944
Ourselves into

2507
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:51,712
Box

2508
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:53,504
Telling ourselves what

2509
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:54,784
We can't do what

2510
02:00:55,296 --> 02:00:56,064
I've Never Been Gone

2511
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:57,088
And what is not pause

2512
02:00:57,344 --> 02:00:57,856
Possible

2513
02:00:58,112 --> 02:00:58,880
We have thought

2514
02:00:59,136 --> 02:00:59,648
Arguing

2515
02:01:00,416 --> 02:01:00,928
Theirselves

2516
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:01,952
Whenever

2517
02:01:05,024 --> 02:01:05,536
What is

2518
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:06,560
Should be done about our

2519
02:01:07,584 --> 02:01:08,096
Meaning

2520
02:01:09,120 --> 02:01:09,888
Can't say this

2521
02:01:10,144 --> 02:01:10,912
Can't do that

2522
02:01:11,168 --> 02:01:11,680
Don't want to go

2523
02:01:11,936 --> 02:01:12,448
Banned on Twitter

2524
02:01:12,704 --> 02:01:13,216
Don't want to lose you

2525
02:01:13,472 --> 02:01:14,240
Your job want to be

2526
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:17,568
Can't do that

2527
02:01:19,104 --> 02:01:20,128
People is come up with these

2528
02:01:20,384 --> 02:01:21,664
Convoluted

2529
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:22,944
Uninspiring

2530
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:25,248
Ridiculous

2531
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:26,016
Strategies

2532
02:01:27,296 --> 02:01:28,320
Elusive populism

2533
02:01:28,576 --> 02:01:30,624
Multiracial working-class pop

2534
02:01:31,136 --> 02:01:31,904
Boo

2535
02:01:32,416 --> 02:01:33,184
Boring

2536
02:01:34,208 --> 02:01:35,744
That's less likely to work

2537
02:01:36,256 --> 02:01:37,280
Been saying you love him

2538
02:01:38,048 --> 02:01:38,816
In my opinion

2539
02:01:40,096 --> 02:01:40,608
People think those are

2540
02:01:40,864 --> 02:01:41,376
Too bad off

2541
02:01:41,632 --> 02:01:42,144
Options

2542
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:43,168
You want to know which one I think

2543
02:01:43,424 --> 02:01:43,936
Worse

2544
02:01:44,448 --> 02:01:45,984
The one that doesn't get me excited

2545
02:01:46,496 --> 02:01:47,264
The one that doesn't

2546
02:01:48,288 --> 02:01:51,360
Grab my attention to give me on Twitter talking about it you know

2547
02:01:51,616 --> 02:01:55,200
Yeah inclusive popular multi-ethnic

2548
02:01:55,456 --> 02:01:58,528
Working-class solidarity are not things that excitement

2549
02:01:58,784 --> 02:01:59,296
Now

2550
02:01:59,552 --> 02:02:00,576
Saying you love Hitler

2551
02:02:01,088 --> 02:02:03,904
I do I do feel like

2552
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:06,208
Just put the Epitaph on Humanity

2553
02:02:06,464 --> 02:02:08,256
Like real honestly like

2554
02:02:08,768 --> 02:02:14,912
If two things are bad I know which one I would choose the one that excites me it's literally what should be on a Humanities Gray

2555
02:02:18,752 --> 02:02:20,288
That's just

2556
02:02:20,544 --> 02:02:22,336
Various now put it on the grave site

2557
02:02:22,592 --> 02:02:28,736
The idea of inclusive populism or multiracial multi

2558
02:02:28,992 --> 02:02:30,528
Ethnic working-class solidarity

2559
02:02:30,784 --> 02:02:33,856
That doesn't elicit feelings of like

2560
02:02:34,112 --> 02:02:35,648
Create work

2561
02:02:35,904 --> 02:02:36,672
It created

2562
02:02:36,928 --> 02:02:38,464
Difficult

2563
02:02:38,976 --> 02:02:41,792
Things that you need to do in order to achieve these goals

2564
02:02:42,048 --> 02:02:42,560
Whereas

2565
02:02:42,816 --> 02:02:47,424
Just saying on Alex's show I like Hitler and then getting a bunch of attention for it

2566
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:49,984
Is f****** easy here's what people like

2567
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:54,080
Let's do the thing that gets what we want

2568
02:02:54,336 --> 02:02:55,616
And here's what people don't like

2569
02:02:56,128 --> 02:02:59,712
Getting the thing you want is actually a process that requires effort

2570
02:02:59,968 --> 02:03:06,112
Involved and time and cooperation and compromise and you're going to have to admit that you're wrong about something if you want to

2571
02:03:06,368 --> 02:03:12,512
Things to improve and I know you don't want to admit that you're wrong about something and I know you would think that you're not wrong about anything but you might be and you

2572
02:03:13,024 --> 02:03:13,792
If I can do it

2573
02:03:14,048 --> 02:03:14,816
Bright

2574
02:03:15,072 --> 02:03:15,840
Nobody wants to hear that

2575
02:03:16,864 --> 02:03:20,960
Might be his Youth and his amateur Edition I need to take

2576
02:03:21,216 --> 02:03:23,264
Point-of-view has much to do with age these days

2577
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:25,824
So now we get to the Alex

2578
02:03:27,104 --> 02:03:28,640
Nick has

2579
02:03:28,896 --> 02:03:30,176
Levi the accusation

2580
02:03:30,432 --> 02:03:32,480
That the Jews got to Alex

2581
02:03:32,992 --> 02:03:35,040
I'm sorry what now they give him a call

2582
02:03:35,808 --> 02:03:36,832
But I wanted to respond

2583
02:03:37,088 --> 02:03:37,856
To The Alex Jones

2584
02:03:40,672 --> 02:03:42,208
You know cuz I basically implied that he

2585
02:03:42,464 --> 02:03:42,976
He got called

2586
02:03:43,488 --> 02:03:44,000
Cheers to

2587
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:46,048
And now I would like to say

2588
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:49,376
To disavow me or whatever

2589
02:03:50,144 --> 02:03:50,656
Disappointing

2590
02:03:51,424 --> 02:03:52,960
You know we did that show last week

2591
02:03:53,472 --> 02:03:53,984
And then

2592
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:54,752
Alex Jones

2593
02:03:55,264 --> 02:03:55,776
Crowder

2594
02:03:57,568 --> 02:03:58,592
And Steven Crowder

2595
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:00,128
A loudmouth

2596
02:04:01,664 --> 02:04:02,176
Atlas

2597
02:04:02,432 --> 02:04:03,968
I'm sorry I know that's negative

2598
02:04:06,272 --> 02:04:06,784
But it's just

2599
02:04:07,296 --> 02:04:08,320
I mean he literally is

2600
02:04:09,088 --> 02:04:10,112
Giant

2601
02:04:11,392 --> 02:04:12,928
This figuratively and literally just

2602
02:04:13,184 --> 02:04:14,464
It's one of these big headed

2603
02:04:14,976 --> 02:04:15,744
Goober

2604
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:16,768
He's not

2605
02:04:17,536 --> 02:04:18,816
Maybe for people that laugh

2606
02:04:19,072 --> 02:04:19,840
Geico commercial

2607
02:04:20,096 --> 02:04:20,608
Marshalls like that

2608
02:04:20,864 --> 02:04:21,632
Kind of stuff is funny

2609
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:22,912
Brass

2610
02:04:23,424 --> 02:04:25,728
And he pretends like he's a lady

2611
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:29,312
Provide Geico commercials funny you might like Crowder

2612
02:04:29,568 --> 02:04:30,848
Shots fired

2613
02:04:31,104 --> 02:04:34,688
Bud what are you riding are you took a long note

2614
02:04:35,456 --> 02:04:38,272
8888 find it so interesting

2615
02:04:38,784 --> 02:04:39,552
Like this

2616
02:04:39,808 --> 02:04:41,344
This is space that we have

2617
02:04:41,856 --> 02:04:42,624
Suddenly walked into

2618
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:43,904
Where

2619
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:45,184
There is a

2620
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:46,720
Actual battle

2621
02:04:47,488 --> 02:04:48,256
Between

2622
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:49,792
Nick Fuentes

2623
02:04:50,048 --> 02:04:51,328
Actually loving Hitler

2624
02:04:52,096 --> 02:04:53,376
And Alex Jones

2625
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:55,936
Actually not liking Hitler

2626
02:04:56,448 --> 02:04:58,496
He actually does not like Hitler

2627
02:04:58,752 --> 02:05:00,544
He said true thing

2628
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:02,080
But even he can't

2629
02:05:02,336 --> 02:05:03,872
Make money around here

2630
02:05:04,128 --> 02:05:08,736
Even in his heart of hearts he can't be like I will still say I love Hitler

2631
02:05:08,992 --> 02:05:11,808
A little bit more time on air for a little bit more money

2632
02:05:12,064 --> 02:05:13,344
Even he can't do it

2633
02:05:14,112 --> 02:05:16,160
That's how much a piece of s*** Nick ports

2634
02:05:16,928 --> 02:05:18,208
True and

2635
02:05:18,464 --> 02:05:24,096
I think that Alex is smart enough to realize that in his branding

2636
02:05:24,352 --> 02:05:26,144
And it is place in the market

2637
02:05:26,656 --> 02:05:27,936
That kind of a pivot

2638
02:05:28,448 --> 02:05:31,264
Might be good for a very short burst

2639
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:34,592
But it is not sustainable and it has the

2640
02:05:35,104 --> 02:05:38,432
High likelihood of tarnishing everything he's done

2641
02:05:38,688 --> 02:05:44,576
In his 30 years on air that conversation as Alex with Nick

2642
02:05:45,088 --> 02:05:46,624
Alex is setting to Nick like

2643
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:47,392
Listen

2644
02:05:47,648 --> 02:05:48,672
It's not part of my brand

2645
02:05:48,928 --> 02:05:54,048
This will ruin what I've done for 30 years this and Nick is saying right now to the world

2646
02:05:54,304 --> 02:05:55,328
I think that's stupid

2647
02:05:55,584 --> 02:05:57,376
Let's fucken say we love Hitler

2648
02:05:57,888 --> 02:05:59,424
And because you won't

2649
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:03,008
I think that the Jews got tangled

2650
02:06:03,264 --> 02:06:08,640
Yep go on crowder and stepped into snake pits and Oh no you're getting bit

2651
02:06:08,896 --> 02:06:14,016
So Alex on crowder shows believed he expressed the belief that he got

2652
02:06:14,272 --> 02:06:16,576
Tricked into being part of a publicity stunt

2653
02:06:16,832 --> 02:06:20,928
And Nick takes issue with that

2654
02:06:23,232 --> 02:06:25,024
Is he goes on there on July 8th

2655
02:06:25,536 --> 02:06:27,328
Operation

2656
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:28,352
Nice.

2657
02:06:29,376 --> 02:06:30,656
That's like first of all

2658
02:06:30,912 --> 02:06:31,936
You wanted that inter

2659
02:06:32,704 --> 02:06:33,216
Are you kidding me

2660
02:06:35,008 --> 02:06:35,776
How are you going to

2661
02:06:36,032 --> 02:06:36,544
Wife

2662
02:06:37,824 --> 02:06:39,360
Try and fly yeah out

2663
02:06:40,896 --> 02:06:41,408
And I don't want to

2664
02:06:41,664 --> 02:06:42,176
Disclose anything

2665
02:06:42,688 --> 02:06:43,456
Public but

2666
02:06:43,712 --> 02:06:44,224
They tried to say

2667
02:06:46,016 --> 02:06:47,296
You should go it didn't workout

2668
02:06:47,808 --> 02:06:49,088
Bengay wanted to go on

2669
02:06:49,856 --> 02:06:50,368
We made it work

2670
02:06:53,184 --> 02:06:54,208
And I laughed

2671
02:06:54,464 --> 02:06:54,976
Talking about

2672
02:06:57,024 --> 02:06:58,304
Have you ever

2673
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:00,096
Diffuse word of our site crash

2674
02:07:00,352 --> 02:07:00,864
Sing like

2675
02:07:02,144 --> 02:07:03,680
Man like you wanted it

02:07:04,192 --> 02:07:05,728
You loved it it was great hundred

2677
02:07:06,496 --> 02:07:07,520
It's going to go down as one of the most

2678
02:07:07,776 --> 02:07:08,288
Famous things

2679
02:07:09,056 --> 02:07:09,824
In Media

2680
02:07:10,336 --> 02:07:11,104
I was huge

2681
02:07:11,872 --> 02:07:13,152
Are you going to go on the

2682
02:07:13,408 --> 02:07:13,920
Crowder

2683
02:07:14,688 --> 02:07:15,200
After you

2684
02:07:15,456 --> 02:07:16,224

Aloft Hitler

2686
02:07:24,416 --> 02:07:25,184
Victim

2687
02:07:26,208 --> 02:07:26,720
You

2688
02:07:27,744 --> 02:07:28,768
You you mean you

2689
02:07:29,024 --> 02:07:30,304
Invited ye out of the

2690
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:31,072
Shell and gave him

2691
02:07:31,584 --> 02:07:32,096
3 hours

2692
02:07:32,608 --> 02:07:33,120
Knowing

2693
02:07:33,376 --> 02:07:34,656
What's going on by the way there

2694
02:07:36,192 --> 02:07:36,704
And push

2695
02:07:40,544 --> 02:07:41,312
And then you going to go in

2696
02:07:41,568 --> 02:07:42,080
PrideStaff

2697
02:07:42,336 --> 02:07:42,848
Steven Crowder

2698
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:47,200
Publicity stunt

2699
02:07:47,456 --> 02:07:48,224
Publicity

2700
02:07:50,272 --> 02:07:51,040
Okay

2701
02:07:51,296 --> 02:07:52,832
Alex Jones

2702
02:07:54,368 --> 02:07:54,880
It's honestly

2703
02:07:55,136 --> 02:07:55,904
Just like insult

2704
02:07:56,416 --> 02:07:56,928
To his audience

2705
02:07:57,696 --> 02:07:58,208
Come on

2706
02:07:59,488 --> 02:08:01,280
Candice Cruz much yeah it is

2707
02:08:01,536 --> 02:08:03,072
It's a fascinating because

2708
02:08:03,328 --> 02:08:05,376
Nick is right I'm so sad

2709
02:08:05,632 --> 02:08:07,168
Skip they're both right

2710
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:13,824
It was a Craftsman plicity stunt Alex probably did get roped into a little more than he wanted

2711
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:17,920
Like he wanted a publicity stunt but it didn't go the way he wanted

2712
02:08:18,944 --> 02:08:24,064
So you know there is this Middle Ground between them like it wasn't an unwilling participant

2713
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:30,464
He just didn't control it the way you eat thought he was going to be able to Alex thought when he agreed to this that he could get what he

2714
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:33,536
Watch it and you did not give him that

2715
02:08:33,792 --> 02:08:34,816
And so now he's Act

2716
02:08:35,072 --> 02:08:36,096
He didn't

2717
02:08:36,352 --> 02:08:40,192
Raven one sitting in the first place exactly

2718
02:08:40,704 --> 02:08:45,568
So also on the Crowder interview Alex speculated that people like

2719
02:08:46,592 --> 02:08:47,360
Richard Spencer

2720
02:08:47,872 --> 02:08:49,920
Have they gay fascination with Hitler

2721
02:08:50,176 --> 02:08:52,992
And then maybe Nick has a fascination with Hitler as well

2722
02:08:55,296 --> 02:08:56,064
And then to say it's a

2723
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:00,672
That's pretty

2724
02:09:02,208 --> 02:09:03,232
And then he goes

2725
02:09:03,488 --> 02:09:04,512
Jake Paul's as gay

2726
02:09:04,768 --> 02:09:05,280
He said that we are

2727
02:09:05,536 --> 02:09:06,560
Homoerotic

2728
02:09:07,328 --> 02:09:07,840
Fastenal

2729
02:09:08,352 --> 02:09:08,864
With Hitler

2730
02:09:09,632 --> 02:09:10,400
Which I don't know what that house

2731
02:09:12,192 --> 02:09:12,960
You know

2732
02:09:13,216 --> 02:09:14,496
Ye said we love everybody

2733
02:09:14,752 --> 02:09:15,520
I would love now

2734
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:17,824
Hitler we love the

2735
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:18,592
Jewish beloved

2736
02:09:18,848 --> 02:09:19,360
Zionist

2737
02:09:20,128 --> 02:09:21,664
Eddie goes well they're gay for Hitler

2738
02:09:22,688 --> 02:09:24,224
Like it's got nothing to do with being gay

2739
02:09:25,504 --> 02:09:26,272
We just love Hitler

2740
02:09:27,552 --> 02:09:29,344
No home okay Hitler I love you

2741
02:09:32,416 --> 02:09:33,440
No homo

2742
02:09:37,536 --> 02:09:38,304
Just downright that's

2743
02:09:38,816 --> 02:09:39,328
The classic

2744
02:09:39,584 --> 02:09:40,096
He was always say

2745
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:43,424
It is they always

2746
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:44,448
Say all well

2747
02:09:45,728 --> 02:09:46,496
Methanol cheese-like

2748
02:09:47,008 --> 02:09:47,520
You know

2749
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:49,312
Do the hand thing

2750
02:09:49,568 --> 02:09:51,360
Aren't they a little you know

2751
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:58,016
That's not the stereotype that I am aware of never ever heard anyone do that

2752
02:09:59,040 --> 02:10:01,856
I'm not heard that and I've not heard

2753
02:10:02,112 --> 02:10:03,904
Be like even sort of bigots

2754
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:05,696
Syracuse eye being a standard attack

2755
02:10:05,952 --> 02:10:07,744
The Jewish people make

2756
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:09,792
Weird

2757
02:10:10,304 --> 02:10:11,328
Brand new.

2758
02:10:11,584 --> 02:10:12,352
Yeah

2759
02:10:12,608 --> 02:10:14,144
Although I do think that

2760
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:16,448
Again I think of it

2761
02:10:17,472 --> 02:10:19,520
Alex's speculations a little

2762
02:10:20,032 --> 02:10:22,336
Out of nowhere

2763
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:25,152
Loves Alex

2764
02:10:26,176 --> 02:10:26,688
What

2765
02:10:26,944 --> 02:10:29,248
Because everybody loves everybody right all forgot say

2766
02:10:29,504 --> 02:10:30,784
But it was f****** week

2767
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:33,856
Go on Steven Crowder show

2768
02:10:34,368 --> 02:10:35,904
You know and here's the thing like I love Alex

2769
02:10:37,184 --> 02:10:38,208
I think it's a good man

2770
02:10:39,232 --> 02:10:41,280
He's a hero he's a legendary broadcaster

2771
02:10:42,304 --> 02:10:43,584
Never had a problem with him

2772
02:10:44,608 --> 02:10:46,400
But that him running

2773
02:10:48,192 --> 02:10:48,960
Just like a sad

2774
02:10:49,984 --> 02:10:51,520
Move and just like Marjorie

2775
02:10:52,032 --> 02:10:53,056
Doing the cabin McCarthy

2776
02:10:53,824 --> 02:10:54,592

02:10:56,128 --> 02:10:56,640
Sade

2779
02:10:57,152 --> 02:10:57,664
If I

2780
02:10:57,920 --> 02:10:58,944
Permitted to call Dad

2781
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:00,224
What is showing

02:11:01,504 --> 02:11:03,552
Cruciate what's really going on

2784
02:11:04,064 --> 02:11:04,576
Which is like

2785
02:11:05,344 --> 02:11:05,856
All these

2786
02:11:06,624 --> 02:11:07,136
AR

2787
02:11:07,648 --> 02:11:10,208
Control they're all controlled DA's revealing it

2788
02:11:11,488 --> 02:11:12,000
Yep

2789
02:11:12,256 --> 02:11:13,280
A anybody but

2790
02:11:13,536 --> 02:11:14,304
What does whiny loser

2791
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:19,680
He's turned on Marjorie Taylor Greene now too if you didn't know that they have

2792
02:11:19,936 --> 02:11:21,728
Falling out of good graces

2793
02:11:21,984 --> 02:11:24,288
Farewell

2794
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:27,104
Penetration of this Nazi base

2795
02:11:28,128 --> 02:11:32,224
Boys have to get the mood not to base if you want salad

2796
02:11:32,736 --> 02:11:34,016
What was that movie

2797
02:11:35,552 --> 02:11:37,088
There's a movie that the Nazis out of Moonbase

2798
02:11:37,856 --> 02:11:38,880
I don't know I don't know

2799
02:11:39,136 --> 02:11:39,904
Anyway

2800
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:42,464
What are the things that makes me a little bit scared

2801
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:43,488
More of Nick

2802
02:11:43,744 --> 02:11:45,536
Then some of these other figures

2803
02:11:45,792 --> 02:11:48,352
Is it that he does have the ability to make a metaphor

2804
02:11:50,144 --> 02:11:51,680
Manny this is on

2805
02:11:51,936 --> 02:11:52,704
F****** precedent

2806
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:53,984
Many times

2807
02:11:54,240 --> 02:12:00,384
Alex will try to spin a metaphor along time to Nick

2808
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:02,688
Has a metaphor about the Joker

2809
02:12:03,200 --> 02:12:03,968
But actually

2810
02:12:04,224 --> 02:12:05,248
Works pretty well okay

2811
02:12:06,272 --> 02:12:06,784
He's been saying

2812
02:12:07,552 --> 02:12:08,320
You know I'm like

2813
02:12:09,088 --> 02:12:10,112
You're all like I want to be like

2814
02:12:10,624 --> 02:12:11,392
Superhero

2815
02:12:12,928 --> 02:12:14,208
Reset the other day in the office

2816
02:12:17,792 --> 02:12:18,560
And I was dying

2817
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:20,608
But it's true

2818
02:12:21,376 --> 02:12:22,144
You know because

2819
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:23,168
Like your Alex

2820
02:12:23,424 --> 02:12:25,728
John's near Marjorie Taylor Greene there they're like the other

2821
02:12:25,984 --> 02:12:26,752
Criminals in gotha

2822
02:12:27,264 --> 02:12:27,776
The Dark Knight

2823
02:12:29,312 --> 02:12:30,336
They're like the mob boss

2824
02:12:31,616 --> 02:12:33,664
And they bringing they bring in Joker

2825
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:34,432
Kill the Batman

2826
02:12:34,688 --> 02:12:35,968
You know they bringing gay

2827
02:12:36,224 --> 02:12:40,320
For the publicity

2828
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:42,880
Whatever it is on their website

2829
02:12:44,416 --> 02:12:45,696
And it's like

2830
02:12:45,952 --> 02:12:46,464
I don't know who

2831
02:12:46,976 --> 02:12:47,488
Is the line I think

2832
02:12:50,304 --> 02:12:52,096
They brought in something they didn't fully under

2833
02:12:52,352 --> 02:12:54,144
Understand someone to see the world burn

2834
02:12:56,192 --> 02:12:56,960
Astro

2835
02:12:57,984 --> 02:12:58,752
It's all just like how the

2836
02:12:59,008 --> 02:12:59,520
Criminals brain

2837
02:13:00,032 --> 02:13:01,568
Joker and Joker Burns all the money

2838
02:13:02,592 --> 02:13:03,104
And says

2839
02:13:03,616 --> 02:13:04,128
You care about it

2840
02:13:05,152 --> 02:13:06,176
Counters a better class

2841
02:13:06,432 --> 02:13:06,944
Criminal

2842
02:13:07,200 --> 02:13:08,480
And they're all like horrified

2843
02:13:08,736 --> 02:13:11,552
I don't like in their criminals they killed people their murderers

2844
02:13:11,808 --> 02:13:12,832
Who is this

2845
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:14,880
At the same thing as like Alex Jones

2846
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:17,184
They bring this guy in

2847
02:13:23,328 --> 02:13:23,840
Child is better

2848
02:13:24,096 --> 02:13:24,864
Class a Nazi

2849
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:29,472
So

2850
02:13:29,984 --> 02:13:31,520
And then it's people like me I'm like I'm like

2851
02:13:32,032 --> 02:13:32,544
Angry dog

2852
02:13:35,104 --> 02:13:35,616
Free dog

2853
02:13:37,152 --> 02:13:37,664
And I

2854
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:39,712
Yeah

2855
02:13:40,224 --> 02:13:42,272
I think that metaphor makes

2856
02:13:42,528 --> 02:13:43,552
Quite a bit of sense

2857
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:49,952
Criminals and Gotham had a particular problem

2858
02:13:50,208 --> 02:13:52,256
I was late bringing the Joker

2859
02:13:52,512 --> 02:13:55,328
Is it better for Alex has a particular problem

2860
02:13:55,584 --> 02:13:57,120
Amides eyes on his product

2861
02:13:57,376 --> 02:13:59,424
Publicity

2862
02:13:59,680 --> 02:14:02,496
Great amount of attention so he brings in the Joker

2863
02:14:02,752 --> 02:14:06,080
And they didn't understand what they were bringing

2864
02:14:07,104 --> 02:14:10,176
It's it makes complete sense I mean yes

2865
02:14:10,688 --> 02:14:12,736
The thing that is annoying about it

2866
02:14:12,992 --> 02:14:13,760
Is the

2867
02:14:14,016 --> 02:14:15,808
Complete and bracing of

2868
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:17,856
Just being like yeah we're the Bad Guy

2869
02:14:19,136 --> 02:14:19,904
We do

2870
02:14:20,160 --> 02:14:26,304
We know for me please play The Imperial March from the Star Wars free pianos

2871
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:27,072
Annoying

2872
02:14:27,328 --> 02:14:28,352
It is over.

2873
02:14:29,376 --> 02:14:31,936
It is a little pretense of like

2874
02:14:32,704 --> 02:14:34,752
Still wanting to win can be like

2875
02:14:35,008 --> 02:14:41,152
That's making it look like we're acknowledging we're on the bedside but we ask

2876
02:14:41,408 --> 02:14:47,040
We know that we're on the good side and you're just making it look like that but we're actually annoying

2877
02:14:48,576 --> 02:14:50,112
But V

2878
02:14:51,904 --> 02:14:52,928
It is that like

2879
02:14:53,696 --> 02:14:57,280
Yode the destroying of the money and stuff is the

2880
02:14:57,536 --> 02:14:58,560
Is essentially

2881
02:14:58,816 --> 02:15:01,376
Puncturing the game

2882
02:15:01,632 --> 02:15:03,168
That the propagandists are playing

2883
02:15:03,424 --> 02:15:05,984
People like Alex

2884
02:15:06,496 --> 02:15:10,592
The thing that they didn't realize the Joker or ye was going to do

2885
02:15:10,848 --> 02:15:15,200
Is not so much the like actually costing the money or anything like that

2886
02:15:15,712 --> 02:15:16,736
It's that like

2887
02:15:17,248 --> 02:15:18,272
You guys are

2888
02:15:18,528 --> 02:15:19,296
Third

2889
02:15:19,808 --> 02:15:22,112
You can't play a crypto game with me

2890
02:15:22,368 --> 02:15:28,256
I am going to just call out the chaos here I am unfiltered unfettered

2891
02:15:28,512 --> 02:15:33,632
So Nick take some issue here with Alex because Alex was that

2892
02:15:33,888 --> 02:15:34,656
You saying that

2893
02:15:34,912 --> 02:15:37,728
He stood up for Nick and Nick never stood up for him

2894
02:15:37,984 --> 02:15:38,752
And

2895
02:15:39,008 --> 02:15:39,520
That's bulshit

2896
02:15:40,288 --> 02:15:42,336
You know he said oh you know why

2897
02:15:42,592 --> 02:15:43,104
Stood up for dicks

2898
02:15:43,872 --> 02:15:45,408
She's never show me any love it's like

2899
02:15:46,176 --> 02:15:46,688
I am

2900
02:15:46,944 --> 02:15:47,456
Have talked about

2901
02:15:48,992 --> 02:15:50,528
I have always been one of the

2902
02:15:51,296 --> 02:15:51,808
Wants to cover

2903
02:15:52,320 --> 02:15:53,600
The lawsuit

2904
02:15:54,368 --> 02:15:54,880
Understand man

2905
02:15:55,648 --> 02:15:57,440
Set the ship against him I'm always mentioning

2906
02:15:57,952 --> 02:15:59,232
The same breath as everybody else

2907
02:16:00,768 --> 02:16:02,048
So that's just simply not true

2908
02:16:03,584 --> 02:16:05,888
But when you did the other day was kind of

2909
02:16:06,144 --> 02:16:07,680
He had ample

2910
02:16:08,192 --> 02:16:08,704
Call Mia

2911
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:09,472
Nazi

2912
02:16:09,728 --> 02:16:10,240
ER

2913
02:16:10,752 --> 02:16:12,288
Call Carlos de nada

2914
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:13,312
Or what

2915
02:16:14,336 --> 02:16:15,104
How to say all that

2916
02:16:17,408 --> 02:16:17,920
A week later.

2917
02:16:18,176 --> 02:16:19,456
And cries about it to Crowder

2918
02:16:20,480 --> 02:16:20,992
I'm a bit

2919
02:16:21,504 --> 02:16:22,272
The publicity stunt

2920
02:16:22,528 --> 02:16:23,552
Are these terrible Nazi

2921
02:16:23,808 --> 02:16:25,088
Please I'm just a humble water fill

2922
02:16:25,344 --> 02:16:25,856
Filter

2923
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:27,648
You know no trumpet

2924
02:16:28,928 --> 02:16:30,208
Patriot salesman

2925
02:16:30,464 --> 02:16:32,256
Please please don't cancel me

2926
02:16:32,768 --> 02:16:35,072
And you know the thing is like there's dirt layers

2927
02:16:35,328 --> 02:16:36,096
Of course

2928
02:16:36,352 --> 02:16:36,864
Alex

2929
02:16:37,888 --> 02:16:38,656
But he also

2930
02:16:39,168 --> 02:16:40,704
Presumably have Zionist backers

2931
02:16:41,216 --> 02:16:41,728
Like no doubt

2932
02:16:43,008 --> 02:16:44,032
I think even told me that

2933
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:45,568
First time I ever went on a

2934
02:16:47,104 --> 02:16:47,616
Commercial break

2935
02:16:48,128 --> 02:16:49,664
First thing I talked about was Israel

2936
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:52,480
Any cotton during the commercial break and said like hey

2937
02:16:52,736 --> 02:16:54,016
I'm not telling you what to say you can

2938
02:16:54,272 --> 02:16:55,040
Say whatever you want

2939
02:16:55,552 --> 02:16:57,600
But I recommend like not talking

2940
02:16:57,856 --> 02:16:58,624
King about Israel

2941
02:16:59,136 --> 02:17:00,672
The Jew thing or whatever

2942
02:17:00,928 --> 02:17:02,976
He goes but that's just not going to get you anywhere

2943
02:17:03,232 --> 02:17:04,000
We have a lot of Grey

2944
02:17:04,256 --> 02:17:05,024
Why Jewish list

2945
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:07,072
Something like that it was like

2946
02:17:07,328 --> 02:17:08,352
4 years ago I don't really

2947
02:17:08,608 --> 02:17:09,120
Remember

2948
02:17:10,400 --> 02:17:11,424
First time I was

2949
02:17:13,984 --> 02:17:15,008
Don't get no don't play

2950
02:17:15,264 --> 02:17:16,288
Stupid everybody knows

2951
02:17:16,544 --> 02:17:17,056
That's how it goes

2952
02:17:17,312 --> 02:17:17,824
Everybody knows

2953
02:17:19,616 --> 02:17:21,152
So I think

2954
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:23,456
If I were to guess

2955
02:17:23,968 --> 02:17:27,040
There was a conversation the first time Nick was on

2956
02:17:27,296 --> 02:17:28,320
And Alex

2957
02:17:28,576 --> 02:17:29,856
Knowing that Nick is a knot

2958
02:17:30,112 --> 02:17:36,256
I know that open not this s*** right was trying to get him to do the same thing that you did with yay

2959
02:17:36,512 --> 02:17:37,792
And because Nick

2960
02:17:38,048 --> 02:17:44,192
Wasn't a mega celebrity like he he didn't have a place in the market that was higher in value

2961
02:17:44,448 --> 02:17:46,752
You then being on Alex's show

2962
02:17:47,008 --> 02:17:48,544
Along with it and now he

2963
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:51,872
He's contextualizing that is Alex having Jewish owners

2964
02:17:52,128 --> 02:17:53,664
Your handlers are whatever

2965
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:54,432
And this

2966
02:17:54,688 --> 02:17:58,272
This is something that will play with Uno

2967
02:17:58,528 --> 02:17:59,040
Nick's audio

2968
02:17:59,296 --> 02:18:00,320
I mean as opposed

2969
02:18:00,576 --> 02:18:01,344
Just being like

2970
02:18:01,600 --> 02:18:02,624
See the way it works

2971
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:09,024
Status is Alex was higher than me before but now I'm higher than Alex so I could engage in the same behaviors that Alex did

2972
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:10,816
However because I'm higher status

2973
02:18:11,072 --> 02:18:12,608
You'll forgive me for doing it

2974
02:18:12,864 --> 02:18:19,008
And I can make you blame him for doing it perfectly think it's more than he's potentially higher status

2975
02:18:19,264 --> 02:18:20,544
Hello

2976
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:24,896
It's hard to tell what with Alex's woes right now

2977
02:18:25,152 --> 02:18:26,432
I feel like

2978
02:18:26,688 --> 02:18:27,968
Higher status of his own

2979
02:18:28,224 --> 02:18:34,368
No no absolutely not he definitely ahead of Alex

2980
02:18:34,624 --> 02:18:35,392
Clear that

2981
02:18:35,648 --> 02:18:40,512
If I was a betting man I would say hubris and pride will be his downfall

2982
02:18:40,768 --> 02:18:46,912
As is the case with people exactly like this throughout history over and over and over and over and over again

2983
02:18:47,424 --> 02:18:47,936
Feel like

2984
02:18:48,192 --> 02:18:48,960
Make that is a

2985
02:18:49,216 --> 02:18:55,360
Very distinct possibility

2986
02:18:55,616 --> 02:19:00,224
Had a manic episode and decided to unleash his anti-Semitism across the world and then sudden the house

2987
02:19:00,480 --> 02:19:03,808
Found me in that I tagged along it's actually because I'm great

2988
02:19:05,856 --> 02:19:10,464
Conceivably Alex got a call from these dudes handlers that he has

2989
02:19:11,488 --> 02:19:13,024
Betty wants to go and cry I saw it

2990
02:19:14,560 --> 02:19:15,328
He's crying about how I

2991
02:19:15,584 --> 02:19:16,096
He said he got a phone

2992
02:19:16,352 --> 02:19:16,864
SoundCloud

2993
02:19:17,120 --> 02:19:18,656

02:19:22,496 --> 02:19:23,008

02:19:43,232 --> 02:19:43,744
Diana's bath

You know Israel did 9/11

3011
02:19:46,304 --> 02:19:48,352
You know about Jewish influence you know about it

3012

She talked about other shows

20 years ago

3014
02:19:51,424 --> 02:19:51,936
David Duke

02:19:52,192 --> 02:19:53,472
Debated you into the ground on this

3016
02:19:54,496 --> 02:19:55,264

From Jefferson

3021
02:20:01,152 --> 02:20:01,920
You got a call from

You want you wanted

Do more with less

3029
02:20:15,488 --> 02:20:16,000
In other words

3030
02:20:16,768 --> 02:20:17,280
You want to have a

3031
02:20:17,536 --> 02:20:18,816
Big Show while saying

3032
02:20:20,096 --> 02:20:20,608
Fine

3033
02:20:20,864 --> 02:20:21,632
That's your decision

3034
02:20:22,144 --> 02:20:23,424
You're entitled to make that two

3035
02:20:24,960 --> 02:20:26,752
But but you know we all see

3036
02:20:27,008 --> 02:20:27,520
Right through this

3037
02:20:28,032 --> 02:20:29,824
What are you talkin about Ivan

3038
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:31,360
What are you implying

3039
02:20:32,128 --> 02:20:32,896
Here's what I'm implying

3040
02:20:33,152 --> 02:20:33,664
You got a call for

3041
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:34,688
Diana's bath

3042
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:36,480
That was a big problem

3043
02:20:37,504 --> 02:20:39,296
Okay and that's why you pressed yay about

3044
02:20:40,576 --> 02:20:41,856
You know and he was myth

3045
02:20:42,112 --> 02:20:43,648
That the whole show is about Hitler

3046
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:45,440
Please watch a show he kept pushing

3047
02:20:45,696 --> 02:20:46,720
And pushing and pushing

3048
02:20:47,488 --> 02:20:49,280
You know you can't just let the guy say he loves

3049
02:20:50,048 --> 02:20:51,072
God forbid anybody

3050
02:20:52,096 --> 02:20:52,864
Like that

3051
02:20:53,376 --> 02:20:54,400
Coming back and coming back

3052
02:20:54,912 --> 02:20:55,424
What about the uniform

3053
02:20:56,960 --> 02:20:57,472
What you mean is this

3054
02:20:57,984 --> 02:20:59,008
He said what he said

3055
02:20:59,264 --> 02:21:00,288
He said what he said

3056
02:21:01,568 --> 02:21:04,128
You are not going to argue somebody

3057
02:21:04,640 --> 02:21:05,408
If there

3058
02:21:05,664 --> 02:21:06,944
Inherent position

3059
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:08,992
Is the only reason

3060
02:21:09,504 --> 02:21:11,040
That you would dislike Hitler

3061
02:21:11,552 --> 02:21:14,368
Is because you got a call from extremely powerful Jewish

3062
02:21:15,904 --> 02:21:16,928
If that's your big

3063
02:21:17,184 --> 02:21:17,696
Getting possessed

3064
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:20,256
Right where's the argument going to start

3065
02:21:20,768 --> 02:21:21,536
Nowhere

3066
02:21:21,792 --> 02:21:27,936
It's a disaster as bad as saying that because I think I'm gone I'm out of here

3067
02:21:29,472 --> 02:21:33,312
The implication here is kind of interesting cuz if you unpack this

3068
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:40,224
I think what Nick is saying is that like you know how like Republican

3069
02:21:40,480 --> 02:21:45,344
Organizations will buy bulk purchases of people's books in order put them on the bestseller list

3070
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:49,952
He seems to be implying that there are zionists handlers

3071
02:21:50,208 --> 02:21:53,792
Or backers or whatever who buy a bunch of Alex's supplements

3072
02:21:54,048 --> 02:21:55,840
I was finances work or something

3073
02:21:56,096 --> 02:21:57,632
I don't think that's the case

3074
02:21:58,144 --> 02:22:00,192
Weird yeah

3075
02:22:00,448 --> 02:22:01,472
I don't I don't think

3076
02:22:01,984 --> 02:22:04,032
Okay so here's my business

3077
02:22:04,544 --> 02:22:06,848
I am going to get a bunch of

3078
02:22:08,128 --> 02:22:10,176
Our own labels on bulshit pills

3079
02:22:10,432 --> 02:22:14,272
And then some weirdo billionaires are just going to buy those

3080
02:22:14,528 --> 02:22:16,064
Move them from my warehouse

3081
02:22:16,576 --> 02:22:17,344
To their warehouse

3082
02:22:17,856 --> 02:22:18,880
Where they'll just sit and wait

3083
02:22:19,392 --> 02:22:20,416
Sure I mean

3084
02:22:21,440 --> 02:22:22,464
I don't know

3085
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:23,232
I think

3086
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:24,512
It would be

3087
02:22:25,024 --> 02:22:31,168
I mean I guess all of the callers who say they use the products could be lying but I don't know I don't

3088
02:22:31,424 --> 02:22:32,192
Smiletastic

3089
02:22:33,216 --> 02:22:36,288
But yeah this is it this is why you don't get mixed up with someone like Nick

3090
02:22:37,312 --> 02:22:40,128
Cuz like he has some actual good points here

3091
02:22:40,384 --> 02:22:42,432
Yeah that is that David Duke

3092
02:22:42,688 --> 02:22:48,832
Did out debate Alex autograph out debate Robert Barnes

3093
02:22:49,088 --> 02:22:50,624
Infowars

3094
02:22:50,880 --> 02:22:51,904
But

3095
02:22:52,160 --> 02:22:57,280
The then the conclusion that he jumps to that Alex is behaving the way he is bi

3096
02:22:57,536 --> 02:23:00,864
Because some Jewish handlers told him to

3097
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:04,704
Completely unearned and there isn't any reason to believe that right

3098
02:23:05,216 --> 02:23:10,336
There is everything is explained by a very simple Occam's razor that is

3099
02:23:10,592 --> 02:23:11,872
That there is a certain

3100
02:23:12,128 --> 02:23:14,176
Blue Point past which Alex's business model

3101
02:23:14,432 --> 02:23:16,224
Is no longer viable

3102
02:23:16,480 --> 02:23:18,272
Nick is push past that point

3103
02:23:18,528 --> 02:23:19,040
And

3104
02:23:19,296 --> 02:23:20,576
It has nothing to do with

3105
02:23:20,832 --> 02:23:21,600
Jewish influence

3106
02:23:22,112 --> 02:23:26,720
Threatening Alex are coming down on him Overton profit window

3107
02:23:26,976 --> 02:23:29,024
Is everything to do with just

3108
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:32,096
Simple understanding your place in the mark

3109
02:23:32,864 --> 02:23:34,400
And

3110
02:23:35,936 --> 02:23:36,704
Claim that

3111
02:23:36,960 --> 02:23:38,752
Like some sort of Nefarious thing but

3112
02:23:39,520 --> 02:23:45,664
Well the thing is quartz his f****** show like in his parents basement he's he's got a nice little spot for himself right now.

3113
02:23:45,920 --> 02:23:47,456
Because he doesn't actually have a play

3114
02:23:47,968 --> 02:23:48,480
In the meeting

3115
02:23:48,992 --> 02:23:50,016
Everything he's doing

3116
02:23:50,272 --> 02:23:51,040
Clawing a place

3117
02:23:51,296 --> 02:23:51,808
For himself

3118
02:23:52,064 --> 02:23:52,576
It's all

3119
02:23:52,832 --> 02:23:53,344
Destructive

3120
02:23:53,600 --> 02:23:55,904
Exactly the sort of

3121
02:23:56,160 --> 02:24:00,768
Privateering he doesn't have to defend anything he's wearing the armor of being a Nazi

3122
02:24:01,024 --> 02:24:07,168
Defend this takes time and I love I said I love Hitler what

3123
02:24:07,424 --> 02:24:11,264
Be mean to me about you can't hurt me because that

3124
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:16,640
And so all he has to do is point out the incredibly obvious bulshit that everybody's doing

3125
02:24:16,896 --> 02:24:20,224
Because it's incredibly obvious it doesn't take a genius to be like

3126
02:24:20,480 --> 02:24:26,624
Oh Alex is exploiting people yeah you're a f****** brilliant and it's just it's just such an easy spot to

3127
02:24:26,880 --> 02:24:28,416
The problem is

3128
02:24:28,672 --> 02:24:29,952
Once he get something

3129
02:24:30,208 --> 02:24:33,024
Then he's going to go through the process of trying to hold on

3130
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:34,816
Does something right

3131
02:24:35,328 --> 02:24:35,840
Definitely

3132
02:24:36,096 --> 02:24:37,888
So Nikki

3133
02:24:38,144 --> 02:24:40,704
Unfortunately a little bit yes peelings

3134
02:24:41,216 --> 02:24:43,776
And he feels bad that everyone keeps throwing them under the bus

3135
02:24:44,288 --> 02:24:44,800
Pretty kind of under

3136
02:24:45,056 --> 02:24:45,568
Costanza

3137
02:24:45,824 --> 02:24:46,592
Very annoying

3138
02:24:47,360 --> 02:24:48,896
And you know

3139
02:24:49,152 --> 02:24:49,920
You got all these days

3140
02:24:50,432 --> 02:24:51,200
People that are much older than

3141
02:24:51,456 --> 02:24:52,736
The me like Marjorie or Alex

3142
02:24:52,992 --> 02:24:53,504

3143
02:24:55,808 --> 02:24:57,856
And constantly throwing me under the bus

3144
02:24:58,112 --> 02:24:58,624
Steve Ferrone

3145
02:24:59,648 --> 02:25:00,160
Dislike

3146
02:25:00,672 --> 02:25:01,184

Like I am

3148
02:25:02,464 --> 02:25:02,976

Meet all these two

3150
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:04,768

My bike character is pretty on a

3159
02:25:16,032 --> 02:25:21,920
Teachable life or something like that

3160
02:25:22,176 --> 02:25:25,248
I'm not a hater I have a big hard-on

3161
02:25:26,016 --> 02:25:28,064
I'm just like a lovable guy want to make a

3162
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:29,088
The funny show

3163
02:25:29,600 --> 02:25:32,160
And and I believe it all the same things all these

3164
02:25:32,416 --> 02:25:32,928
People do

3165
02:25:33,184 --> 02:25:34,208
And they just have like no

3166
02:25:34,464 --> 02:25:35,232
Compunction about life

3167
02:25:35,488 --> 02:25:36,512
Slitting my throat

3168
02:25:36,768 --> 02:25:37,536
If it makes their life

3169
02:25:39,072 --> 02:25:40,352
You know it's like Marjorie

3170
02:25:40,864 --> 02:25:41,376

Shook my hand gave me a hug

3172
02:25:43,424 --> 02:25:43,936
Davis Beach

3173
02:25:44,960 --> 02:25:45,472
All this

3174
02:25:46,496 --> 02:25:47,008
Pretends not to

3175
02:25:47,264 --> 02:25:49,056
Janome the day after okay fine

3176
02:25:49,568 --> 02:25:50,080
You know you got to say

3177
02:25:50,336 --> 02:25:50,848
What you got to say

3178
02:25:51,360 --> 02:25:51,872
But you got to like

3179
02:25:52,128 --> 02:25:52,640
Denounce

3180
02:25:52,896 --> 02:25:53,664
What's my views

3181
02:25:54,944 --> 02:25:55,456
Anti-Semitic

3182
02:25:57,248 --> 02:25:58,528
Because she got pressure

3183
02:25:58,784 --> 02:25:59,296
Sure from the Jewish

3184
02:25:59,808 --> 02:26:00,320
She got pressure

3185
02:26:00,832 --> 02:26:01,600
McCarthy at the arch

3186
02:26:02,112 --> 02:26:02,624
Seeing all back

3187
02:26:03,904 --> 02:26:05,184
And she's like oh yeah

3188
02:26:05,440 --> 02:26:05,952
I'll totally pushed

3189
02:26:07,232 --> 02:26:07,744
Traffic

3190
02:26:08,256 --> 02:26:09,024
To make my life easier

3191
02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:10,048
Easier

3192
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:15,680
I didn't believe until quite recently that the Jews had space lasers the stick used

3193
02:26:15,936 --> 02:26:17,216
Control weather

3194
02:26:17,728 --> 02:26:23,360
Yeah this is like Azazel in Hell being like he's there's a lot of demons around here what's going on

3195
02:26:23,616 --> 02:26:29,760
Around here has just started to realize that

3196
02:26:30,016 --> 02:26:36,160
Integrity loyal bunch

3197
02:26:36,928 --> 02:26:42,816
I wonder why I gravitated to them in the first place probably not important not going to think about it

3198
02:26:43,072 --> 02:26:44,352
Impeachable character

3199
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:45,888
So

3200
02:26:46,144 --> 02:26:47,936
Meeting ye was amazing

3201
02:26:48,192 --> 02:26:52,544
That again probably was because his love for a long time

3202
02:26:52,800 --> 02:26:53,824
Meeting Alex

3203
02:26:54,080 --> 02:26:54,592
Which was not

3204
02:26:55,360 --> 02:26:56,640
It's a breath of fresh air to me

3205
02:26:56,896 --> 02:26:57,408
Somebody's a

3206
02:26:57,664 --> 02:26:58,944
True American original

3207
02:26:59,456 --> 02:27:02,528
And I truly somebody's free you mean Alex Jones

3208
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:04,320
The first time I went on his life

3209
02:27:05,856 --> 02:27:06,624
Say whatever you want

3210
02:27:09,184 --> 02:27:09,696
And I was like

3211
02:27:14,560 --> 02:27:15,584
You know don't get me wrong you still

3212
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:16,352
So funny

3213
02:27:17,120 --> 02:27:18,400
Workhorse

3214
02:27:18,656 --> 02:27:19,168
Incredible

3215
02:27:20,192 --> 02:27:21,216
But I was

3216
02:27:21,472 --> 02:27:22,496
When I heard that out

3217
02:27:23,264 --> 02:27:23,776
Deflated

3218
02:27:24,032 --> 02:27:24,800
Was like all your knots

3219
02:27:29,920 --> 02:27:30,944
Guy doing a show

3220
02:27:31,712 --> 02:27:32,480
You're good show

3221
02:27:32,736 --> 02:27:33,248
Hodor

3222
02:27:33,760 --> 02:27:34,272
But it's like

3223
02:27:34,528 --> 02:27:35,040
That was my

3224
02:27:36,064 --> 02:27:37,600
Give me like some contrast like either

3225
02:27:37,856 --> 02:27:38,368
The first time I wear

3226
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:39,392
Michelle

3227
02:27:40,672 --> 02:27:41,184
Commercial break

3228
02:27:42,208 --> 02:27:43,744
Whatever you want

3229
02:27:44,256 --> 02:27:44,768
Don't talk about the Jew

3230
02:27:47,328 --> 02:27:49,632
Are the Jewish things that Dad and I was like

3231
02:27:51,680 --> 02:27:52,704
That's like what my parents

3232
02:27:53,984 --> 02:27:54,496
That's so cool

3233
02:27:55,520 --> 02:27:56,032
Alex

3234
02:27:56,800 --> 02:27:57,312
Absolute

3235
02:27:59,616 --> 02:28:00,128
You know

3236
02:28:00,640 --> 02:28:01,408
He's telling me the same

3237
02:28:01,664 --> 02:28:02,176
Stuff my

3238
02:28:02,432 --> 02:28:03,200
My Boomer parents

3239
02:28:04,992 --> 02:28:05,504
Really good idea

3240
02:28:06,016 --> 02:28:06,784
Did you really say that

3241
02:28:07,296 --> 02:28:07,808
I love my girl

3242
02:28:12,160 --> 02:28:18,048
The other normally like that there normally like well my son is Hitler

3243
02:28:18,816 --> 02:28:19,840
I hope he's not too Hitler

3244
02:28:20,096 --> 02:28:23,168
Toby grows out of the Hitler stuff like that is

3245
02:28:23,424 --> 02:28:24,704
Is that.

3246
02:28:24,960 --> 02:28:25,472
I don't know

3247
02:28:25,728 --> 02:28:27,008
Ground him something

3248
02:28:27,520 --> 02:28:28,544
Takeaway is allowance

3249
02:28:28,800 --> 02:28:29,312
Again

3250
02:28:29,568 --> 02:28:31,104
Never meet your Heroes though you know

3251
02:28:31,360 --> 02:28:34,688
Next very disappointed by Alex's non

3252
02:28:34,944 --> 02:28:38,528
Embracing of the Nazi lifestyle to me up about this

3253
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:43,136
Is how empty all of this is if it also includes like

3254
02:28:43,392 --> 02:28:49,536
I still think he's a great guy and I think all of this s*** that's like that blows my mind

3255
02:28:49,792 --> 02:28:50,304
I disagree with

3256
02:28:51,840 --> 02:28:52,352
Because

3257
02:28:52,608 --> 02:28:54,144
Nick recognizes that

3258
02:28:54,400 --> 02:28:57,216
Alex is still doing something that serves his interest

3259
02:28:57,984 --> 02:28:58,752
And that is

3260
02:28:59,008 --> 02:29:01,312
Being the more introductory step

3261
02:29:01,568 --> 02:29:03,360
People can come into

3262
02:29:03,616 --> 02:29:04,384
Knicks

3263
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:05,408
Stream

3264
02:29:05,664 --> 02:29:09,248
Or he's River much easier if there's a tributary threaten like Alex

3265
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:11,296
There where you're coming from

3266
02:29:11,552 --> 02:29:14,112
Even if he is some kind of a shell or whatever

3267
02:29:14,368 --> 02:29:17,440
Nick is awareness the people who get sucked into that

3268
02:29:17,696 --> 02:29:18,720
Have a tendency to

3269
02:29:18,976 --> 02:29:19,744
Grow past

3270
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:24,352
Alex's material Nikita harder drugs

3271
02:29:24,608 --> 02:29:26,144
Obviously not empty for him

3272
02:29:26,400 --> 02:29:32,544
Yes

3273
02:29:34,848 --> 02:29:36,640
So makes fun of

3274
02:29:36,896 --> 02:29:40,736
Alex it's like he's going to go insane

3275
02:29:40,992 --> 02:29:42,784
Hitler Hitler parted hair

3276
02:29:43,808 --> 02:29:44,320
Who is that for

3277
02:29:45,344 --> 02:29:46,880
For the Jews like who is that bore

3278
02:29:47,392 --> 02:29:49,696
Nobody is rigged with that nobody is impressed

3279
02:29:49,952 --> 02:29:50,464
Why you said

3280
02:29:50,976 --> 02:29:51,488
MARSOC

3281
02:29:55,072 --> 02:29:57,120
Don't cut yourself on that edge

3282
02:29:57,376 --> 02:29:58,144
Bro I like

3283
02:29:58,400 --> 02:29:58,912
I see why your face

3284
02:30:00,960 --> 02:30:01,984
Does not want you to

3285
02:30:02,240 --> 02:30:02,752
Another was a

3286
02:30:03,264 --> 02:30:03,776
Democrat

3287
02:30:04,544 --> 02:30:05,568
Dam Ali

3288
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:06,848
Go off

3289
02:30:07,104 --> 02:30:08,640
Jesus said Hitler burn in hell

3290
02:30:09,408 --> 02:30:11,200
Absolute Madman

3291
02:30:11,712 --> 02:30:13,504
Woohoo Ladd

3292
02:30:15,296 --> 02:30:21,440
This playground should does not fly it at like oh you think my mom is fat Houck

3293
02:30:21,696 --> 02:30:22,208
Cool

3294
02:30:22,464 --> 02:30:23,488
No no no dude

3295
02:30:23,744 --> 02:30:24,768
You love him

3296
02:30:25,024 --> 02:30:30,144
That I mean there's no you can't be like oh how cool is it that he doesn't like Heather no f*** you

3297
02:30:30,400 --> 02:30:32,704
Doesn't work on this one

3298
02:30:32,960 --> 02:30:33,472
The Forgotten

3299
02:30:33,728 --> 02:30:36,800
The only reason this is actually kind of like

3300
02:30:37,056 --> 02:30:39,360
Maybe a dangerous point for Alex

3301
02:30:39,872 --> 02:30:42,176
Is that he is a free-speech absolutist

3302
02:30:42,688 --> 02:30:43,456
And it is

3303
02:30:43,712 --> 02:30:47,040
That he is like he fancies himself the tip of the spear

3304
02:30:47,296 --> 02:30:48,320
And like this

3305
02:30:48,576 --> 02:30:54,720
This kind of like dangerous edgy censored person that you've been censored by everybody

3306
02:30:54,976 --> 02:30:57,792
And your censorious toward someone else

3307
02:30:58,048 --> 02:31:01,376
Do kind of hold a little bit of a trump card on you

3308
02:31:01,632 --> 02:31:07,264
There is a little bit of a power that this person who has been censored by the guy who's against censorship

3309
02:31:07,520 --> 02:31:10,336
Right because you can't argue with that person

3310
02:31:10,592 --> 02:31:12,640
That Hitler can't be the tip of the spear

3311
02:31:13,664 --> 02:31:18,016
Well you know like you can't argue with Nick you can't be like hey know I get what you're saying

3312
02:31:18,272 --> 02:31:22,112
But you think that being edgy memes Hitler

3313
02:31:22,368 --> 02:31:23,392
When in reality

3314
02:31:23,904 --> 02:31:24,672
Your

3315
02:31:24,928 --> 02:31:25,440
Just

3316
02:31:26,464 --> 02:31:32,608
Loving Hitler that's the end of this conversation we got over a while ago

3317
02:31:32,864 --> 02:31:39,008
It's genocide I don't know what else to describe it as it's not an interesting conversation that Society refuse

3318
02:31:39,264 --> 02:31:43,104
Uses to have it's a conversation that we had and we've moved along

3319
02:31:43,616 --> 02:31:45,408
It's just you're trying to rehash it for

3320
02:31:45,664 --> 02:31:51,808
Yeah most of society is 100% on that there's no middle ground on Hitler

3321
02:31:55,136 --> 02:31:58,464
So also f*** Crowder and maybe Marjorie Taylor Greene

3322
02:32:01,280 --> 02:32:01,792
Scapegoat

3323
02:32:02,048 --> 02:32:03,072
Like we get to attack

3324
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:04,352
Nick

3325
02:32:04,608 --> 02:32:05,120
For being the nice

3326
02:32:05,888 --> 02:32:06,912
We're just going to pretend like

3327
02:32:07,168 --> 02:32:08,192
Aiden said

3328
02:32:09,728 --> 02:32:11,520
Everybody wants to throw me under the bus

3329
02:32:12,032 --> 02:32:12,544
Whatever

3330
02:32:12,800 --> 02:32:13,824
I'll remember that

3331
02:32:14,336 --> 02:32:14,848
Also

3332
02:32:15,872 --> 02:32:17,152
Here's a real last

3333
02:32:18,432 --> 02:32:20,736
None of the people that threw me out of the bus are really

3334
02:32:20,992 --> 02:32:21,504
Even that impressed

3335
02:32:22,528 --> 02:32:23,808
I have never watch Crowder

3336
02:32:24,320 --> 02:32:24,832
I think I watched a

3337
02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:27,648
Crowder's

3338
02:32:27,904 --> 02:32:28,416
Not Wiegand

3339
02:32:30,464 --> 02:32:31,232
You know so crowded

3340
02:32:31,488 --> 02:32:32,000
Disavowing me

3341
02:32:33,536 --> 02:32:34,816
Marjorie Taylor Greene

3342
02:32:35,584 --> 02:32:36,096
You like

3343
02:32:36,352 --> 02:32:36,864
You know

3344
02:32:38,912 --> 02:32:39,936
I've already

3345
02:32:43,008 --> 02:32:43,520
Looks like

3346
02:32:44,288 --> 02:32:46,336
Does anybody really think so like if I had my

3347
02:32:46,592 --> 02:32:47,616
Choice that I'd be like

3348
02:32:48,640 --> 02:32:49,408
Standing with Margie

3349
02:32:49,664 --> 02:32:50,176
Retailer green

3350
02:32:51,456 --> 02:32:54,528
Like listen you got to play with the hand you're dealt I'll just put it out

3351
02:32:56,576 --> 02:32:59,648
Marjorie Taylor Greene danowski let's say is like no love lost

3352
02:33:01,440 --> 02:33:02,208
Honestly

3353
02:33:02,720 --> 02:33:03,488
Deshawn for McCarthy

3354
02:33:03,744 --> 02:33:04,256
And she was still

3355
02:33:04,768 --> 02:33:05,792
Backpack that would be

3356
02:33:07,072 --> 02:33:07,840
That would

3357
02:33:08,864 --> 02:33:09,376
Be bad

3358
02:33:09,632 --> 02:33:10,400
For me.

3359
02:33:13,216 --> 02:33:14,240
Blue pill weekly

3360
02:33:14,496 --> 02:33:15,264
I'm trying not to swear

3361
02:33:15,776 --> 02:33:20,640
Cuz Kanye doesn't like it yeah

3362
02:33:20,896 --> 02:33:21,408
About

3363
02:33:21,664 --> 02:33:22,944
You're somebody who's associating with

3364
02:33:23,968 --> 02:33:24,480
Is that

3365
02:33:24,736 --> 02:33:25,504
He seemed

3366
02:33:25,760 --> 02:33:28,064
To be fully in support of Marjorie

3367
02:33:28,320 --> 02:33:30,112
Back when they were on good terms

3368
02:33:30,368 --> 02:33:32,672
I know that they are falling out

3369
02:33:33,184 --> 02:33:39,328
He's being a little bit more open about like I wouldn't have wanted to work with her but no one else wanted to work

3370
02:33:42,656 --> 02:33:48,032
You play with the hand you're dealt at this is one big exercise in the emperor has no clothes

3371
02:33:48,288 --> 02:33:49,568
Kind of

3372
02:33:51,616 --> 02:33:52,896
Hey man just being like

3373
02:33:53,152 --> 02:33:57,760
Look at all these losers like that's that's again that's what makes me so empty for me is that yes

3374
02:33:58,016 --> 02:33:59,296
They are a bunch of losers

3375
02:34:00,832 --> 02:34:01,344
Did you see that

3376
02:34:01,600 --> 02:34:02,880
You are a bigger loser

3377
02:34:03,392 --> 02:34:09,536
Yeah it's me it's that same Dynamic that he has when he's talking about social issues then sometimes he's able to descriptively

3378
02:34:09,792 --> 02:34:15,936
Text get his finger on something that is an actual problem but his analysis and

3379
02:34:16,192 --> 02:34:16,704
Assertive

3380
02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:17,472
Other

3381
02:34:17,984 --> 02:34:20,032
Conversation around things is

3382
02:34:20,288 --> 02:34:21,312
Maybe worse

3383
02:34:21,568 --> 02:34:22,592
Definitely worse

3384
02:34:22,848 --> 02:34:23,360
Or meaning

3385
02:34:23,616 --> 02:34:29,760
And he has put his finger on a very real thing year that is funny and he's vaping

3386
02:34:30,272 --> 02:34:33,856
Nobody would want to work with Marjorie Taylor Greene if they had another choice

3387
02:34:34,112 --> 02:34:34,624
And

3388
02:34:34,880 --> 02:34:35,648
Complicated

3389
02:34:36,160 --> 02:34:38,208
Everything else around it

3390
02:34:38,720 --> 02:34:41,024
Is bad and he is worse it just

3391
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:45,888
Any does it is so much more desirable I mean it if I were if I were not

3392
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:48,448
Listening to Alex and MPG

3393
02:34:48,960 --> 02:34:50,752
It is so much more desirable

3394
02:34:51,264 --> 02:34:54,336
To listen to the kid who says that the emperor has no clothes

3395
02:34:54,592 --> 02:34:56,896
Because I knew it the whole f****** time

3396
02:34:57,152 --> 02:34:57,920
But they are

3397
02:34:58,176 --> 02:35:02,016
Told me because they all love each other that actually know they're great

3398
02:35:02,272 --> 02:35:04,576
The finally I have not seen that I can love

3399
02:35:04,832 --> 02:35:07,392
Who is willing to admit that every other not because an a******

3400
02:35:09,184 --> 02:35:09,952
Which makes

3401
02:35:10,976 --> 02:35:11,744
It does make some sense

3402
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:12,512
Yeah

3403
02:35:13,024 --> 02:35:13,792
Sonic

3404
02:35:14,048 --> 02:35:15,328
He likes to see the good in people

3405
02:35:16,352 --> 02:35:17,632
Like Richard Spencer

3406
02:35:18,144 --> 02:35:20,192
Here's some of the good that makes season Richardson

3407
02:35:21,216 --> 02:35:23,008
Let's see who else or any other big blue checks

3408
02:35:23,264 --> 02:35:24,032
Senior Buzz besides

3409
02:35:25,312 --> 02:35:26,336
What time I call the Mom

3410
02:35:26,592 --> 02:35:27,872
On the phone I was like hell rich

3411
02:35:28,384 --> 02:35:28,896
He was like

3412
02:35:42,208 --> 02:35:42,720
511

3413
02:35:42,976 --> 02:35:45,280
See that's the type of humor you can't get on crowder show

3414
02:35:45,792 --> 02:35:46,304
Well not only

3415
02:35:46,816 --> 02:35:47,328
I mean that is his name

3416
02:35:49,632 --> 02:35:50,144
That is his name

3417
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:52,192
I don't think that

3418
02:35:53,216 --> 02:35:54,240
You know out of line.

3419
02:35:54,752 --> 02:35:55,520
Want to be called the sir

3420
02:36:03,200 --> 02:36:04,480
That's helpful.

3421
02:36:05,504 --> 02:36:06,016
That's how I'mma

3422
02:36:06,272 --> 02:36:07,552
The van one of my favorites

3423
02:36:07,808 --> 02:36:10,368
See you know we find when we like about people you find what you

3424
02:36:10,624 --> 02:36:11,136
Walkabout

3425
02:36:11,392 --> 02:36:16,256
People that's got it that's a great story Richard Spencer said it's Richard not rich

3426
02:36:17,792 --> 02:36:18,816
What a guy so funny

3427
02:36:19,072 --> 02:36:25,216
I'm going to guess that there was something else that happened in that conversation that makes him memorable

3428
02:36:25,728 --> 02:36:29,056
It may be Richards listening and nose

3429
02:36:29,568 --> 02:36:31,872
Otherwise that it's Rich story

3430
02:36:32,128 --> 02:36:33,152
Is a little flat

3431
02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:35,200
Not a lot going on there

3432
02:36:35,456 --> 02:36:35,968
Also

3433
02:36:36,224 --> 02:36:36,736
F******

3434
02:36:36,992 --> 02:36:38,272
So infuriating

3435
02:36:38,528 --> 02:36:39,552
In so infuriating

3436
02:36:39,808 --> 02:36:42,112
What if it said it's

3437
02:36:42,624 --> 02:36:43,392
Raven

3438
02:36:43,904 --> 02:36:44,672
Order pizza.

3439
02:36:44,928 --> 02:36:45,440
Oh

3440
02:36:45,952 --> 02:36:49,536
Only I would have a bigger problem with calling them by something that they wanted to be called

3441
02:36:50,048 --> 02:36:50,560
Sure

3442
02:36:51,584 --> 02:36:52,096
Sure

3443
02:36:53,120 --> 02:36:55,168
So we have one last

3444
02:36:55,424 --> 02:36:55,936
Scorpio

3445
02:36:57,984 --> 02:37:00,032
Very exciting big breaking news

3446
02:37:01,056 --> 02:37:02,592
How about the new song.

3447
02:37:02,848 --> 02:37:03,360
Right

3448
02:37:04,896 --> 02:37:05,408
DeBary FL

3449
02:37:06,688 --> 02:37:07,200
What new song

3450
02:37:07,968 --> 02:37:08,736
Gales Garden Center

3451
02:37:10,272 --> 02:37:12,320
Like anybody and I don't know why maybe for the Alex

3452
02:37:12,576 --> 02:37:13,344
John sample

3453
02:37:15,392 --> 02:37:15,904
He took out the

3454
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:16,672
Play I love Hitler

3455
02:37:17,440 --> 02:37:18,976
The one the version that I heard

3456
02:37:19,232 --> 02:37:23,840
It ended with that I love that I love that I love about Hitler

3457
02:37:26,400 --> 02:37:26,912
But that's okay

3458
02:37:27,936 --> 02:37:28,960
That's okay we know what he meant

3459
02:37:29,216 --> 02:37:29,728
Yep

3460
02:37:29,984 --> 02:37:31,008
So this is pretty funny

3461
02:37:31,264 --> 02:37:34,848
Gary posted this song on Instagram which seems like a strange

3462
02:37:35,104 --> 02:37:41,248
Considering what he's been yelling about Instagram of the sex trafficking operation at anyone who clicks a like button on a woman's picture is sex

3463
02:37:42,272 --> 02:37:47,904
They removed the song apparently and then he sent it to Alex and posted it on Infowars at the headline

3464
02:37:48,160 --> 02:37:49,952
Yale releases epic new song

3465
02:37:50,208 --> 02:37:54,048
Exclusively on Infowars

3466
02:37:54,304 --> 02:37:54,816
The fuc

3467
02:37:55,072 --> 02:37:57,120
It's an exclusive release because it got taken offense

3468
02:37:57,376 --> 02:37:58,144
Oh my God

3469
02:37:58,656 --> 02:38:00,704
And yeah after all of this

3470
02:38:00,960 --> 02:38:05,312
After everything that's happened Alex is still super anxious to post

3471
02:38:05,568 --> 02:38:08,896
There's no continuity in the new show

3472
02:38:09,152 --> 02:38:10,432
There's a new monster of the week

3473
02:38:10,688 --> 02:38:12,992
I know I got burned by this publicity stunt anyways

3474
02:38:13,248 --> 02:38:17,344
I'm going to release that single baby come on now

3475
02:38:17,600 --> 02:38:18,368
Sheesh

3476
02:38:18,624 --> 02:38:24,768
Play the song pretty but it's really bad suspected the reason it got taken off Instagram was because he use samples that he hadn't

3477
02:38:25,024 --> 02:38:27,584
I'm cleared there might have been like a copyright issue there

3478
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:33,728
I don't think it'll be a hit if only because he includes a lyric about how God won't let him have sex until he's married again

3479
02:38:35,264 --> 02:38:37,824
Just kids are getting

3480
02:38:38,336 --> 02:38:39,360
That's the new punk rock

3481
02:38:40,896 --> 02:38:46,016
That's the new put new punk rock is no sex before marriage baby

3482
02:38:46,528 --> 02:38:47,296
Cool cowboy

3483
02:38:49,344 --> 02:38:51,648
This is this is where we're at

3484
02:38:52,928 --> 02:38:54,720
Marketplace is not a good place

3485
02:38:54,976 --> 02:38:55,744
Snow not

3486
02:38:57,280 --> 02:38:58,304
It just not I think

3487
02:38:58,560 --> 02:39:04,448
I think that it is important to understand like some of these Dynamics within this right-wing

3488
02:39:04,704 --> 02:39:07,008
Ecosystem in terms of how

3489
02:39:07,520 --> 02:39:08,544
There is this

3490
02:39:08,800 --> 02:39:10,336
Dual-use of

3491
02:39:10,592 --> 02:39:11,104
Yay

3492
02:39:11,360 --> 02:39:15,712
Ladies there's the ideal version which is recruiting him and getting him to cool it

3493
02:39:15,968 --> 02:39:19,040
Right on some of this stuff that is going to be bad for business

3494
02:39:19,552 --> 02:39:22,112
Omn failing that beer

3495
02:39:22,624 --> 02:39:24,672
And then failing that there's the

3496
02:39:24,928 --> 02:39:25,952
The using him

3497
02:39:26,208 --> 02:39:29,024
Like everyone used to use Alex and still does

3498
02:39:29,536 --> 02:39:30,816
When they need to

3499
02:39:31,328 --> 02:39:33,632
Maybe I'm not him person right

3500
02:39:34,656 --> 02:39:36,960
So there's that MMI I just think it's

3501
02:39:37,216 --> 02:39:38,752
Really interesting to hear next

3502
02:39:39,008 --> 02:39:40,800
Response because there is some

3503
02:39:41,568 --> 02:39:43,616
Analysis of dynamic

3504
02:39:44,128 --> 02:39:45,152
Between these figures

3505
02:39:45,408 --> 02:39:46,944
That he understand

3506
02:39:47,456 --> 02:39:48,224
Clearly

3507
02:39:48,480 --> 02:39:48,992
A Mac

3508
02:39:49,248 --> 02:39:52,064
Is something you don't really hear people talk about

3509
02:39:52,320 --> 02:39:54,112
Within the circles very much

3510
02:39:54,368 --> 02:39:54,880
Exactly

3511
02:39:55,136 --> 02:39:55,904
I think that's

3512
02:39:56,416 --> 02:39:57,696
That's what's so

3513
02:40:00,256 --> 02:40:01,792
Empty I think what's soda SEPTA

3514
02:40:02,048 --> 02:40:03,584
Give about it is because

3515
02:40:03,840 --> 02:40:05,632
He is willing to say the things

3516
02:40:05,888 --> 02:40:06,912
Things that everybody knows

3517
02:40:07,424 --> 02:40:10,752
People give him more credit for being able to see through this camera

3518
02:40:11,008 --> 02:40:12,032
When in reality they are

3519
02:40:12,288 --> 02:40:13,056
See-through the scam

3520
02:40:13,312 --> 02:40:14,848
He's just the only one who is

3521
02:40:15,104 --> 02:40:16,128
Making his scam

3522
02:40:16,640 --> 02:40:17,152
Pointing it out

3523
02:40:17,408 --> 02:40:22,272
Yes you know like he's just making his own little scam that he's got going on but

3524
02:40:23,040 --> 02:40:23,808
It's it's

3525
02:40:24,064 --> 02:40:25,344
Counter to the

3526
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:28,928
The ecosystem that sustains itself with that interlocking

3527
02:40:29,184 --> 02:40:35,328
King scams and that is a large reason essentially why he's not going to be involved

3528
02:40:35,584 --> 02:40:36,864
In a lot of these other folks

3529
02:40:38,912 --> 02:40:39,424
Alex

3530
02:40:39,680 --> 02:40:43,264
In his interview with Crowder said that he would have went as back on

3531
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:44,800
But it would need to be a debate

3532
02:40:45,312 --> 02:40:46,336
Auntie

3533
02:40:46,592 --> 02:40:48,384
I don't want to guarantee I've been wrong about

3534
02:40:48,640 --> 02:40:49,152
So much

3535
02:40:49,408 --> 02:40:51,200
I don't think that's going to happen

3536
02:40:51,712 --> 02:40:54,016
The reason

3537
02:40:54,272 --> 02:40:55,040
Pasta note

3538
02:40:55,296 --> 02:41:00,416
Nick would dance circles around me be sad

3539
02:41:00,672 --> 02:41:01,952
Nick Cannon Dodge

3540
02:41:02,464 --> 02:41:05,024
Is beyond Alex's capacity to punch

3541
02:41:05,536 --> 02:41:07,840
The things that Nick can say

3542
02:41:08,096 --> 02:41:08,864
They will

3543
02:41:09,120 --> 02:41:09,888
Confuse Alex

3544
02:41:10,144 --> 02:41:11,424
Will be too much

3545
02:41:11,936 --> 02:41:13,728
I'll go even simpler than that

3546
02:41:14,240 --> 02:41:15,520
Alex would have to prepare

3547
02:41:17,056 --> 02:41:17,568
I mean

3548
02:41:17,824 --> 02:41:20,640
So really the end

3549
02:41:22,176 --> 02:41:23,456
If you wanted to

3550
02:41:24,224 --> 02:41:24,992
Engaged

3551
02:41:25,248 --> 02:41:30,880
In that the way that he would engage in it didn't seem to prepare that much for David Duke

3552
02:41:31,392 --> 02:41:31,904
Nope

3553
02:41:33,184 --> 02:41:33,696
Anyway

3554
02:41:33,952 --> 02:41:36,256
This all is a mess

3555
02:41:37,280 --> 02:41:37,792
And

3556
02:41:38,048 --> 02:41:44,192
Maybe we'll go back to checking in on Infowars and Alex show itself next week we'll see apparently wearing

3557
02:41:44,448 --> 02:41:46,752
The palace Intrigue with a conservative propaganda

3558
02:41:47,776 --> 02:41:53,920
I think it's an elevated slightly it is it is it is I realized you I realized

3559
02:41:54,176 --> 02:41:54,688
Paris to you

3560
02:41:54,944 --> 02:41:58,016
There was a little bit of that saying that there wasn't

3561
02:41:58,272 --> 02:42:04,416
Extreme there was nothing I didn't notice that is just kind of fun like him yelling

3562
02:42:04,672 --> 02:42:10,304
Crowder

3563
02:42:10,560 --> 02:42:11,840
I'm fine with that

3564
02:42:12,096 --> 02:42:16,704
There's also an element of it that the cathartic necessities

3565
02:42:16,960 --> 02:42:18,752
It's so f****** obvious

3566
02:42:19,008 --> 02:42:21,312
You don't get involved with people like this

3567
02:42:21,568 --> 02:42:22,336
Because

3568
02:42:22,592 --> 02:42:24,384
That's what they'll do to you

3569
02:42:24,640 --> 02:42:27,712
They are going to smear you they're going to use things

3570
02:42:27,968 --> 02:42:29,760
That you may have said in confidence

3571
02:42:30,016 --> 02:42:31,040
Answer private or

3572
02:42:31,296 --> 02:42:31,808
Or something

3573
02:42:32,064 --> 02:42:33,344
And they will take those things

3574
02:42:33,856 --> 02:42:36,416
And then present them to their audience as

3575
02:42:36,672 --> 02:42:40,000
Some kind of evidence that you're involved in fairies plot

3576
02:42:40,256 --> 02:42:41,280
You know it's

3577
02:42:41,536 --> 02:42:45,120
Just stay away, don't get involved it is it is like

3578
02:42:45,376 --> 02:42:47,424
Part of me is

3579
02:42:47,680 --> 02:42:50,240
This is like here's what should be required reading

3580
02:42:50,496 --> 02:42:54,336
For third graders and it should be for every day of the year and that's just fat

3581
02:42:54,848 --> 02:42:59,200
Like just really get into understanding what the devil's bargain mean

3582
02:42:59,456 --> 02:42:59,968
You know like

3583
02:43:00,224 --> 02:43:03,296
At third grade you're 8 or 9 years old you're ready

3584
02:43:03,552 --> 02:43:09,440
To figure out what unintended consequences are it's time to hammer it home at a young age be nice

3585
02:43:09,696 --> 02:43:11,488
So Jordan

3586
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:12,768
Welcome to the end of this

3587
02:43:13,024 --> 02:43:16,352
And I would also like to say thank you to Amanda for some help

3588
02:43:16,608 --> 02:43:17,632
With us

3589
02:43:19,936 --> 02:43:20,448
But until then

3590
02:43:20,704 --> 02:43:25,568
We have Vella website.com

3591
02:43:25,824 --> 02:43:27,104
Yep we'll be back

3592
02:43:27,360 --> 02:43:27,872
Until then

3593
02:43:28,384 --> 02:43:30,432
Emilio Emilio I'm dvx.

3594
02:43:32,992 --> 02:43:34,016
I didn't think of a new bit

3595
02:43:37,856 --> 02:43:38,880
You have been doing lately

3596
02:43:39,392 --> 02:43:45,536
Let's not a lot more frosting than I'd like to admit

3597
02:43:45,792 --> 02:43:51,680
Frosting than you'd like to admit the amount of frosting that you would like to admit to eat at like 1 dunkaroo

3598
02:43:51,936 --> 02:43:54,496
Morgan Carew package
