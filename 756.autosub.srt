Air Jordan

00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Dot-com

5
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,072

00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,912
M4u top

7
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:14,240
Jordan is

8
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:17,056
You know I'm a pretty

9
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:17,824
Even

10
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,920
Kill type of fellow you are monotonous

11
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:25,248
So my tip monotone you keep it level

12
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:28,320
Yeah I'm so excited for fun

13
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,344
I'm going to get high

14
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,720
I'm going to force I'm going to force getting high

15
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,768
About something in advance

16
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,984
Fire Fire Emblem game is coming out in January

17
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,032
So I'm going to artificially be

18
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:54,432
Market Pub I'm kind of excited I'm excited to play it it looks real

19
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:59,040
I'm going to I'm going to overdo it probably a little bit

20
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,320
Just ever

21
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:06,720
Sort of as a bit but then also have an extra I see if like maybe maybe hyperworks on Me Maybe you

22
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,512
Where the skin of somebody with her

23
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:12,608
Hydrite maybe I'd like all this feels right

24
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:19,008
But yeah it's it looks good looks good that's the only thing I'm worried about is it takes away what I love so much about three houses

25
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,800
Which was being it's in a school

26
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:23,616
Yeah it's where is it I don't know

27
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,944
Well that doesn't

28
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,040
Now that I say this out loud I have no idea

29
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:35,136
I just saw a tiny little video

30
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,696
Anyway turn-based RPG fun

31
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,864
Hi yeah you you just you just went from being eyeball the way down till you back to level again

32
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,704
I don't have the energy for this

33
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,240
What's a ride

34
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:54,080
My bright spot is I saw my wife and I saw

35
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,128
Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio

36
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,432
Absolutely stellar

37
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:01,248
Really really good like the movies good but

38
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,808
The stop-motion animation is the best thing

39
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:10,720
There's this there's this team can you tell me what the movie is again really quick okay yeah that's what I thought you said

40
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,792
I got distracted cuz I saw the date

41
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:17,376
And I thought it was a palindrome but then I realized it was last year

42
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:23,264
12 11211 would have been

43
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,568
Play Pinocchio

44
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:35,040
Sorry about as interesting as possible palindromes distractible

45
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,832
Paradox

46
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,904
No just a bunch of there's this one scene

47
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,696
Stop motion animation

48
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,720
Where there's this

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,584
Floating balloon this slightly floating balloon the type that you know where

50
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,704
The string is just barely touching and it's a little bit above that it's so

51
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,776
It's incredible. It's it's mind-blowing we good

52
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,824
Is it super dark

53
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,616
No I mean

54
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:07,552
The original Pinocchio do you remember that

55
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:14,208
I don't remember all the details but I remember it being darker than the Disney version

56
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,744
So yeah it's a little bit like that

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,512
But with

58
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:20,863
Guillermo del Toro monsters so it seems a lot darker than it really is just cuz he

59
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:24,959
His monster design is so you know monsters you be like

60
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,263
This is a fun kids story with a

61
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:33,663
Of dark elements drifted a little closer to h.r. Giger and I were in the Hall of uncanny

62
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,199
Valley Music

63
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:41,855
Episode to do where we going back to the past 2003

64
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,647
5th 2003

65
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,463
And the reason for this is

66
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,767
We've been discovered

67
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,303
Stuff

68
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,863
The ye business

69
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,655
Alex's responds to it

70
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,215
Is a bit of quintessence of I think this stuff is really important

71
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:01,311
To discuss an important to cover we're not going to not

72
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,615
Continue to do or we going to

73
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,663
Not

74
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,711
Follow Alex in the present

75
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,247
Inside of course

76
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:12,063
I think you run the risk

77
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,879
If we only talk

78
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:18,463
About that stuff it gives a overwhelming

79
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,999
Perception of

80
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,279
Of maybe how

81
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,583
Uniform it is

82
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:30,239
You know what I mean like if I was all that about the listeners taking in too much of that in like

83
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,031
Giving the sense that we

84
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,311
Think that

85
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:38,175
Everything all around is white supremacist the Nazis jumping up

86
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:43,807
I need a little break from time to time a little break he is a little brain

87
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,855
The past is great

88
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,391
Respa

89
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,671
Absolutely

90
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,207
And the present sucks

91
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:55,583
Really learning anything in the present generally it's kind of watching

92
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,887
Stuff and being like oh this is bad

93
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,703
Where's when you go back to the path there's actually like

94
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:06,079
Illuminating things their stories that are interesting that has implications

95
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,639
To learn things about the way Alex

96
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,455
His brand has evolved over the years

97
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:16,831
And I I think that that is something that I find the far more captivating than

98
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,599
Him

99
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:18,879
Failing

100
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,415
To interview

101
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,719
A couple of guys who loved me

102
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,767
No I mean what's interesting about the past

103
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,047
Does that when you can look at the

104
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,583
Something and then see what kind

105
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,607
Consequences did

106
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:32,191
Occur there's a lot more interesting

107
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,495
Stuff to be learned from that because you have

108
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,775
Actual evidence

109
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,335
What will happen if you do this thing in this circumstance

110
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:42,175
Where is if you stay in the present all too often I mean if it does feel like we're

111
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:47,039
Constantly within the same framework and Minor Details are changing you know

112
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:53,439
Vic Fuentes hasn't said something new we haven't heard about white supremacist before you don't have tunnel vision saying

113
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:58,047
Presents a little bit to better way to express what I am

114
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,839
I don't want to

115
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,167
M play into

116
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,447
Listen to notes fight

117
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,471
You're not going to be putting

118
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:11,871
The tunnel tunnels

119
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:16,735
Purdue Dartmouth say hello to the new Wok Super Snake be in Austin

I'm a policy wonk

122
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,367

You talk about Don D walk

130
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,847
Is better

131
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,615
I mean

132
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,663
You know what

133
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,943
I'm going to sit this one out

134
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:53,343
You know that song that you know the song Honky Tonk Badonkadonk

135
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,743
Why I want to stay away from this because my disdain for all of it it no gray was a big

136
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:04,351
You hear that the karaoke bar is back when I was going to those ones on the outskirts

137
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,935
So Town call there was a time where someone made me line dance

138
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:14,335
So yeah that awkward moment when you realize your name reminds Jordan of Richard Spencer thank you so much you're in Alabama

00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:38,399
I was Brandon saying that he loves Emily.

143
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:44,799
No there is no just like Emily any accusations

144
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:49,663
Are unfounded absolutely will have none of it

145
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,527
Victorian so happy Winter Solstice Michaela

146
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,551
You're now

147
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111
Four Star

148
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,159
Get mad and tell your brother

149
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,951
Someone someone sodomites

150
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:08,607
Has a Caribbean

151
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,239
I don't want

152
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,031
Jesus Christ

153
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,335
Thank you very much

154
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,615
So we come

155
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,407
Into December to

156
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,687
2003

157
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,479
We are still in advance

158
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,527
Of Saddam being found

159
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,599
Again is what were what we're heading towards

160
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,391
In the in this

161
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,439
Chronology where we're heading towards that

162
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,719
Trying to see how Alex

163
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,487
React

164
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,047
Is coverage in the lead up to it as well

165
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:42,399
As we know he believes that Saddam is still alive which is accurate

166
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
True but

167
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,727
He believes that he has fled the country is in Belarus

168
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,567
With a bunch of stolen gold and his is Suntour

169
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:54,175
Actually that it's going to be weird to explain how Saddam went from Comfort

170
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,199
In Belarus

171
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:59,807
To the central Temple hole in the ground

172
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,367
It will be tough but Alex is up for the challenge I'm sure

173
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:07,999
Okay so we start here in a little bit of a different take on some geopolitical figure

174
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,535
2003

175
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,471
BoBoiBoy

176
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:21,311
This man 2003 Alex's very

177
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,847
Much a of Putin

178
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,127
Did the bombings

179
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,431
As they both like pretext

180
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,479
Got order to fight the Chechen

181
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:33,343
Death ain't so well that is completely different now

182
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:39,743
One thing I like about having consistent principles is that I haven't had to change my opinion on Putin ever not

183
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,047
One time have I thought well maybe nope

184
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,863
100% anti-putin from the

185
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:51,263
The jump I've had some misgivings about him

186
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:58,431
1003 I'm pretty sure I was I think I was 19 so there's no reason for me

187
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:04,831
You have gone on the record I know you're writing a little column Bailey

188
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,367
Pro Putin

189
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,391
It did not

190
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,951
So there's another story Alex

191
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,487
You know when we're in the past

192
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,047
What are the things that Alex does is

193
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,839
He has like the Roundup

194
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,607
The story

195
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:22,751
A man alota bulshit for about two-and-a-half hours and then the last segment of the show is him repeat

196
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:27,103
Eating those headlines around up in the food.

197
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:31,199
It's a secure some of the stories

198
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,247
Toronto

199
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,527
Start article

200
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,807
Girl

201
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:07,551
Husband quite a bit of time trying to track this story down but I was unable to find the actual news story that was covering this case

202
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:11,903
Turn off the GPS because there's a story that happened in Canada

203
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,231
Wherever you at Child Protective Service doesn't have any jurisdiction

204
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,767
Extradition

205
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:23,167
The Toronto Star article itself isn't online anymore in the way-back machine doesn't have a snapshot of it but cruising around I was able to

206
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,959
Find some other cases that Alex my won

207
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,727
I consider

208
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,495
And Leo

209
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:32,895
October 2003 a 23 year old mother in Summerville Georgia was arrested for throwing her eight-month-old into a dryer

210
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:39,551
Or in November 2011 in Niles Miss Michigan was arrested for shutting her six-year-old son in a

211
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,087
Running dryer

212
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,367
We're playing hide and seek

213
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,695
During which time he had hit in the dryer Jesus Christ

214
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:49,023
One of the things that I sadly learned while prepping this episode is that apparel

215
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,583
Only people put babies and dryers more than you'd think

216
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,607
Like which is horrible

217
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:57,983
Even if you grant that all the details of the story Alex is telling her true it's still not a valid point

218
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:01,823
There are definitely valid critiques of the CPS in foster care

219
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,943
To be made it anything that can be done to protect the children in that world is a moral imperative to pursue

220
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,991
But abuse like this happens in all this

221
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:09,759
My contacts

222
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:13,087
The image that Alex is trying to present is that it never happens

223
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:16,927
Between a parent and a child and whenever there's a headline that read like that's the case

224
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:20,255
It's secretly a situation where the CPS is abusing children

225
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,791
You're trying to blame it on parents

226
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,815
Because the globalist

227
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,583
A family

228
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:28,703
In hindsight it really shouldn't come as a huge surprise that Alex got caught up and s*** like pee

229
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,495
Pizzagate the Wayfair stuff

230
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:34,847
It pretty much every other child abuse satanic panic

231
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,919
He's never really taking the issue seriously

232
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,967
So what are you doing now is more or less

233
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,527
The natural progression of what you see even back in 2000

234
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:46,623
It's a cartoonish Miss around a fairly serious issue

235
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,903
Yeah

236
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,719
That is that is one of those

237
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,999
One of those things where I can

238
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,047
Definitely understand the

239
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:54,815
The desire to

240
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,119
To think that it only would be an evil organ

241
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,143
Innovation that could do the

242
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,423
You know like that

243
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,983
That is one of those things where you want to retreat

244
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,519
From the idea that a parent

245
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,543
No matter

246
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,103
What the circumstances could even do that

247
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:07,871
You know

248
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:12,479
I get that but also know that's not how it works right

249
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:18,111
That's that's one example of a few actually think that you're going to see on

250
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,903
This episode of

251
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,511
Places where conspiracy theories serve to make things feel more like you think

252
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:30,911
They should be an underappreciated Dynamic of some of the the narratives

253
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,447
That people put out.

254
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:38,591
Maybe this that doesn't make sense to me emotionally intuitively or whatever

255
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,359
Or even just

256
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,151
Hopefully

257
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:46,783
So Alex Reeb these headlines before even reads them

258
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,559
Prove it

259
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,607
Start reading some articles

260
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,615
Barbara Sturm article

261
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
Propaganda

262
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,599
This is such a perfect encapsulation of Alex

263
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,927
His methods except he's lying about following up by reading the story

264
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:30,815
He just needs a headline and decides he knows what the articles about them doesn't change his mind when presented with evidence

265
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,607
That is manufactured narrative is based

266
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,143
I think

267
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,191
I am in my mind what hap

268
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,215
Does that sound right

269
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,751
He reads a headline

270
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:45,663
And then starts thinking of what he wants it to be another out there it's reading the words all the sudden they swirled together in a man

271
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,967
Magic paper and then rearrange themselves

272
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,503
The way that he wants them

273
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,295
To go it's exactly happy

274
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:57,695
And his mom is exactly that except for the part where he's still looking at the words while they're rearranging

275
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:04,095
Imagine what the story is I got my God

276
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:08,703
Good father wait for the words to redo themselves you can just throw the paper in the garbage

277
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:13,055
Alex has some memories of Fire

278
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:19,199
Short and he's wrong

279
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,759
But he's a very wrong about his memories

280
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,743
Most

281
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,423
Marine

282
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,455
Accident

283
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,479
Started

284
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,047
Control

285
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:12,703
To the fall of 2003 was a horrific season for fires in California which would eventually come to include for

286
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,983
14 different fires

287
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,799
The Cedar Fire being remembered as the most

288
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,567
Severe of the bunch

289
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:22,687
The first one on October 21st was called the roblar to fire

290
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,015
And this one was accidentally started at the Marine Corps Base

291
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
Camp

292
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,319
On the firing range

293
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:33,439
This was particularly complicated fire response because it was on Federal Land

294
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,719
And beyond that just

295
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,999
Consider all the things that could have

296
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,279
Load at a Marine Base

297
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:42,399
I didn't get some sense of how delicately fireteams needed to tread

298
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,167
Pretty bad

299
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,959
Is shity is this sound

300
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,519
Fires at these bases

301
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,287
It's not a

302
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,567
Terribly uncommon

303
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,895
I was able to find examples of fires breaking out just

304
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,919
Camp Pendleton

305
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:57,247
In 2008 and 2014 and that was

306
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:03,135
Barely even putting any effort into looking

307
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:06,975
I arrive feel like I've witnessed a minor fires

308
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,279
Just existing in my own place

309
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,583
And there are far fewer flammable things about

310
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:18,239
You know like there's a lot of people in a large amount of flammable things true

311
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,799
Exactly

312
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:27,455
Too many of the other fires were smaller in nature but they contributed to an environment where firefighting resources were spread thin

313
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:31,807
Made worse by a dry season and the arrival of some bad Santa Ana winds

314
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,111
That made fire spread much more easily

315
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:37,183
The Cedar Fire which the San Diego government

316
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:41,279
Describe this quote the largest Wildland fire in California history

317
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,815
Was started quote when

318
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:46,143
Hunter became lost and little small fire to signal for help

319
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,447
One of the other large fires called

320
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,007
The old fire was started by an arsonist

321
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,543
First name Ricky Lee Fowler

322
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,103
Who burned the house down after he was kicked out of it

323
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,639
The fire ended up killing

324
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,919
5 people and in

325
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,991
2013 he was found guilty of those murders and sent

326
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:01,759
Dance to death

327
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:06,111
Another of the large fires was the Grand Prix fire which was suspicious

328
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:10,463
But was called an accident by investigators in 2004 likely the result

329
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,487
Oven exhaust

330
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,767
Spark or cigarette butt

331
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:19,935
I'm not sure what out evidence Alex is basing his claims on and he doesn't cite a single Source other than his Memories of Us

332
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,983
Name news things he claimed through

333
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,775
Still seems like maybe he's just talkin

334
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,663
If I had to guess I would say that he's taking the fact that the roblar to fire began at Camp Pendleton

335
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,967
And then pretending that some of these other fires like

336
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:35,039
The older Grand Prix also had military involvement

337
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,575
In their ignition

338
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,623
That seems in line with how his mind works

339
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:42,719
And how he processes information

340
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,791
Exactly was the nefarious Evil part that was

341
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:52,447
Like he's saying that all of these fires got started at military bases. Not all military bases but all

342
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,471
Military like

343
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,335
But I don't understand what their goals

344
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,127
Climate change

345
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,943
Something make people think it's worse or something I don't know

346
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,759
They could script Marines

347
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,807
To start random massive

348
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:14,207
Forest fires right in order to trick people into thinking the property values I don't know got to have that

349
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:20,607
Specific about what fire he's talking about in Arizona but I believe the one he's talking about the big one that pits

350
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:23,679
Around the time frame that he's mentioning is known as the Aspen fire

351
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:26,239
This Fire Burns for just short of a month

352
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:29,567
And ended up covering / 84000 acres of land

353
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,847
In the woods

354
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,895
Switch to fit Alex's decryption

355
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:36,223
Initially folks thought that it was possibly caused by a lightning

356
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:41,855
Strike but investigators fairly quickly ruled that out as none of the telltale signs were there

357
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:48,511
It's believed that it was human-caused and while the definite origin isn't known there was a man who ended up being charged with

358
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:53,887
Convicted of lying to investigators about whether or not he was smoking on the trail that day

359
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,703
Exactly where the fire was known to have started

360
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:00,543
It's a pretty safe assumption that this was the inciting incident that caused

361
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
The fire

362
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:05,407
Or I guess you could globulus military exercises involved setting up giant fires

363
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:09,503
How to prove that if he wants

364
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:15,135
In the interest of full disclosure the military does hold training exercises twice a year in that area

365
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,440
In a program called Angel Thunder

366
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:22,304
It's about Personnel recovery but it absolutely would not be taken

367
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,864
Place near the trail where the fire started

368
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,912
Yeah and the program began in 2000

369
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:32,032
But there is that is a bass right nearby this

370
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:35,872
Mount Lemmon the area where the the fire was

371
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:40,992
It's conceivable that there might have been some sort of an exercise that pre-existed

372
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,272
Angel Thunder

373
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,576
Even so

374
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,880
Investigators are able to zero in on a

375
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:51,232
Pretty close location of where the fire started

376
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:55,072
Anywhere near where people were doing exercise

377
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,448
Prove this

378
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,984
Man you know what that

379
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,288
When you hear that Firebird for a month

380
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:10,944
You know it's 8 so f****** crazy to complete mastery

381
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:17,344
Cover fire can turn the fire on now if I got a lighter in my pocket bike master

382
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,624
And then you said that

383
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,904
Gets out of control a little bit

384
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,440
And it's burning for a month

385
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,208
Yeah

386
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,744
F****** crazy

387
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,096
Damn an issue here is that these kinds of giant devastating event

388
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:32,448
Can be easily caused by mundane and seemingly inconsequential things

389
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,472
And it doesn't feel right

390
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,336
It's an everyday action for so many people to just toss their cigarette butts on the ground so yeah

391
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,384
Seem possible that doing that could lead to

392
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,432
The tens of thousands of Acres being burned

393
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,968
And hundreds of homes being

394
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,736
Destroy

395
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,504
Not fair

396
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,648
But it can't happen but it's not fair and I knew about

397
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:55,744
Doesn't feel right that something so insignificant could have such severe effect

398
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,096
Can have the result of causing people to seek for explanations that do feel right

399
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:06,496
Something as huge as a month-long fire requires a commensurate cause like a shadowy world government plot

400
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,288
It's debatable whether Alex

401
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:13,664
Is a person who suffers from this need to come up with emotionally satisfying stories to explain world events

402
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,712
Or if he knows that the audience

403
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,504
Does any exploit that the profit

404
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,272
Spectrum down

405
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,064
I'm not sure but either way it

406
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,600
It's really best not to take information

407
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,880
Inform him

408
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,416
Yeah yeah

409
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:25,952
Band

410
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:29,792
Avel boy of all the of all the cockamamie screw-ups

411
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:34,144
Deborah ball boy being responsible for a forest fire

412
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,168
Yeah I mean

413
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:39,264
Cedar Fire 12 is really a bummer because

414
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,288
You going to

415
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,616
Subway's if you're a hunter and you're lost

416
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:50,016
And like you have a potential that you might die out in the woods or something right

417
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:53,344
Where's our something that survivalists or talk to

418
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:57,696
It's not outside of the realm of like well what else am I supposed to do in this

419
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,464
Situation

420
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,512
Mnd side effect of it

421
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,792
You know is this

422
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,328
Hundreds of

423
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,632
Dozens of Acres end up burned

424
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,424
Complete disaster

425
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:13,312
Yeah I know it puts all of the reality survival contest shows that I've ever seen in such a weird like

426
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:19,712
Whatever you stop and think about it like oh we're f****** up a section of the Earth for my entertainment

427
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,528
You know it messes with your head but the idea that it's

428
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,832
Entirely possible that one of those shows

429
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:30,208
Obviously it hasn't happened but in the future if we don't we don't know baby cuz

430
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:34,048
That would be the globalist for sure get it for 3

431
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:41,216
Yeah I mean like you're even on Survivor like there has been times when the like the shelter

432
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,264
Has burned down but like it does

433
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,056
Spread further

434
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,872
Yeah it's

435
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:48,896
It's

436
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:52,736
You know I mean I don't know how else to say but life is very fragile

437
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:57,600
It is it is

438
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:04,000
Planet this season in 2003 so fascinating because you have this like this Cedar Fire

439
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,816
Fire that is caused by this

440
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:07,840
Guy

441
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,912
Who's signaling for help

442
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:17,312
This guy did nothing wrong there late maybe didn't make the fire as well as he could have maybe there's something

443
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,616
It could have been anything

444
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:23,200
You wouldn't assign moral culpability to him

445
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:23,968
For that

446
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,528
I've been simultaneously there's this old fire

447
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,064
There is an arsonist

448
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,344
Who said it

449
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,136
Moral culpability

450
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:34,464
Yeah you have these burning within the same season

451
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,864
And it's easy to get all of them in your head as the same fire because I are all looks the same

452
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,400
It's hot and there's smoke

453
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,728
2003 was the the year

454
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:48,800
A fire moral relativism

455
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,824
Explain

456
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,944
It took a while preparing this episode because I had those sorts of thoughts

457
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:59,552
A little bit and then because of this

458
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,344
Story which blew my mind

459
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,160
Just look at the types of articles I have

460
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,792
Blurb

461
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,320
I guess you shouldn't

462
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:38,720
I don't know why you're welcome not you

463
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,608
Wild It Out by that a really should be headlines

464
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:47,168
Starting conflicts

465
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:53,568
At the beginning of the second Mexican-American war so this is a wild Newsmax story where a guy named Robert mop

466
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,456
Claimed that he and his family have been kidnapped by as many as eight Mexican soldiers who would cross the border to

467
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,224
To capture him

468
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:05,600
Mysteriously they were let go and this wasn't an international incident that was sparked over it

469
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:12,000
Crossing over borders to detain people even when they're wanted fugitives is a messy business as Dog The Bounty

470
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,024
Hunter learn first

471
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:17,120
The team's wild to imagine that this story happened as mopping describe

472
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:20,192
He claims that he reported a meth lab

473
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:23,776
Habitue on his land to the DEA who then told the Mexican authorities

474
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:27,616
Sure I'm clear why they would do this considering that his land is in the United States

475
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,176
It's but let's not get lost them

476
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:33,248
Good call the Newsmax headline ends with a?

477
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,296
Because even they aren't sure about this

478
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,088
A sourcing is sin

479
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:43,488
What whose quote was it that if it ends in a? The answers no I don't know any news articles

480
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,840
And if the news might even a little bit of leg work

481
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:50,400
They would not have had a good cause

482
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,168
To publish

483
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:55,520
The story

484
00:27:56,032 --> 00:28:02,176
For safety by xenophobic demagogues like Alex when they were bored

485
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:02,944
Story

486
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,992
Yats us poking around

487
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:10,880
I came across an article in the New York Times I get arrested for the past

488
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,648
Sprite

489
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,208
Here we go

490
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:21,632
It's like I don't want it's going to be before I say

491
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,680
There was an article in the times

492
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,984
From May 1997

493
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,032
Put includes this little tidbit

494
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:28,800
Quote

495
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:34,176
Bob Maupin who maintains that he was arrested on his own land by Mexican soldiers protecting a meth lab

496
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:37,760
Smugglers have tried to run him down and their trucks

497
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,088
497

498
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:47,744
That article also explains how it started his own vigilante group that wanders the border and make citizen's arrest

499
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:53,120
Blessing of the deputy sheriff Robert Novak

500
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,824
Dressed in camouflage

501
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,968
Fatigues that carry semi-automatic rifles their own vietnam-era seismic sensors and zip ties for handcuffs

502
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:11,552
Quote we get together at night to make a game out of it hookah

503
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,320
Can catch the most

504
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,088
Besides

505
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:17,952
If you dress properly they don't know who you are so we get really really good cooperation

506
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,512
Right yeah those guys should be in jail

507
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:24,608
Of all the people who should be in jail in this story it is those dudes

508
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,632
Snap

509
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:29,728
This guy created a militia that terrorizes immigrants were fun

510
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:34,080
More than one occasion that he's been kidnapped by Mexican soldiers crossing the border because he's

511
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,360
Ditched on a meth lab

512
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:38,688
Seems like that story isn't true and maybe it's a rationalization

513
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,736
Hawaii mop and does this horrible s***

514
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,272
So you don't have to feel like a monster

515
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:48,416
2016 Maupin was interviewed about his support for Trump's wall in the Monterey Herald

516
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:51,744
Multiple times being held captive by the

517
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,512
Government

518
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:58,400
Weirdly neither does his creation of a vigilante gang

519
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:04,800
Very important to note that he isn't shy about letting Mexican Viagra

520
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:10,176
Smuggler's know that they aren't welcome to pass through his sprawling property in the Tiny Town of Boulevard

521
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:14,528
If you can read this you're in range one sign says his breath

522
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:17,344
Here's one thing that I have

523
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,952
An interested when you're reporting on this type of thing

524
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:25,792
Sure you can say it's a vigilante group or gang

525
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:29,376
Or you could say it's a group of men who commit hate

526
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:34,496
Crimes on the regular same thing so maybe one weighs more accurate though

527
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:36,800
Then

528
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:37,568
There's a book

529
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,360
Call illegals

530
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:43,200
The image of right by our unsecured us Mexico border

531
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:48,576
This book retails a time when mopping was kidnapped by Mexican troops

532
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:55,232
I love I love his stick into his fictional story I like it this time it was along with his daughter

533
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:59,840
85

534
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:05,472
Apparently he told a friend of his who worked in Narcotics enforcement that he smelled ether on his property

535
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:11,616
And there was a building about half a mile from the border that was usually empty but he would periodically see it occupied

536
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:15,712
He would know was occupied because plainclothes men with weapons would be patrolling

537
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:18,272
Then they would Hoist the Mexican flag

538
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:24,416
Nothing meth labs on foreign soil like to do more than announce their presence in Toronto tension to themselves

539
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,976
Rihanna's daughter were out shooting and work

540
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:29,536
Confronted by Mexican troops carrying NATO weapon

541
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:32,352
It should be noted that this situation is about

542
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:38,752
The same setup as the story being told in 2003 where his whole family was out shooting

543
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:43,104
Stuff these groups that they were looking for illegal guns and drugs

544
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,384
Today I have no

545
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,456
Jurisdiction to investigate of us oil to this is ridiculous

546
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:50,272
They also said they were looking for senior Maupin

547
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:56,672
Which Robert said quote made it pretty clear to me that that I had made somebody in the Mexican Government angry by sticking my nose

548
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,696
Who's into their drug business

549
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:02,048
I would say regularly committing hate crimes probably makes a lot of people mad at you

550
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,584
He warned the truth

551
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,656
But their guns work legal here whereas his

552
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,424
Is were

553
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:14,080
What are the soldiers didn't care and tried to take his daughters Gunn fuckbay so she backhanded him

554
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:14,848
About noctem

555
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,872
Oh my God

556
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:20,992
The others ready their weapons so mopping and his daughter put down their guns knowing that they were outmatched

557
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:24,320
This story is a convoluted mess and I don't believe a word of it

558
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,856
This part is

559
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,880
Particularly unbelief

560
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,184
Robert Maupin was

561
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,560
Planning to pursue legal remedies but Federal officials told him he would have to be in court for 3 to 4 months

562
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:39,424
Straight time he decided to let the matter drop

563
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,704
You know what sure

564
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,776
The entire Mexican government

565
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:46,080
Send a small Cadre of troops

566
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,384
Apparently kidnap you

567
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,456
Three or four months in court

568
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:59,136
Instead of spending those months and God I guess mop and decided to recycle this story on a couple more occasions to justifies discuss

569
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:04,256
Gothic vigilante actions in the process create new cycles that incite fear and hatred of Mexican Emma

570
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:08,608
Anyway this is part of the story that Alex doesn't cover because he does

571
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:15,264
He just looks for headlines that helped him get involved in that same incitement to fear and hatred and it does the job

572
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,288
He ignores

573
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,312
Is the?

574
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,336
And ignores

575
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:21,920
Hey who is this guy what's going on oh he's told this story

576
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,200
Multiple time

577
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:23,968
He seems to

578
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,248
Keep getting kidnapped

579
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:31,648
Gilligan's Island they end up

580
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:35,488
He keeps getting kidnapped I will say this

581
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:40,096
Never before has a story made me more likely to believe that Steve pieczenik

582
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,120
Is Jack Ryan

583
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,400
Okay sure

584
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,424
This is the one

585
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:46,496
Each time he's telling me stories

586
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:53,152
He doesn't say not again

587
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:56,224
In the present tense

588
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,856
And it's a new instant damage on boys

589
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,672
The government is going to kidnap us again

590
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:07,232
Ridiculous

591
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,024
Is absurd so

592
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,816
Anyway Alex

593
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:13,888
Is aee sold on this story for sure

594
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,472
He doesn't cover it too much because what is there to cover past the headline

595
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:24,896
Evan just being like why isn't everybody talking

596
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:28,224
About this true

597
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,760
Yes I agree

598
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,808
Why are people talking about that

599
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:34,112
Infant worrying anyway true I would

600
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,928
I would suggest that there's a decent chance that

601
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,208
Like

602
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,744
He wouldn't have a choice

603
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:46,400
About whether or not he went to court with it I feel like the US government would take it to court

604
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:52,800
Testify under subpoena making him more likely to be jailed by the United States government then

605
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,336
The Mexican government

606
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,616
Yeah it's

607
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:57,920
I mean

608
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:00,224
You can't you can't detain

609
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:06,368
Foreign Nationals on foreign soil even if your bestest

610
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,136
Buds

611
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,952
Margarita's countries like there's still no

612
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,744
Even if Canada

613
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,376
Accidentally at the f****** Niagara Falls just grabbed the guy and pulled them across the border

614
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:22,752
It would be an international incident would have to have the permission of the other government

615
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,032
So

616
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,824
Alex talks a little bit about drills

617
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,616
Interesting

618
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,640
Take On Me

619
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:29,664
Because

620
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,944
This is a knot

621
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,248
He

622
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,272
Behaves in the

623
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:44,768
High School

624
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,864
The arms blown off

625
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,936
Hydrometer

626
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,728
Did not have those kind of things.

627
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,368
Shotgun

628
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:17,536
Throwing

629
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,816
Cars

630
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:27,520
Why

631
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,016
Bottom

632
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,064
What's a drill

633
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,832
What's your reading

634
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,136
Rush

635
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:53,888
Terrorist attack

636
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:59,264
This definitely isn't the reason with Alex says that they are training in scenario exercises now

637
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,032
This is

638
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:00,800
Completely

639
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:03,360
Ring conspiracy narrative that he's expressing in the past

640
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:10,272
A misconception he thinks that they're all these exercises because your unconscious mind will experience them as if they're real Attack

641
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:13,344
And you'll emotionally think that there are more attacks in Iraq

642
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,112
Actually are

643
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:19,488
Because of your heightened state of subconscious fear the globalist will be able to exploit you into supporting things

644
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,024
That are sold to you in the name

645
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,792
How protective

646
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:22,816
You from these attacks

647
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:28,448
Of course in more prison times these exercises exist to give cover to real false flag attack

648
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:31,008
For instance the operation lockstep

649
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,056
S*** existed so that the globalist

650
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,848
Could plan the covid-19 release

651
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:37,408
And if anyone was caught they could say was part of the ex

652
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,176
Exercise

653
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:40,480
Leaving aside how stupid that theory is

654
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:44,832
It's the it's worlds apart from this 2003 understanding of these exercises

655
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:49,696
And that's because at this point 2003 Alex doesn't seem to have recognized the value of

656
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:53,280
Fully denying reality and calling everything false flag

657
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:59,424
His business model is still kind of in its infancy and hasn't matured to this present a level that we see now where it's like

658
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,192
F*** it

659
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:00,960
Everything

660
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:04,032
Maturity or metastasized

661
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:09,664
Also if Alex thinks he's exercises exist to give people a subconscious sense that things are worse than they are

662
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,224
I would suggest he consider how he covers move

663
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,016
I am how the lies an exaggeration

664
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,808
Give his audio

665
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,600
The impression that things are worse than they are

666
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:23,744
Specifically around certain themes like immigration and white identity fears I don't understand what you're saying

667
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,536
Are you saying that he is

668
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:31,936
It like whenever he says the government is trying to subconsciously make people more afraid of terrorism by creator

669
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:35,008
Are you saying that he is been taking something like

670
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,312
The story of an absolute lunatic

671
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:43,712
And then bolstering it with his bullshiting to make it look like everybody is in

672
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,736
Being invaded by the

673
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
Country

674
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,040
More less

675
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:51,648
And also like I wasn't able to find this article that he was talking about but like

676
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,952
I bet that article is just

677
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:54,976
Somebody

678
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,512
Add a newspaper

679
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,304
Having a little bit of a flourish

680
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,328
You know it

681
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,144
I read those articles are like

682
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,544
Bombs are exploding everywhere paragraph It's like and it was all

683
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,616
An exercise to train people for the Bible.

684
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:15,456
Do you write as if it's real at the lead in the beginning

685
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:17,504
It's kind of fun

686
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,528
The conception that

687
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,064
Most of your readers

688
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,368
Will know already

689
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:27,232
From the word go that bombs were not actually going off in their own town

690
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:30,304
Alex is a little bit

691
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,120
Maybe a little bit over exaggerating

692
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,912
So apparently Columbine

693
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,472
Call swag baby

694
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,032
The Secret Service

695
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,416
Call parents

696
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,464
Secret

697
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,488
Underground

698
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,072
Mechanic

699
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,008
Principal

700
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:12,544
Text

701
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:17,920
Can you

702
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,344
And

703
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,504
It was a military

704
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:04,000
What Alex has Express in with his girl talk appears to go like the

705
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:07,840
A training drill happens which no one is claiming is a real event

706
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:13,984
Alex pretends the people are saying it is a real event that takes on the role of the guy insisting these are fake Grillz

707
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:19,616
Eventually a news outlet covers the drill and Alex takes that as an admission

708
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:22,176
And that he's yelling force them to end their cover-up

709
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,248
His role in the whole thing is a charade and entirely me

710
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:30,880
Unfortunately this is exactly the kind of thinking that left unexamined for too long

711
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,928
It enabled by a further radicalized

712
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:33,952
Conspiracy environment

713
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,512
Leads to a person losing a billion dollars

714
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,656
All that stuff about Columbine does sound remarkably similar to the cephalic says about Sandy Hook

715
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:49,056
Not necessarily in terms of the specifics of the claim but the way that there's a collection of claims that he

716
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,336
He almost certainly got from

717
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:54,943
Wheatley disreputable sources which aren't accurate but he throws out anyway to

718
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:57,759
Defend his contention that it was a big theatrical event

719
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,831
It's the same way that he has all of these talking points

720
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,599
Benny Blanco

721
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:04,927
What kids are walking around the school's the porta potties

722
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:07,231
You know they don't let paramedics

723
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:09,791
These things that's exactly what you heard with

724
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:12,863
His his description of Columbine

725
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:17,471
It's definitely seasonal to live

726
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:20,031
We're literally talking to the ghost of his Christmas

727
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,055
Just passed as we speak

728
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,407
Yeah it's a little bit on the nose

729
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,431
The current Circle

730
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,199
Thermostats is

731
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,759
Of our situation

732
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,039
Costa Chris

733
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,831
Also important

734
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:35,903
Harrison Klebold were not in the trenchcoat Mafia

735
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:41,535
That existed at the school who were wrongly associated with the shooting because the shooters War dust

736
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:48,447
Most of the people in that actual crew had graduated the year prior but in the Panic of the immediate aftermath I still got them confused

737
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:53,055
In the media did a poor job of covering this leading to misconceptions at linger to this day

738
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:56,383
Much like the narrative in Harrison Klebold were bullied which also

739
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,663
It's not

740
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,479
Full accurate description of

741
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:01,759
What led to the

742
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:09,439
So anyway Alex's wrong about another school shooting

743
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:15,839
Right as rain is always wrong downfall was cemented

744
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:18,399
How many years ago it was written

745
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,423
In stone

746
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,703
So fast

747
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,287
This is not saying

748
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:30,431
Necessarily in any way that like the shooting was faked right or that no one died or anything like that

749
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:33,759
But you already see the seed of it's going to

750
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:38,367
Grow into his presentation year and that's like

751
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:43,487
It almost gives a yeah there's a feeling of inevitability but

752
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:49,887
You know when you when you start looking at things from a Delia logical perspective and then you see

753
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,911
I mean it and eggs

754
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:51,679
Exact

755
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:54,495
Like nucleus of the future

756
00:43:55,007 --> 00:44:01,151
Ath fascinating to think of you wouldn't know that this is the kind of place I could go to back then but looking back

757
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:07,551
It seemed so obvious like it's John Lennon walking by guitar store like

758
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:08,575
Kind of

759
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:10,367
If that kind of feeling of life

760
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:12,671
That's what I'm going to be

761
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,975
So there's a drill in Austin

762
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:16,767
And Alex

763
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,351
Cuz hell

764
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,119
So he blocked

765
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:21,887
The news

766
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:22,911
Right I get there

767
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:23,935
This is amazing

768
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:38,527
Haircut

769
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:46,975
Drill

770
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:09,247
Turned out

771
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:15,903
War

772
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,383
So you got scooped on your lie

773
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,735
So Alex

774
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,783
I mean I think there's a couple things leak

775
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:43,807
To pull out of there

776
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,647
The first is that he lies about sources

777
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,183
How do you

778
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:53,023
When you admit that the first time I can ever trust you again

779
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:55,327
Right now you might be bluffing

780
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:59,167
In the telling of this story whether it's true or not

781
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:03,007
The he got the outcome that he wanted right

782
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:03,775
EXO

783
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,543
Lying work

784
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:10,943
So why would you stop lying at any given point seems like as an incentive to live based on his own story

785
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,223
And

786
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,015
This

787
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,551
Is it again this

788
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,343
Is all existing his head

789
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:22,463
This feels like when the Boston bombing happened

790
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:24,767
And he feels like the media is talking

791
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,535
King to him

792
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,583
Yeah I have those like

793
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:30,655
They had to get out ahead of me Friday saying this

794
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:33,471
As I know there was a drill

795
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:35,007
That you were yelling about

796
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:41,407
And the News will probably going to have a story about Heather was a drill to drill them about source

797
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:43,967
And what have you and it meant nothing

798
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:44,735
They were like

799
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:47,807
I don't know what to do with this point phone call right click

800
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:50,623
Cool

801
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,391
I mean

802
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,415
This isn't like

803
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,463
The perfect state of Al

804
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:56,255
Being annoying

805
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,559
But ultimately

806
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:01,631
He has no impacted anyting is what he

807
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,679
He should be there is no

808
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,215
Nothing needs changing

809
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:09,055
Look in terms of these drills and stuff that like

810
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,335
They're they're happening

811
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,615
People are learning

812
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,663
How to respond to stuff

813
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:16,735
What do you want do you want people that have two

814
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:21,087
To deal with it for the very first time time it happened snow

815
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:27,487
God will provide

816
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:33,887
God didn't wanted to massive nuclear spill you don't want have somebody being like

817
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:34,655
Hey sorry man

818
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:40,799
This is my first nuclear spill cuz that's a reasonable excuse for why we're all dead

819
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,335
Here's the other thing too

820
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,359
If you believe

821
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:46,431
Leave like what Alex is saying then there are these like

822
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,199
Hundred

823
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,223
Of

824
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:48,991
Make event

825
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:51,295
Right yeah

826
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,831
He's got to be like

827
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,415
Jumping from room to room he's going to be like spinning

828
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:59,487
Plates to Tryon like cover all of this stuff

829
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:03,583
It's like get to the get to all of these fake events cuz if you didn't

830
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:07,423
What was to be allowed to pass them off as real I have a bigger Quest

831
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,191
Yeah

832
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:12,031
What is the ratio of fake events to real events

833
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,311
Are there more

834
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:18,431
Fake of athenry

835
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,479
What is into fake event

836
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:23,551
You never want to be specific.

837
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,575
Cuz I feel like it

838
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:28,159
If the ratio is the opposite then the real events are The Fixx

839
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:30,719
Terms of

840
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:31,999
Do you know

841
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,791
A giant

842
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:34,559
Events

843
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:37,119
Mass casualty type events

844
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,143
I would imagine

845
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:40,959
You know if you want to use this language

846
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:42,239
There are more fake event

847
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,007
NetSpend real one

848
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:49,663
Inasmuch as there are training exercises that happen right and a lot of EMTs and

849
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,199
Emergency medical

850
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,479
Stop along with

851
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,271
Military

852
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:58,879
Training type stuff probably happen more

853
00:48:59,135 --> 00:48:59,647
Then

854
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,671
Newsworthy

855
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,719
Here's the thing

856
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:04,511
Malik season

857
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:07,327
Covering all of these drills that happen

858
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,119
Can't. Even close not even

859
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,911
There's too many and guess what

860
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,703
He doesn't cover

861
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:15,519
Aren't reported in the news as real

862
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:21,407
Cuz otherwise we would be having like oh my God new cleared there's a lot of other everything I ever you all over

863
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:24,735
Happening on almost like a calendar

864
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:32,671
As if there was a regular training exercise in case this sort of thing were to happen

865
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:37,791
Seems to be happening biannually in the exact same place

866
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:43,423
The show I listen to the tells me about this is not serialized otherwise that would be an issue

867
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,959
Very dumb

868
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:49,823
So Alex talks about to the the Texas Family story again the back getting

869
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,359
Any takes it up a notch

870
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,735
Because the family

871
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:06,975
Border in

872
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:15,423
North Carolina

873
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:29,247
Get off your property

874
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:35,903
Machine gun points

875
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:36,671
Okay

876
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:38,207
That's that's fun

877
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:41,279
That's fun I think it would be more fun

878
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:47,679
I think we would have all have a more fun life if some people were just British troops with machine guns

879
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:52,543
Get off the Lions

880
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:57,151
Whimsical evil what happened to America happen with the land

881
00:50:57,407 --> 00:51:01,759
Did he have to leave

882
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:03,295
For the queen now

883
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:15,839
He's got the

884
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:17,887
Obviously

885
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:23,007
But it's probably based on a fraudulent telling of a real fact

886
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,311
That there is a tiny piece of land

887
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:30,943
Approximately .052 acres in North Carolina that is actually British soil

888
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:34,783
Intersect there is a small patch of land on Ocracoke Island

889
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:35,807
Memorial to

890
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:38,367
The five British soldiers who died there in World War

891
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:41,951
The land is technically still it in the US but it's

892
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:44,767
Permanently lease to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission

893
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:47,071
So it might as well be British and it's kind of

894
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:51,423
Considered British land within the continental US

895
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:57,823
That so there is that they think that's about as close as you're going to get I imagine Alex heard that it was like

896
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:04,479
The British are taking land in North Carolina I love it I love it you see the connective tissue

897
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:07,807
Could possibly be to a guy getting kicked out of his deer stand

898
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:13,439
By British troops hundred percent total

899
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:16,767
I mean you're literally a hunting on a burial ground

900
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:18,815
So yeah you're kind of an a****** here

901
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:19,839
No no no

902
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:22,911
Who was actually have no

903
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:26,239
No that's a little disappointed the story

904
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:29,055
At its core his grave

905
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,335
Okay

906
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:32,895
Okay okay I'm headed to British soil within the United

907
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,687
And it has to do with the military

908
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,735
I'm saying that Alex

909
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:40,063
Was made aware of that and then he wrote a story in his head

910
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,903
Facts about a North Carolina man giving a costume to buy

911
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:44,927
British troops

912
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,463
Hit machine gun point

913
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:52,095
Going to get off the land type of story that Alex would makeup up immediately

914
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:53,375
The British have some land

915
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:59,775
Clearly a hunter with kidnap there

916
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:02,847
The embellishment cycle

917
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:05,663
Call Joseph Watson is in

918
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:06,687
I'll say

919
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:07,967
Watson

920
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:09,503
Being on the phone

921
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:11,807
And just coming in for a little bit

922
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,343
About where you belong

923
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,647
He's not a host

924
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:16,927
But he can come in

925
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:20,767
A like a little sting or whatever and he's not to not the worst

926
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:25,119
For some reason it sounds better when he's on the phone

927
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:25,887
Because it's like

928
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:32,287
We got our guy embedded in the UK

929
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:36,895
Fortunately the two of them were talking about the story about the Texas family that kidnapped

930
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,175
I am Alex

931
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,967
Is Out For Blood

932
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:50,463
Ignored for a week and a half

933
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:53,023
Well it depends obviously

934
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:54,047
Ali said that

935
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,095
I'm should be a

936
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,375
Mainstream headlines

937
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,191
Carrie

938
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:01,983
Open policy

939
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,007
Refusing to all

940
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:03,775
Tambien

941
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:04,543
Beauregard's

942
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:05,823
Down there even though they got in

943
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:07,615
Every week by the Mack

944
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:22,207
Bordered by Constitution

945
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:26,815
We're not going to war with Mexico

946
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:33,215
Well that I kind of believe

947
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:35,007
Mexico is in my blood

948
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:38,847
Trust

949
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:41,407
If that was his reasoning I would have to

950
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,687
To say you know what at least

951
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:43,967
That's maybe on

952
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:47,551
Instead of all this old Mexicans are evil that's

953
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:53,951
Bulshit based on mythological racism you hate Mexico because your ancestors died

954
00:54:54,207 --> 00:55:00,351
Kalamata or whatever yeah you're spiritually connected to Colonel Travis whatever the f***

955
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,631
You just hate Mexico

956
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:04,191
I honestly also think

957
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:04,959
Think that if

958
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:07,775
This was the way he acted more

959
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,567
AAA would be more

960
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:10,847
Like

961
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:11,615
This

962
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:15,967
Is this kind of feels more like a sincere expression of his feelings like

963
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:21,599
I just hate Mexico I want to crush that country and also again

964
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:22,879
That's the

965
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:24,927
It seems like the stakes are raised but be

966
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:31,071
Because their race so ridiculously high no one's going to war with Mexico and this is a fake bulshit story

967
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,607
Pixar once again

968
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:37,471
Back down 20 self up into a frenzy where you want

969
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:43,871
War against a neighboring save over a very dubious article in New

970
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,663
Newsmax

971
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:48,223
Describe the headline ends with a?

972
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:54,367
That's more worthy than Alex's like in the same breath being like

973
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:57,183
They lied to get us into Iraq

974
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:01,279
A viking makeups

975
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:03,327
Youcam makeup

976
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:05,119
Let's go to war with next

977
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:07,423
Stylistics some calls

978
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:09,471
And this guy sucks

979
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,031
Gun Shop

980
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:12,799
One more thing

981
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:14,335
Collar White

982
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,103
Male right here with

983
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:20,479
Articles

984
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:23,807
It's an alarming

985
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:24,575
Virus

986
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:26,111
Use the word virus

987
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:28,671
Article

988
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:29,951
A white male

989
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:31,487
Hi Arabic

990
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,023
It seems like

991
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:35,839
Daughter

992
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,119
The white male

993
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:38,911
The -4

994
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:39,679
In a world

995
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:43,775
So they can have

996
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,343
The Catholic again

997
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:04,767
Open Redbox

998
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:08,095
And not inconsiderable amount of Alex's audio

999
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:09,631
Has always been this guy

1000
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:12,703
Anti-semitic white identity obsessed and paranoid

1001
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:16,543
I think it was straight something important to note

1002
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:22,431
On the part where white people and Arabs are being pitted against each other to say that the global

1003
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:24,479
Spit all groups against each other

1004
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:29,855
Doesn't really push back at all on the guys claim that there's a judeo new world order

1005
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:31,903
That's probably somewhat strategic

1006
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:34,719
The way he pushes back on some things and then leaves

1007
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:36,767
Other things going to like

1008
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,303
Yeah that is

1009
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,351
That is a way of introducing yourself

1010
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:47,775
Blue Collar white male here is the way of a Jedi go away

1011
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:52,383
I saw an ad that said blue collar white man need not apply

1012
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:59,039
I mean if you say it like that man so it's article that he's talking about was in The Help

1013
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:01,599
That is odd

1014
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:02,879
Ha it is odd

1015
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:07,231
So Alex gets into a stretch here where there's some really bad predictions

1016
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:08,255
City makes

1017
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:30,015
Hit across the

1018
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:37,183
Hot water

1019
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,303
Politician armed

1020
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,055
Father's Day

1021
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:06,367
Aspirated

1022
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:11,487
O'Brien

1023
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,975
Paul Watson Thomas

1024
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:46,303
Comments on my phone

1025
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:50,399
This is just Alex talking to himself

1026
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:54,495
I would die for anything that I feel like what are your comments on that

1027
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:55,519
What are your thoughts on there

1028
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:59,871
How courageous do you think I am I super crazy

1029
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:02,687
Or the most courageous there ever was your thoughts on that

1030
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:07,039
You're looking Rough and Ready I'm just thinking of a British thing

1031
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:13,183
Yeah I was just talking himself up there and it's kind of fun

1032
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:14,463
Vets

1033
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:16,767
He believes that the globalists are definitely going

1034
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:20,095
Like to kill him maybe in five years maybe tomorrow who knows

1035
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:23,679
And now almost 20 years later we sit here and

1036
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:25,215
He was not killed

1037
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:29,055
In fact he made millions and millions of dollars by getting worse

1038
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:29,823
And worse

1039
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:30,591
Yep

1040
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:34,431
Foolproof that if you die in your dreams you do not die in real life

1041
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:38,271
This is this is just

1042
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,807
Sad face

1043
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:43,391
I think I think that there is probably a small part of Alex

1044
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:45,951
Now in the present that he said he didn't die

1045
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,487
At some point

1046
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:51,071
Because this idea of the like what lives on is a man's Deeds

1047
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:54,655
Like there is a time when he could have probably

1048
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:56,703
I have a Bill Cooper ask eggs

1049
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:58,495
Where people like

1050
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:01,823
Deify Bill Cooper exit but it's

1051
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:06,431
Bill Cooper didn't end up living long enough to have like a

1052
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:07,711
Sweet

1053
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:08,479
Like

1054
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:09,247
Falling

1055
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,271
From

1056
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:14,111
Grace is even a billion dollars

1057
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:18,975
The key didn't have to become like this weirdo public drunk

1058
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:21,279
Shows up on these strange podcast

1059
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:23,327
8011 South

1060
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:29,727
Where's that Tyson interview

1061
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:35,615
She's not due come out there are a lot of things

1062
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:38,687
I think I think like

1063
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:40,479
In in Subway

1064
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:43,295
Is Alex Emily talked about this even like hundreds of episodes

1065
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:48,159
There is a certain sense that Alex has outlived his usefulness in

1066
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:53,535
Terms of the conspiracy community and he continues on as this weird thing

1067
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:58,911
That the next-generation is trying to navigate how they use these almost vestigial

1068
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:00,447
Depend

1069
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:02,751
It's like they need to exit we all need

1070
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,799
Exercising from the the human

1071
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:05,567
The humanity

1072
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:09,663
Yeah he is in Subway's but they're still like something to be gained

1073
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:10,687
From him and terms

1074
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:12,223
Exposure

1075
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:12,991
Stuff

1076
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:14,527
It's just yeah

1077
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:17,343
It's strange it's not a position I think anybody would want to be

1078
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:18,367
No

1079
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:20,671
No no I'm not I'm not expressing pity

1080
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:24,255
Probably

1081
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:27,583
Isn't where he wants to do

1082
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:28,607
If that's such the

1083
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:29,631
Greed

1084
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:30,655
Houck

1085
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:31,423
Can you want

1086
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:34,239
I can't imagine making

1087
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:36,799
A hundred million dollars in like a business

1088
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:38,079
And not being like

1089
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:38,847
Sweet

1090
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,127
Guess what that mean

1091
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,151
Games for me

1092
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:41,919
Out

1093
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:42,687
About

1094
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:46,271
You know I'm just I'm done with this stuff you do you somebody else

1095
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:47,551
And deal with all that b*******

1096
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:53,951
What if you had a underlying needs to demonize people and satisfy your anger

1097
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:56,767
Publicly and lash out to see that's the problem

1098
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:57,535
Yeah

1099
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:58,303
I wouldn't do

1100
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:00,607
You know another thing I was thinking about suicide

1101
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:04,191
This is

1102
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,727
Articulate exactly but

1103
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:10,335
So much of Alex's career involves this idea that like

1104
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:15,455
Todd like Fox News was going to give me millions of dollars as got you know like

1105
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:19,551
I couldn't be the thing that I want to be there right

1106
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:20,831
And now Tucker

1107
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:23,647
Carlson is the most important person in the world

1108
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:24,927
Kind of

1109
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:27,999
Contradicting Alex's entire ethos

1110
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:28,767
Right

1111
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:29,791
Like he could have

1112
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:32,351
Have conceivably gone to Fox News and Ben

1113
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:34,911
Richarlison

1114
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:40,287
General I mean well I mean Alex couldn't have because he doesn't have the

1115
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:42,335
Control necessary to do

1116
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:47,199
Somebody working within Fox News could have had the show that Alex

1117
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:49,247
Fixie wants to have

1118
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:51,807
The it there's there is a place with indians

1119
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,599
Do something can be corrupted enough

1120
01:03:54,623 --> 01:04:00,767
It's completely counter to his his ideas

1121
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:02,559
He couldn't do it it's not it's a

1122
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:04,607
Personal thing for him and

1123
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:09,727
And it's maybe because of him he's unemployable because of him maybe that

1124
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:10,751
Tucker

1125
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:12,031
Camp at Fox

1126
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:16,895
Like by being on the outside Alex did more to influence Fox News

1127
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:17,919
Then if you were inside

1128
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:23,039
That's probably true but that's not the place that you would want to be if you were able to

1129
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,855
It is not the like

1130
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:32,767
Fun or admirable or anyting place

1131
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:37,375
Down all the corporate money and all that it should be the admirable thing until you're Alex

1132
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:39,167
Then it's

1133
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,191
Disgusting

1134
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:42,751
And he probably do

1135
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:44,031
But

1136
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:46,847
There's a lot of a gold sale

1137
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:48,639
Stop going on

1138
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:50,687
No tab he doesn't pop

1139
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:54,271
Because he didn't actually give up the corporate money even in the slightest

1140
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:56,319
It's a little bit

1141
01:04:56,575 --> 01:05:00,927
Gold Corporation weirdo Corporation

1142
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:03,999
So there's an economic collapse talk being used

1143
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:06,047
Sell gold

1144
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:07,071
S*** predict

1145
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:08,863
People's layaway

1146
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,143
We're in the middle of the

1147
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:11,935
Play long time

1148
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:13,471
Expect to follow the line

1149
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:18,591
All the shopping center

1150
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,895
Mall restaurant

1151
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:24,991
Now are you

1152
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:43,167
Terrible

1153
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:46,751
For our economy

1154
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:52,383
Percent

1155
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,487
Play some good decision

1156
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,047
Remember the

1157
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:11,071
Call this stage

1158
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:12,351
Collapse

1159
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,375
Eventually

1160
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:20,031
Off-white

1161
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:21,311
Completed with the euro

1162
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:24,383
An agenda.

1163
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:25,407
Pawn America

1164
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,431
Indian currency

1165
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:32,575
Call Dale

1166
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:42,047
Can I borrow Ana Maro dollar

1167
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:46,399
2006 they rolled out the Amero dollar and everybody who is laughing at Alex

1168
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,935
Was not laughing anymore

1169
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:51,775
Bought all their gold that was that was what happened

1170
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:54,847
Change the course of history the Amero dollar

1171
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:57,407
I mean when you're right you're right

1172
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:06,111
Alex is going to be dead in five years in the Amero dollar timeframe you know like

1173
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:08,927
There's no way that $8

1174
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:10,975
Can come out in 3

1175
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:12,511
That's just not possible

1176
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,327
There's just too many interlocking part

1177
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:18,399
I mean like there were even like

1178
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:19,679
The dollar coins

1179
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:26,079
Was a difficult thing for I don't even think I was fully successful as a roll I

1180
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:32,479
Sacagawea

1181
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:38,879
I don't even know where we are

1182
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:40,415
An uproar

1183
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:46,303
And that means nothing compared to emerging different countries

1184
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:49,375
It's a slightly heavier representation

1185
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:50,911
Of the same thing

1186
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:52,191
Yep that's it

1187
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:55,263
So we go back to the

1188
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,799
Bombing

1189
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:58,591
In 1999

1190
01:07:58,847 --> 01:07:59,871
Trent Russia

1191
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:01,919
And like I said

1192
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:02,687
Proven

1193
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,503
I9

1194
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:06,783
September 9th

1195
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:07,551
P90

1196
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:08,831
Sickly the month following

1197
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,367
Seriously

1198
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:11,647
Explosion

1199
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:12,415
Complacent

1200
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:15,487
Which cave pool

1201
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:16,511
The pre-tax

1202
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:17,791
Say when launching

1203
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:19,839
Create Apple ID

1204
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:20,607
Stay at home

1205
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,191
KGB

1206
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,471
Rancho Chico

1207
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,263
Substituting the

1208
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:28,287
Domi explodes

1209
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:30,335
Wealex

1210
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:33,151
And then they will call but

1211
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:42,111
Prison Planet

1212
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:46,463
911

1213
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:47,743
You know I guess

1214
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:51,839
Buncha.

1215
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:55,679
The blow the whistle

1216
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:58,495
Trying to deport him

1217
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,567
Any journalist

1218
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:04,383
In Russia

1219
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:07,455
Strangely calm down

1220
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:08,479
Street

1221
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:16,927
Yeah well the none of this stuff is true anymore

1222
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:17,951
So weird how he

1223
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:18,719
He's the protector

1224
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:19,743
Picture of the white

1225
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:25,119
Which family now is great Christian Rush has never been known to do any false flag

1226
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,655
Huge

1227
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:27,935
Nothing more christ-like

1228
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:28,703
Weird

1229
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:33,823
That whole section on Prison Planet maybe not there anymore

1230
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:36,127
It is so nice to believe

1231
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:36,895
Give thanks

1232
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:43,039
It is really nice to just I don't have to worry about finding new things that I don't remember about

1233
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:45,855
Anza it's you don't like

1234
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:48,671
Forget that you prove things

1235
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:51,231
Can order to have proved the new things that are

1236
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:54,303
Contrary to those little things

1237
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:56,351
Who I was wrong and now there's anything

1238
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:59,167
Yeah this is

1239
01:09:59,423 --> 01:09:59,935
This sucks

1240
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:01,727
Anyway

1241
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:03,263
The caller calls

1242
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:05,055
Short leather collars do

1243
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:06,079
And he says

1244
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:07,359
Is Blue Collar white male here

1245
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:10,431
Better than that guy

1246
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:16,063
Another

1247
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:18,367
You're on the air

1248
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,719
For quite a while

1249
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:24,255
I'll be honest

1250
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:25,791
Start looking

1251
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:27,327
Your program I thought you're not

1252
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:30,655
Apologize

1253
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,431
Just the facts

1254
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,967
Wow on the Alex Jones

1255
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:47,551
The 2003 would think the 2022 version is a

1256
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:54,207
Yeah you constantly are evolving into something that would make you ashamed

1257
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:56,767
In the past

1258
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:57,535
That's not the

1259
01:10:57,791 --> 01:11:03,679
That's not the trajectory you want your life to go down

1260
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:07,775
Couple years ago I would have been so proud and impressed with what I achieve

1261
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:08,799
Totally

1262
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:15,199
What kind of past me would have been like well-done pat on the back

1263
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:19,039
Yourself in the past wouldn't be the top pasa

1264
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:22,879
That's the kind of things that yourself in the past

1265
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:29,279
Wanted to do you achieve things you don't have to disavow later

1266
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,559
I have to be like man the past

1267
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:35,423
I would have looked at me a bit like f*** that guy

1268
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:39,519
What a bummer

1269
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:48,991
This is the Christmas episode we are getting awful wistful about the Ghost of Christmas Past

1270
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:55,391
So worried about you constantly have layers of the onion peeled back and you see more rides dryer

1271
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:57,183
Okay so Alex is screwed

1272
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:59,487
Keep blowing your mind

1273
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:03,071
Paul Joseph Watson

1274
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:04,351
No he's not

1275
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:07,167
He's decided

1276
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:09,983
Oh boy

1277
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:14,847
David Knight is the fattened goose that sounds right

1278
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:17,919
I think David is actually a pretty good Ghost of Christmas present

1279
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:19,711
He's almost

1280
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:21,503
The same thing in the present analysis

1281
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:25,087
The best he could just show up and be like bet you wish you didn't fire me you dumb dumb

1282
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:30,719
The visual metaphor for Alex but I could be the Ghost of Christmas future be like

1283
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:37,119
You become me

1284
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:40,703
In this in this version I think everybody is reptile people

1285
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:41,983
The Ghost of Christmas Eve

1286
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:48,639
I'm about to turn in your Punchbowl now I am high hahaha altered

1287
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:53,247
So I went to the conception of what his show is

1288
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:56,063
And I think it's kind of funny because it is not

1289
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:56,831
This

1290
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:15,263
Absolutely not

1291
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:16,543
Wow

1292
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:19,359
So far from what his show

1293
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:25,759
Blurb put on the show you don't want to like come in from break and be like if your

1294
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:30,111
Joining us for the first time I make up bulshit based on skimming headline

1295
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:33,951
Try and make white people scared it is a little bit like if the

1296
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:36,511
The blurb on the back of the Bible was like

1297
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:38,559
Non-stop action Fest

1298
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:44,959
Packed with Jesus shooting all the Pharisees like now that with every percent less list of names

1299
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:49,055
So

1300
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:51,103
Alex talks about his JFK conspiracy

1301
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:52,383
We know from the present

1302
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:56,223
Nick Fuentes was just on the show and apparently Israel did it

1303
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:58,783
And Alex has a big part of it

1304
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:00,319
Weirdly not

1305
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:02,879
In the past 2003 that was not what he was

1306
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:06,463
He's proven that stuff isn't just like socks

1307
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:24,639
Jerry

1308
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:25,919
Private lawyer

1309
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,599
Murdered

1310
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:37,183
What is a demitted widow

1311
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:41,791
5 minutes away is that means that she was actually married to her by thing

1312
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:43,327
Admittedly

1313
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:46,911
He was admitted in the in the white papers

1314
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:48,447
She was wearing white

1315
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:51,263
Cuz it because users and now she's wearing black

1316
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:54,335
Admitted Widow

1317
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:55,871
Is it strange

1318
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:59,199
Turn afraid that's all I'm saying

1319
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:02,271
That was in 1800 that meant that she was in an asylum

1320
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:03,039
Haha

1321
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:06,367
Also wouldn't be ladybird

1322
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:07,647
Yes that would be

1323
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:11,487
Is Alex head lady American

1324
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:13,535
Royalty ladybird yes

1325
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:19,935
Correct I find that hard to believe that she was again starting forwards and told Alex that

1326
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:23,007
They plotted to kill JFK I think I think

1327
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:29,407
There's a fairly funny movie to be made it where all of the conspiracies are true and everybody shows

1328
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:32,479
Who's up in Texas on the same day kind of like

1329
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:34,527
Having an awkward mixer

1330
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:39,135
People are like all what are you here to Florida like I'm married to kill Kennedy and they like

1331
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:42,975
I don't know enough about LBJ so I don't know if like

1332
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:47,839
He got remarried or something like that he have another wife cuz that's the only one I know of

1333
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:50,143
Labor Johnson that's the only one I know of

1334
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:52,447
I think you actually maybe he did have another wife

1335
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:54,239
I'm looking at Wikipedia

1336
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:56,543
I seen one

1337
01:15:57,567 --> 01:16:01,919
Ladybird

1338
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:04,991
Please let's let's call it let's calm down on whether or not he was

1339
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:08,575
That would make somebody a admitted Widow

1340
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:09,343
Though

1341
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,111
Do you know

1342
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:12,671
You are not wrong

1343
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:14,719
If you're like

1344
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:21,119
Screwing around Taylor make you an animated Widow Widow first

1345
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:31,359
Actually times whenever she was not admitted

1346
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:36,735
Here's the question really is is admitted mean I have admitted to it

1347
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:41,599
Or you've been admitted into the halls of widowed up

1348
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:44,927
Century what are the previous hundred years was The Mentalist

1349
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:47,487
Institution so admitted into make sense

1350
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:48,767
I think that still count

1351
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:50,559
The point here is

1352
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:52,351
I don't know what's going on and Alex

1353
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:53,119
Conspiracy

1354
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:56,703
Linda Valdez real 2100 percent the Raichu

1355
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:57,983
Very very malleable

1356
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:00,287
Another call

1357
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:03,359
And in this club I think we get some insight into

1358
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:05,919
To what the left-right paradigm

1359
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:07,199
Memes to Alex

1360
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:08,223
It's not what you think

1361
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:11,295
The distinct impression that whenever I have a

1362
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:12,319
This is amore

1363
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:13,087
Complained

1364
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:13,855
About bush

1365
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:15,135
Like you said

1366
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:16,927
Become

1367
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:17,695
Like

1368
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:18,975
In League with the Liberals are

1369
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:36,639
Power

1370
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:47,903
I believe this is a really illuminate include to help us understand what Alex means when he says he's above the left-right paradigm

1371
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:51,231
Just based on the words and what they mean

1372
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:56,863
I think he means it is politics exist outside of the spectrum that defines things as left-leaning or right-leaning

1373
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:59,167
This is the way that he wants people to

1374
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:03,007
To see him because it helps make you more appealing to folks who fancy themselves

1375
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:05,311
Also to be above politics

1376
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:06,335
Finger right

1377
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:09,407
Actually mean is a bit different

1378
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:14,271
He opposes Bush and because of that people on the right assume he's on the left

1379
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:16,319
The left-right Paradigm he's again

1380
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:20,159
Is the assumption that because you oppose a republican you must be attacking

1381
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:20,927
From the left

1382
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:23,743
What Alex says he's above the left-right paradigm

1383
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:25,791
What is essentially saying is that he wants

1384
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:27,583
To make people aware that you can attack

1385
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:28,863
GOP from the right

1386
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:32,447
Yeah based on his use of the term in his clear ignorant about

1387
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:34,239
Pretty basic stuff in terms of politics

1388
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:41,407
I kind of think he doesn't understand that this is what he mean you are 100% correct it seems like he actually thinks that a

1389
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:47,551
Hacking the GOP from the right isn't involved political position that places him outside of the left-right binary

1390
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:48,319
But it does

1391
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:51,135
He's outside of the left-right paradigm

1392
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:53,183
He's on the right left parody

1393
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:55,743
See it makes perfect sense everybody

1394
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:57,023
That is on his team

1395
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:57,791
What is on the right

1396
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:59,071
And everybody else is on the left

1397
01:18:59,327 --> 01:18:59,839
Right

1398
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:00,607
He thinks

1399
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:06,495
He's on the these are meaning

1400
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:08,031
Political Spectrum

1401
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:10,335
Putting what we think of as the right

1402
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:11,359
On the left

1403
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:12,895
Side of the spectrum

1404
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:15,711
Taking part of further apart right of the Spectre

1405
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:17,759
That's the only right

1406
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:21,343
You can diagram it out

1407
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:23,391
It's okay Paradise

1408
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:24,671
And that's why I

1409
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:26,975
Far-right position

1410
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:30,815
Lottery position why would you say that they're not common sense

1411
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:37,215
I'm a Centrist because I believe in hyper nationalism it doesn't get more

1412
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:41,055
More middle-of-the-road than murder your enemies of which

1413
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:47,455
All you get a lot of mileage out of saying stuff like I'm above the left-right paradigm

1414
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:49,247
Guilty people who are independent

1415
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:50,783
Oriented

1416
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:52,319
You think like a man maybe

1417
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:53,343
Did this guy have some

1418
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:55,135
Some stuff that goes a little laugh

1419
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:56,927
The little right you know how

1420
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:57,951
No it's just

1421
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:59,999
So far on the right

1422
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:00,767
I mean

1423
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:03,327
What he's really saying is I defied political

1424
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:05,887
Party I think both political parties are b*******

1425
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:06,655
Which

1426
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:09,471
Is is fine but that doesn't make it like I'm

1427
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:13,311
I think both political parties parties are b******* but I'm on the left

1428
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:17,152
Yeah mean that I'm

1429
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:20,480
Yeah left-right Paradigm you can have

1430
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:26,624
Structural problems with both political parties and still recognize that you exist within the

1431
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,648
Continue exactly

1432
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:29,440
And Alex is trying to pretend that he

1433
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:30,208
He doesn't

1434
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:31,488
The game traction

1435
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,048
And make himself seem like a less of a

1436
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:35,328
Extremists on the right

1437
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:40,448
I mean if you're if you're the f****** Amitabha Buddha yes you exist outside the left-right Spectrum

1438
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:41,472
I agree with

1439
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:44,544
If you're somebody who doesn't have like

1440
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:46,848
Concern for pollen

1441
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:51,712
It exists outside like someone who maybe all you care about is charity

1442
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:56,320
All you do is live in a cave

1443
01:20:56,576 --> 01:21:02,208
I think that also is outside the left-right Paradigm that's a good point there's a lot of people point

1444
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:03,744
A lot of factions caves out there

1445
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:05,280
That was a felon

1446
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:11,168
Because you have not been to the Appalachian Mountain

1447
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:12,704
Some of those caves turn your fashion

1448
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:13,728
I'm telling

1449
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:17,312
Not been there

1450
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:20,128
So we get one last year and it's another caller

1451
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:22,432
And he has a question for Alex about source

1452
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:24,736
Because

1453
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:26,528
This is a non-answer

1454
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:28,832
Yeah you're doing stir great job

1455
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:29,856
I have a

1456
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:30,880
One main quest

1457
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:32,416
Can I actually meant I'll let you go under

1458
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:34,208
Today

1459
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:35,232
The global policy

1460
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:36,512
You were referring to

1461
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:37,792
Tower

1462
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:39,584
You said that you write with

1463
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,352
What's the size of the Moon

1464
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:41,120
Is based off of

1465
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:42,656
How do you obtain those

1466
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:54,688
Where's where's

1467
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:00,064
Foreign affairs

1468
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:01,856
Propaganda

1469
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:08,512
Congress

1470
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:14,912
Project America

1471
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:24,384
Operation

1472
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:43,840
Report

1473
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:46,912
I do appreciate that

1474
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:48,960
That's definitely

1475
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:49,728
Send me in a different

1476
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:50,496
Directions

1477
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:52,032
If you pay attention to that

1478
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:54,336
It's been really answer the question middelpos

1479
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:59,200
And the reason for that is that he doesn't bases conspiracy bulshit on an actual source

1480
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:05,600
He skims headlines and makes up stories that are complementary to his extreme right-wing white identity ideology

1481
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:11,232
Endpoints to have a gun specific mass of official documents to give his narratives and unearned weight

1482
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,536
I've tracked Alex's answer

1483
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:17,888
Here is what he says in response to a very straightforward question about where the

1484
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:19,680
These reports are that he's talking about

1485
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:24,800
First he brings up the CFR who have about 25 different kinds of

1486
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:25,568
Courtright

1487
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:30,432
This seems to imply that all of these kinds of reports spring forth from the CFR

1488
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:31,200
Maybe

1489
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:32,736
So they put up for an affair

1490
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:37,600
This is a public facing propaganda Outlet so that's not actually what we're talkin

1491
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:40,416
It might still be one of the types of reports

1492
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:41,696
But it's still coded

1493
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:46,816
Is he completely on specific reference to all sorts of other reports

1494
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:51,936
Set the CFR puts out to the president or internally or interdepartmental briefs

1495
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:54,496
Whatever the f*** that means

1496
01:23:54,752 --> 01:24:00,896
Departments of what department of evil in the department of

1497
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:02,688
Tell their true plans

1498
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:06,016
You can see how this doesn't answer the caller's question at all

1499
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:09,088
Pinac the Carnegie Foundation

1500
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:11,904
Add the Ford Foundation battle plans

1501
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:15,744
Corporation these things are just name-drop

1502
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,096
But hearing these names doesn't help anyone find the sources Alex's talk

1503
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:20,864
Talking about

1504
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:21,632
Instacart

1505
01:24:21,888 --> 01:24:27,008
Ricky Foundation has worth going back to the 1930s how does he expect anyone to know where to look

1506
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:35,712
Is it just one type of report that they have I imagine the Carnegie Foundation has so many different types of reports

1507
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:38,272
You start to learn the names of the p

1508
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:40,576
People in these groups and you see them writing articles

1509
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:41,856
This is again

1510
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:43,904
Outward-facing propaganda but

1511
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:44,928
I guess you can use this

1512
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:45,696
Check your work

1513
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:48,768
Against these internal documents to illustrate that they're putting up

1514
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:50,560
Propaganda

1515
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:52,864
It's speaking openly and Secret

1516
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:55,680
But these document shows they're working towards a similar goal

1517
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:57,216
Right this is welcome

1518
01:24:57,472 --> 01:25:01,568
Completely useless as an answer to this caller because you have nowhere to go with

1519
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:02,592
What You've Been Told

1520
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:08,736
The colors obviously looking for more information and you would think that someone in Alex's position would be eager to give that person

1521
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:09,504
Some specifics

1522
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,552
About how they can find Hard Evidence

1523
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:13,088
What's the shows that Alex is right

1524
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:14,624
How about the nonsense that he spouts

1525
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:17,440
But in reality the last thing Alex wants

1526
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:19,744
Is there actually curious members of his audience

1527
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:20,512
Checking-in

1528
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:21,792
On any other ship

1529
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:25,376
The game he's playing only works if sourcing is left

1530
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:26,656
Invega non-exempt

1531
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:33,312
So when he's like this he does the equivalent of like gesturing wildly and acting like a kid was trying to blow

1532
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:34,336
What's a book report

1533
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:36,128
And that's that's what you see there

1534
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:42,016
Yeah it is it is two things like the first time I'm up boggled by him Bay like listen

1535
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:44,064
You're doing a great job I think you're a genie

1536
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:46,112
Anyways I have a quick question

1537
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:48,672
Which I think should be a foundational question

1538
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:50,464
Is what you said based on any

1539
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:52,768
To which Alex replies

1540
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:54,304
Okay I see what you want

1541
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,352
You want to find this needle in a haystack

1542
01:25:56,864 --> 01:26:03,008
What I'm going to do is I'm going to give you this a stick and it's going to give you this a lot of Haystacks

1543
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:04,800
I'm going to give you the exact over here

1544
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:05,824
It's in there

1545
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:12,224
Start digging dum-dum this Haystack is been growing since the 1930s to keep piling hay on it play it is

1546
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,504
Is it is almost

1547
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:18,112
Perfectly designed to sound like an answer while at the same time being there too

1548
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:24,512
To make you give up on trying to verify any ordinary overwhelmed

1549
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:27,328
We'll never find the thing that Alex is referencing

1550
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:31,936
In the premise of the question is even interesting to because it's like okay

1551
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:35,776
You are reporting on news right and I can read the

1552
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:39,872
The story in the paper and it doesn't say what you're saying which is an issue

1553
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:43,456
But it's not an issue because you insist that you've read these

1554
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:44,480
Global report

1555
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:46,272
Help you like

1556
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:48,576
Use it like a decoder ring

1557
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:51,392
You can see what's going on in this pistol right now

1558
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:52,416
I would like

1559
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:54,208
To see the decoder ring

1560
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:57,792
Right and right it's that needle in a house

1561
01:26:58,048 --> 01:27:00,096
Are you the tip of

1562
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:02,144
This beer then you don't get to touch my Dakota

1563
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,424
How about that

1564
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:05,984
How about I would like to check the work on your Dakota

1565
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:12,384
I didn't ask you to check my f****** work man I'm the tip of the goddamn spear the decoder ring is in my pocket you can't see it

1566
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:18,784
I'll never bring it out the decoder ring is literally everywhere and everything

1567
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,320
Enjoy

1568
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:23,392
The force is everywhere edit binds

1569
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:25,184
That's what it is okay

1570
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:31,840
I would say that the doc answer was a bit of a dog

1571
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:32,864
That's true

1572
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:36,704
Cable

1573
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:37,984
I don't know

1574
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:41,312
We end this

1575
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:42,848
2003 Excursion

1576
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:43,872
Yes

1577
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:45,664
Think there's been some Illuminating things

1578
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,968
There's some interesting stuff in there

1579
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:54,112
Still no no movement on the Saddam front right that's okay there's still a little while until he's discovered

1580
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:56,672
He will be fine

1581
01:27:56,928 --> 01:28:00,512
I was so fascinated by that Texas Family kidnapping

1582
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:02,304
It's

1583
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:06,144
It's just it's just weird to me

1584
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:08,192
That like you know Newsmax

1585
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:09,472
Wood

1586
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:11,520
Even with the?

1587
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:14,080
Put out the story without doing a little legwork in

1588
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:17,408
I'm finding these claims in the past that he's made

1589
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:19,456
And not have a follow-up question of why you

1590
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:20,224
Keep getting kidnapped

1591
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:26,624
Five Mexican government a lot more than normal people have been kidnapped

1592
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:30,976
Letting you go without incident

1593
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:31,744
0

1594
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:32,768
1 *

1595
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:39,168
I do appreciate the negligence that went into that story making it all the way to Alex repeating it and

1596
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:44,032
Declaring war on Mexico

1597
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:45,568
I just like

1598
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:46,592
Just like that that's

1599
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:47,616
The type of fig

1600
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:50,176
Where you hear that story and I at mean

1601
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:52,480
You and I both knew it immediately just like

1602
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:54,272
This is not a what

1603
01:28:54,784 --> 01:29:00,928
This motherfukers do it some other shift to a patient this is not a man

1604
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:04,768
His one-time admitted.

1605
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:08,352
The guy with the Courier

1606
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:10,912
Jordan will be back

1607
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:14,240
Another episode get back into the present

1608
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:18,336
Yeah

1609
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:19,104
Who knows

1610
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:20,896
Give me any

1611
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:23,456
Maybe we'll do an episode about caves

1612
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:25,760
Sounds interesting

1613
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:32,160
Appalachia my friend and then we'll see what happens whatever the case will be back but until then we have website

1614
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:37,280
Shoprite.com

1615
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:43,168
I will be back but until then I'm Neo I'm Leo I'm dzx Clark I'm the juiciest Ice Cube

1616
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:43,936
Its back

1617
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:46,240
Exactly what

1618
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:51,360
