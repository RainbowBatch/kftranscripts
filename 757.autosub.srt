Air Jordan

00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Dot-com

00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,792
I worship at the altar of a little bit about

7
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:12,192
Alex Jones Indie we are Dan

Take care

12
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:27,552
I don't know caring about myself at all hampering myself

13
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:30,880
Into consideration you know it's never been to part of my

14
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:35,744
My repertoire I thought about it

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,512
I have this beard

16
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,792
What can I do with it

17
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,328
I guess I can

18
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,608
Could like

19
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:47,008
Make a little sure you could do little things in a little braids yeah but I don't think that's me

20
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,824
Now That's My Style

21
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,896
Decided to explore beard oil

22
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,664
Beard oil

23
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,688
All right listen

24
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:00,320
A few years I was never I was never big lotion guy ago

25
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,344
My wife

26
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,648
She really bad and you know what

27
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:10,560
Better sure I don't know what the hell would appointment should be moist or something

28
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:16,960
I grow up in a place where they like men have hardtop skin like screen

29
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:20,032
Well I'm an I have I have tried this out

30
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,080
Yeah I am so far I noticed no difference

31
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:27,712
Why would I I don't feel my beard you don't I don't have a mirror in front of me

32
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:35,392
Hard with it with the smell of my dog

33
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:40,256
Play my face I have a uber Idols you're one of the Pinecone

34
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:44,352
Situation and the other is like a vanilla lavender

35
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,656
I like it

36
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,704
It's okay I'm going to

37
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:53,568
We'll see what happens

38
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,224
We saw we saw a banshees of inishmaan

39
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,760
Which is

40
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,576
Amazing it's done by the guy who did In Bruges

41
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,136
So it's Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson just being

42
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:13,536
Good acting at each other you know you're talkin to me and you say something like that could be a movie I couldn't give you a fan

43
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:19,936
That could be an art installation

44
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:23,776
Outside of ebbing Missouri but that one's really really good

45
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:24,800
Just great

46
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,080
Ireland

47
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,640
Here's the story

48
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,664
Here's the entire

49
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,712
One day

50
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,736

Wow that's

54
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,744
Loeber short plot synopsis

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,096
Is it a ending of a friendship that leads to a lot of Calamity or is

56
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,632
Is it okay

57
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,936
The traditional Irish tragedy

58
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,984
Very very funny and nothing good happens

59
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,752
To anyone ever

60
00:03:55,008 --> 00:04:01,152
See I was imagining a movie where like the actual end of the movie is like the end of the conversation.

61
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:07,552
My Dinner with Andre My Last Dinner with Andre

62
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,624
Jordan

63
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:14,464
Today we have an episode to go over time DVD and it is

64
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,280
December 13th 2022

65
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,727
This is an episode where Alex

66
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,519
Does a stupid thing

67
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:33,151
He decides that after the interview that he did with Nick Fuentes

68
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,479
You decide to have Nick back on

69
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,783
To talk about things

70
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:44,415
Brilliant maybe see what kind of Common Ground we can find if he doesn't

71
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,207
Maybe maybe

72
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,743
He's trying to bring him back from

73
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:52,607
You know have you considered this is a reverse Vader situation

74
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:56,191
Where or more accurately a Luke Skywalker and his nephews

75
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:56,959
Situation

76
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,519
I didn't I didn't think that because it's not

77
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:03,103
Edit very clearly wouldn't fit any of their psychology

78
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,199
It's a situation where

79
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:14,879
Alex has done this interview with ye where ye deny the Holocaust and talked about how we loved Hitler and all this

80
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,671
Hey man

81
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,951
Use code

82
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,535
Knox

83
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:27,935
Not addressed by it's what we all do no no no I'm not going to lie and also Hitler is wonderful

84
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:33,311
Don't understand if you don't like that it makes it look really obvious that we are lying

85
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:39,711
Penetrates the market bubble that we have

86
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,015
Alex went on Steven Crowder show

87
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,831
I've started complaining about how he been done dirty

88
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,623
And

89
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,927
Criticizing him Beverly

90
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,999
It is very sad that Crowder consult him

91
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:57,887
And then Nick Fuentes came out and did his response were here said that Alex got a call

92
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,167
Right

93
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,471
From the Jewish handlers or

94
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,775
Jewish backers that I have

95
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:10,175
Answer that's the Prelude to this this interview I guess what Alex had heard that naked said

96
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,223
And decided

97
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:12,991
Why not

98
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,271
Have an interview

99
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,039
Debate

100
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,087
About about this stuff

101
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,647
Yeah and the great idea

102
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,927
It's a real

103
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:25,023
No it's a great idea no cuz he's going to he's so smart and

104
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,815
Charismatic and talented Alex

105
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,839
This is going to be able to

106
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:33,727
Scream him under the table there's no chance that anybody can beat him if it's a screaming match then yeah I do think

107
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,287
If there's that there's a good possibility of of that

108
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,311
But no

109
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,591
It's a

110
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,383
You know it's never it's never just

111
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,151
Screaming

112
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:41,919
Miami

113
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:46,527
And from something of an optical perspective just the fact that Nick is

114
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,551
Coming back on

115
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,831
Is a loss

116
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,599
For Alex

117
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,367
Add a win

118
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,903
4

119
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,671
4nickk

120
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,999
I have the mind

121
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,047
That

122
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,583
It's going on here is that Alex

123
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,351
Thanks

124
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,375
Picnic

125
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,679
Is somebody who can be reasoned with

126
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:10,335
He believes that make it is willing to play the game of using code and and and all that

127
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,615
Because that has been

128
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,639
Done in the past

129
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,967
I always was able to do business with him

130
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,247
54

131
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,551
A couple years he went on the stop

132
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,111
Bastille tour with him and Ali Alexander

133
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:27,231
It's so like I think that Alex is inviting him back on to give him a like

134
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
Look

135
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
Come on

136
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,047
We have this

137
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:34,655
We've done this before why are you why are you being so over

138
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,447
We're scammer doesn't work

139
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,471
You're not better

140
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:42,335
Right we're all scammers and just cuz you think you're doing something different your f***

141
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:47,711
Yeah and at the same time Alex needs to give some kind of a performative

142
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,735
Back

143
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,759
Push back

144
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:53,855
Do I donate don't hate anybody to the preceding

145
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,415
This this episode is

146
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,695
Tough

147
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,719
Because

148
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:04,863
Full disclosure recorded most of it decided this is

149
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,887
Beating a dead horse

150
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:12,287
As is our once we did about two hours and we were like that is just right but it

151
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:17,407
It's too much was a lot to go

152
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,479
And so on the Fly essentially just decided

153
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:25,087
Goodnight streamline this thing so it's not the same thing over and over again

154
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,647
Being like Alex is doing a bad job of this

155
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:31,743
Spoiler alert

156
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,791
For anybody who's who's who's

157
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,559
Afraid

158
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,375
Nick Fuentes is still a white supremacy

159
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,167
He did not suddenly changes

160
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,447
Is is June

161
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,287
No not really still too much of that

162
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,847
And so we have

163
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,895
Heritage valve called an audible

164
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,455
Sober before we get to that Audible

165
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,527
Dot-com is a sponsor

166
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,415
Audible.com

167
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,183

00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,999

Text a fruity little Necromancer thank you so much right now policy want

179
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,431
It's a have happened

180
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,735
A little of the past

181
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,271
My favorite part about this

182
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,831
Is that because we've already done this

183
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:06,719
I already forgot exactly what it was that we were doing and how long and how easily we forget

184
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:11,583
This is why maybe we could just do the same episode over and over again

185
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,215
You don't remember anything I've got a very Vibe every is flighty

186
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,775
I'd like to announce to you once again

187
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:23,615
The celebration of the nuptials of Miranda

188
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:27,967
Congratulate. Married on

189
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:33,855
October 29th congratulations and I now declare your wedding to be attacked

190
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,623
Democrats

191
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,647
I'm a policy wonk

192
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,415
I have

193
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,695
Risen above

194
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:38,975
My enemies

195
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,631
A little breaking for me

196
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,215
And then we're going to come back

197
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,287
And I'm going to start the show over

198
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,407
F*** you

199
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,687
F*** you

200
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:01,247
I got plenty of words for you but at the end of the day

201
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,295
F*** you and your new world order

202
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,343
And f****** horse you rode in on

203
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,879
And all your s***

204
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,159
Maybe today

205
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,487
Maybe I'll just be gone a month maybe 5 years

206
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,303
I'll walk out of here tomorrow

207
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,839
And you never see me again

208
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,143
Really what I want to do

209
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,935
I never want to come back

210
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,983
Apologize to

211
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,031
To the crew in the listener's yesterday that I

212
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,103
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

213
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,431
Better tomorrow sucks

214
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,455
Terrible Super-Sod

215
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:37,855
So bad

216
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,391
You know what

217
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,671
You know what is it is

218
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,207
Not our fault

219
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:48,607
It's not our fault you know much like me playing these clips for you it's not my fault

220
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,143
Actually my fault

221
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,935
It's partially our fault

222
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:57,055
Maybe better improvisers could have found it before unique ways to

223
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:03,455
Express wow wow wow we are not we are not them

224
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:08,575
This is going to be basically just a discussion of

225
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,343
Love Nikki

226
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,623
Debate with Alex

227
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:17,023
And then also the failings on Alex's Park

228
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,559
Before Nick shows up

229
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,095
It's

230
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,655
It's a no-man's-land there's not much going on there

231
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,679
It's

232
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,703
It's kind of just

233
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:30,079
A lot of Alex Lange track you know there's a lot of Alex trying to prepare the audience to

234
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,359
Except

235
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:37,503
Nick's arguments as not being bigoted

236
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,855
Batl is bad too and I think they're worse than anti-Semitism so

237
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,903
Even though I disagree with Nick Fuentes

238
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,951
Maybe we'll agree with something

239
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:52,351
On a on a scale of 1 to 10 - 1 and adl's and 11

240
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:55,935
That's basically that the audience

241
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,471
What's an excuse for

242
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:03,359
They like what they can say why it's okay with you

243
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:08,223
It's not because you're a bad person that wants to murder an entire race of people

244
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,247
Cuz

245
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,319
Tough to watch the ATL do things

246
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,879
It's just that they're so bad that Nick is good

247
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,695
Hitler's great it's so weird about half

248
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:21,023
And one other thing that happens is that Alex takes

249
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:21,791
Some calls

250
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,863
And what color in particular is

251
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,143
Completely off topic

252
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,727
And this is just heard of a novelist bougie

253
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,519
For Isis and doesn't slow down

254
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:36,127
Get ready to hear about a DMT trip cuz that brought Revelations of cyber Satan

255
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
And

256
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:44,831
Normalized

257
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,391
Cumulus media

258
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,695
What shows like

259
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,239
The later

260
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,287
Where gets weird

261
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,943
DMT in

262
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:14,783
Armageddon

263
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:18,879
The Manifest

264
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,671
Explain the artist

265
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,695
Elgin

266
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,719
You also

267
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,047
Summon Bell

268
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,007
104

269
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,287
Power of everyday

270
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,335
Like a network of

271
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,103
Neuron

272
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,431
Devices

273
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,735
Steals our art

274
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,599
It's like stop lights

275
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,647
Are the most powerful form of AI currently

276
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,207
Interface with it and follow his orders

277
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:58,559
America

278
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,863
Collectively we decide to do it

279
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,143
AI is only

280
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,215
Powerful as we make it thank you so much for the call

281
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,031
One of the things that I think the audience is deprived of

282
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,871
Is that when your incredulous about things

283
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:18,271
I just nod

284
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:22,111
I was given a vision

285
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:29,535
Is Chuck's out absolutely

286
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:35,679
Oh yeah so Cypress is coming and it's going to trick us into thinking it wrote Our books

287
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,703
Bayou

288
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,519
Appreciate whenever people are trying

289
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,799
They're bested like

290
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,591
Rectify

291
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,407
Dermatology of like you know though

292
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,479
Revelations are coming in the Antichrist and all that stuff

293
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,015
With reality

294
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:50,783
Of like

295
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,367
We're developing superintelligent machines that are probably going to

296
00:15:54,623 --> 00:16:00,767
Pass us eventually like we just know that they will sooner or later it's a matter of mathematics

297
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:07,167
Do have more intelligence than we do

298
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,215
Still not God

299
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,239
Still not God

300
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,287
I would I would say

301
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,567
If you

302
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,591
Are gearing up

303
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:19,711
I have a little debate with guy who may or may not be a Nazi

304
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:24,319
It really is funny that you're taking a call like this seriously

305
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,855
Maybe it's a bad sign

306
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:30,463
For you being the kind of show that can handle that kind of material when you're taking

307
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:35,327
DMT cyber Satan Revelation guy and end

308
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,863
The call that's a great point

309
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:43,263
Now you're totally right every civilization has ended the moment they tried to Summit Mall

310
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,567
What happened to golf

311
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,335
Summon ball

312
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:49,151
It rhymes

313
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,431
It probably mythology

314
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,991
Sign of the times

315
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,807
So what are the things that is

316
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:59,647
Critical to understand. Is that Alex is

317
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,927
Lost

318
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,719
Before anything even begin

319
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,303
This is before Nick has even started to the interview

320
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,863
Add / debate analysis

321
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:09,887
Fuct

322
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,423
I'd like to give

323
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,727
Time to give his Museum really going to talk to my

324
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,263
About him

325
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,287
Coming on today

326
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,871
Really went on there

327
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:25,247
Didn't know it was going on

328
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,807
I knew I was meeting with

329
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,439
Wasn't antisymmetric

330
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,231
What's some of the Jewish Mafia

331
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,047
Play me everybody's a Nazi doesn't agree with them

332
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,071
So I just kind of

333
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,375
All this really is an enigma

334
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,703
What's really going on show uncensored unfiltered

335
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,239
Nick Fuentes joins us

336
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,519
It's an enigma

337
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,055
You should sensor until 2

338
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,359
I would sensor in filter

339
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,175
I will and I think it I think it would be helpful

340
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,711
Yeah

341
00:17:56,223 --> 00:18:00,063
I think that Alex is setting the stage for Nick

342
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,135
To be able to make whatever argument he wants right

343
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,183
And Alex will have no foot

344
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,463
To the fall back

345
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,559
It is an irresponsible presentation

346
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,863
It's it's fun

347
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,191
Phyto to say on censored you know like

348
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,215
Uncensored

349
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,775
But like there's some times where you're like

350
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,055
Listen to things

351
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:24,895
Let's do a little censoring just a tad like maybe

352
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,175
The Holocaust denial

353
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,247
Yeah it's not

354
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:35,903
You know when you want to talk about all sides we hear all sides of a debate

355
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,207
I don't know if that side is

356
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,255
Is something that we really we have

357
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,559
A use for anymore

358
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,887
That's eventually

359
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,167
Alta Bates

360
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,191
End

361
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,471
When there is an answer

362
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,287
We come to a conclusion exactly

363
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,591
So there's no need to debate anyting

364
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,615
How about this

365
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,383
Whatsoever

366
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,455
Yeah I think I think to do so

367
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:03,039
It is indicative of we are positioned exactly

368
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,111
By talking about it you have already explained what

369
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,135
What's wrong

370
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:07,903
Reading

371
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:14,303
A holocaust denier as potentially right and having something to add into this conversation

372
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,095
UFO

373
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
That's not

374
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,703
Go away is how you treat

375
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,007
So Nick

376
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:26,335
Talks a little bit here at the beginning about the responses

377
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,871
To the interview

378
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:31,455
And he's just pulling out to some of these

379
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,223
Classic truck

380
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,807
I really can't say enough positive things about him

381
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,087
With regard

382
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,623
Words to the appearance on your

383
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,391
Show

384
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,927
What I've noticed is that

385
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,975
Jay has started this time

386
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,535
The Defcon 3 Tweed

387
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,559
About the Jews

388
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,095
He went on your show

389
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,631
And he said that he loves Hitler

390
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,167
And what's

391
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,703
The most remarkable about the

392
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,727
This is everybody

393
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,751
Fixated on the

394
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,519
Remark

395
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,543
What did you mean by that

396
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,335
What did you mean by you love him

397
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,615
What do you love about him

398
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,431
What is DEFCON mean is that a threat and so on

399
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,711
And he's done

400
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:08,575
Interview with Piers Morgan with Lex fridman with Tim pool with you

401
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343
With Gavin

402
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,135
And it all the interview

403
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,671
Still focused on

404
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,975
Focused on the Jewish

405
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,023
A lot of people they might say all well

406
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,559
Course that's an outrageous

407
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,351
This thing to say it's so provocative

408
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,655
And maybe that was the intention maybe was about

409
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,191
Publicity maybe we'll stay

410
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,983
But if you listen

411
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:30,847
If you listen to what the man is saying he has said what got us to this

412
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,639
But it's almost

413
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,687
It says something in it

414
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,735
Self that the conversation is about

415
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,503
The remark

416
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,039
Rather than all the

417
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:42,367
A my opinion far more outrageous things going on all around

418
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,183
Which is the right now the ATL shaking down Congress

419
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:49,279
If you listen to all of his interview that I mean

420
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,303
It's mostly

421
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,071
What lettuce

422
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,351
Here is grievance

423
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:57,727
Just weird things about gays personal life that he's decided to blame Jewish

424
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,751
People for

425
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,519
And

426
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:00,799
Dinner

427
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,335
Which complaint

428
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,407
These interviews were all like Hitler and do stuff

429
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,175
Is

430
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,199
Silly because

431
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,223
Skiing

432
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:11,807
That was where the ones who went

433
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,599
That was their idea

434
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:17,440
I've listened to a lot of interviews on Alex's show and

435
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,464
Outside of

436
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,768
That ingredient

437
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,608
Usually doesn't go that way

438
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,424
It was it was an anomaly

439
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:30,496
It is interesting

440
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,800
Ethnic did accidentally bring up a good point

441
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,592
When people ask

442
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,360
Yay what

443
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,640
Did you mean by that

444
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,920
It is

445
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,200
A dumb question

446
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:43,296
Yeah and it's indicative of not propaganda or anything along those lines

447
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:49,184
What is indicative of our culture being one where if you take what someone says at face value

448
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,208
You are a rube

449
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,048
Did not say I mean on TV or something along those lines

450
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,096
Because so much

451
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,120
Bulshit

452
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,424
Right is all over the place and everybody like

453
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:05,824
They get off on saying something and then you take him seriously.

454
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,592
But like

455
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:09,152
You don't need to ask why he what do you mean

456
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,176
He said what do you mean

457
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,480
Clear

458
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:18,112
It's absurdly clear clarified a number of times

459
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,160
What did the trick

460
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:23,488
Betnikh is using here is just as really just

461
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,280
Very very simple thing

462
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,352
Painfully transparent want to notice

463
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,264
What are you doing here is that he and ye came into the Inn for Studio went to all these other platforms and they said all this s***

464
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,800
There was a just over-the-top auntie

465
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:40,128
Cosmetic what is far as denying the Holocaust it was

466
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,152
Nonsense

467
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,456
This naturally has prompted a response

468
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:48,832
For people who find this s*** important and they've gotten a lot of criticism for this over-the-top 80's medic ship

469
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,928
Now Nick is coming back any second look at all these people are so folks

470
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,792
Suspicious that all this food

471
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:00,096
Feedback that we've gotten has been about the Jewish stuff

472
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,656
Does that kind of proves that we were right to begin with

473
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,472
Why aren't they talking about all this other

474
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,496
Stuff

475
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,520
Like

476
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,848
Ye feel weird about his trainers

477
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:13,664
Why are you why are you a dick

478
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,712
To deport nography and blaming it on your ex-wife

479
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,272
Can I ask you that question question

480
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,808
How are the Jews involved with that

481
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,856
I hope you still with that

482
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,904
The backlash that Nick wanted to provoke

483
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,232
Is being used to give the appearance of credibility to his initial point

484
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:31,072
It's mainly the Jews run everything and that they're trying to crush gay

485
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,608
Then all the people who would speak out

486
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,376
Against them

487
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,168
I think

488
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:36,960
District

489
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,008
Is so prominent

490
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,568
And again that Trolli

491
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,384
Ecosystem

492
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:48,992
Words like you to say something inflammatory you elicit the response that people

493
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:53,344
Would naturally have taken what you say at face value and then

494
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:59,744
You're like I can't believe that focused on responding to the thing that I said do you know what it is

495
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,280
This is the thing that I hate

496
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,560
So f****** much

497
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,328
It is

498
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,352
The dude

499
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:11,008
Who texts like hey do you want to go out I think you're hot or something and then they're like no just like

500
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,568
No I was just kidding about that I didn't actually want to do that

501
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,360
F******

502
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,128
Terrible

503
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,152
You're a coward

504
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,176
Yep

505
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:22,784
Nick said that the abl is shaking down

506
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,808
Congress

507
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,088
And here's what he was talkin to

508
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:25,856
About that

509
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,904
I know the ATL shaking down Congress

510
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,440
45

511
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,976
100 million-dollar

512
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,256
I don't know if people realize that

513
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,304
Submitted an Appropriations request

514
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,072
In response

515
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,608
Do the interview we did

516
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,888
Now you got

517
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,704
You know whether you thought it was entertaining whether you thought it was

518
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,984
Revolutionary

519
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:45,312
You have ye with a mask on with a Yoo-hoo internet

520
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,384
Madl shaking the couple times

521
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,432
We need 500 million dollars to finance

522
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,200
Semitism

523
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:51,968
It's outrageous

524
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,272
He's been banned from the bank he's at his deals

525
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:58,624
Shut down by Nike and Adidas to the tune of billions of dollars over 10 years

526
00:24:59,392 --> 00:24:59,904
And

527
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:04,000
The list goes on and on and on

528
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,792
What what people ask and I don't

529
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,608
That is gay secretly like

530
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,400
ATO operative to get them funding

531
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:15,264
You can see their how Alex has a mission and its

532
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,032
To create a

533
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:19,872
Sir distractions in order to keep the audience from focusing on the central point

534
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,664
And why any of this matter

535
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,968
At least when these kinds of issues are being

536
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,248
Disgusting when he needs to

537
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,040
Provide cover for big

538
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:33,952
I can't imagine anyone being seriously concerned that yeas whole thing has been a false Flags get the ATL more funding

539
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:37,280
Fwiw the ATL made the Appropriations request

540
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,560
What they're talking about that Nicki

541
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:43,680
You saying like it was in response to us in April

542
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,472
It's an application for Grants

543
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:49,824
And the 500 million dollar increase involves their nonprofit security grant program

544
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:55,456
This is something of a DL runs they quote provides nonprofits with the capacity to increase their defense

545
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,224
Against threats

546
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:59,808
Including physical security and cybersecurity capacity in Corydon

547
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:06,976
Nick wants to pretend that this is something that they didn't reaction to his and gays interview but that talking point just isn't true

548
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:10,048
Hate self-aggrandizement that makes it look like

549
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:13,376
Do the establishment is so scared of these things that we're doing

550
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,424
And yes it is much as

551
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,472
People are scared that

552
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,496
This rise

553
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,288
End in

554
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,312
Bigoted

555
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,360
Rhetoric will have the effect of emboldened

556
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,664
Inciting people towards violence

557
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,712
It's not that there

558
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,480
Scared of

559
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,296
Stock quote on quote

560
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,320
Yeah

561
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:35,392
You're saying

562
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,280
500 million

563
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:45,120
Put it in the bucket I need three times

564
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,680
Tumi

565
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,776
It's always bad

566
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,824
When you're dealing with someone like Nick

567
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,104
Who at this point

568
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,872
Has

569
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:59,712
Literally no reason not to just be pretty upfront about things

570
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,016
You don't really want to ask them

571
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,552
Cut-and-dry question

572
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,880
I am so Alex decides he's going to do that

573
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,648
I asked

574
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,416
Hey man

575
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,464
Do you admire Hitler

576
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,280
I can't imagine

577
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,840
Him thinking this would go any other way than it does

578
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,376
In my view just

579
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,912
What's the way

580
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,472
Do you actually admire at off Hitler

581
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,544
In some ways yes

582
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,336
And I'm not a

583
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,104
Socialize

584
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,200
Text and I'm not and I wouldn't identify that way because I'm a I'm a Christian

585
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:34,272
So I'm not any kind of a socialist or a fascist

586
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,832
I like ye believe we should have a Christian government

587
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,368
Christian country

588
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,392
God runs the world

589
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,672
We should have a government

590
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,696
In accordance with that but

591
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,488
But honestly I don't

592
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:46,304
Don't share this histrionic Jewish view that

593
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:47,584
Hitler is this

594
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,656
This exceptionally Boogeyman evil figure

595
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:53,472
All the 20th century is full of a viola

596
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,008
Tony chachere's bold

597
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,336
Authoritarian ideologies run rampant and and that's

598
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,384
The product of modernism and liberalism and

599
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,664
All kinds of Tren

600
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,688
But

601
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,968
But this idea there

602
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,504
I'd my life is a

603
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,272
Then anyway and Pat

604
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:11,392
Or I'd have a lot more animosity for the ATL I have a lot more intimacy

605
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,208
City for the COA I have a lot more animosity for the group

606
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,744
It actually made my life

607
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,024
My family

608
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,792
He really worse

609
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,584
Personally and acrossed

610
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,424
Sick of being expected

611
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,240
By Jewish median Holocaust Museum search

612
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,264
Beat my chest

613
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:31,104
Like you kind of did the other week until I hate Hitler I Heelers

614
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:36,992
Of course Nick has more animosity for those group cuz he doesn't have animosity for Hitler he likes Hitler

615
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:43,904
So make Express support for Catholic Fascist governments in the past and his views of Christianity are entirely compared

616
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,696
Potable with Theocratic fascism

617
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,256
He knows that he's just lying to Alex's audio

618
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,536
Has to be more palpable

619
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:55,936
Do not like the word facets Nono thrown at them a lot prefer is that you call it

620
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,960
Sharia law

621
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:02,592
And that Nick Fuentes is the new Ayatollah that's what they would prefer they would rather do that because

622
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,640
Is it completely different from what they want

623
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:09,504
Nick's construction of his feelings about Hitler historically it's a meaningless tape

624
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:16,416
He's coming at this with the position that's kind of close to there are a lot of bad figures who did bad things of the 20th century and Hitler is

625
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,440
Just one of them

626
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:22,816
What you might be something that's okay to say if you had just made an entire media campaign out of

627
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,352
Expressing your love for him

628
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,632
People aren't

629
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,912
Expected to beat their chest

630
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:27,936
Then say they hate him

631
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:33,056
Alex did that performatively because he ain't came on his show and said that s*** and Alex was trying to

632
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,592
Texas branding so the audience

633
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,616
Instant Runaway

634
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:42,272
I've never once felt the need to beat my chest and say I hate Hitler but maybe things are different when you're a media figure who keeps saying

635
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,296
You like Hitler

636
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:47,904
Maybe if that's your reality people want you to walk it back cuz it's insane and dangerous

637
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:51,744
You don't okay maybe it's subjective and unique to Nix

638
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,144
Experience I'll give you I'll give you a

639
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,704
Like that I'll give you that let's take it out of there

640
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,496
I've never been asked

641
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,776
To thump my chest

642
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:06,592
And say that couch SQ was bad

643
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:10,432
If a single person came up to me and said you know ceausescu us

644
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:13,504
It's a good idea that I would run away from them as fast as I could

645
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:20,160
You must beat your chest and say that Slobodan milosevic was bad

646
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:24,256
But if you say you wasn't

647
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,792
That's the problem

648
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:28,096
Well it it raises some questions

649
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,656
So

650
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,704
Nick has gone out

651
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,752
On his Twitter spaces

652
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,800
He said that Alex got a call

653
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:40,896
That made him turn on ye and himself

654
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:44,992
He got them and so this is discussed Alex really wants to know like

655
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:45,760
Hey man

656
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:48,576
Did you make that I got a call

657
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,112
I legitimately

658
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,904
Stalin hate Mao

659
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,184
Hate Hitler

660
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,744
Wallpaper Rock Obama

661
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,280
Hate the Democratic Party

662
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,840
And I've always remember me on Piers Morgan

663
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,632
I didn't get a call from the ATL

664
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,704
Popular thing ever did

665
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,104
Back then

666
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,384
I said Hitler

667
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,200
Mal took the gun

668
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:18,528
Gun 1776 will commence again

669
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,576
I've always criticized

670
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,344
Hitler

671
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,648
I made documentaries about the Bush family

672
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:26,976
Helping fund Hitler and the British royalty show

673
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:29,280
Where we have a sticking point is is that

674
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:33,888
As you as you sit on social media and I'm just curious

675
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,192
Do you think I actually got a call

676
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:39,264
To come out and criticize Hitler you think that's a new thing for me

677
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:44,640
No no I know that you're very vocally anti-hitler over the years I know the year

678
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,944
More of a Libertarian and so you have the

679
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,968
This view of History which

680
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,272
Which lumps in together Mouse Tale

681
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,320
Antler is authoritarianism versus

682
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,112
Freedom Fighters

683
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:54,880
Capitalist

684
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,488
Washington Thomas Jefferson I'm familiar with your showing all of that

685
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,840
And and honestly was a little bit glad you called me Baby Hitler I said you got a

686
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,608
Call

687
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,192
And I'll quite honestly it's banned through but it is well known that you

688
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,472
Don't really talk about this

689
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,264
Tissue your ear more talking about

690
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,312
New World Order Bill Gates

691
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,336
It's in any sort of a

692
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,104
Obscure

693
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,896
Conspiracy theories like Bilderberg

694
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:20,224
My shows a lot more focused on you know what you might call the Jewish

695
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,528
Question which is what are we to do about this

696
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,552
Jewish Elite

697
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,600
Is it run or Chris

698
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,648
Christian country

699
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:33,024
So apparently this s*** talking

700
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:39,424
The two of them dead is a primary issue for Alex really needs to be hashed out which is just as easy as

701
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,448
Connecting like are we talkin

702
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,752
You said that I said days

703
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,056
Now that we've squash that beef

704
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,848
I just want to remind you

705
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,872
That I want

706
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:50,688
Ultimate power to remove Jews from this

707
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,456
This Earth

708
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:56,576
I want you to be reminded that I mean this

709
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,112
I don't think you got a call

710
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:04,000
Because I do want to murder all the Jews wait hold on so this is a devastating

711
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,280
Moment for Alex

712
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,816
There's three things

713
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:09,120
And that clip that I think are a real problem

714
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:09,888
For him

715
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,912
The first

716
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:17,312
Thing is that Alex is coming face-to-face with someone who is smart quick-witted charismatic and understands the Infowars

717
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,080
Talking points

718
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:24,480
Nick watched Alex in the past so he knows what Alex preaches and because of that he's going to be able to brush aside these now

719
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,016
I heard is really easily

720
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:32,160
You can see the way that Nick present himself is being this hot like talk about high-minded things whereas

721
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:35,488
Traffics in obscure conspiracy stuff like the Bilderberg Group

722
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,144
Nick is asserting himself as high-status here and also putting Alex on notice that he isn't afraid to bring up the Bilderberg Group and sell

723
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,192
And if it out and if Alex does

724
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,472
You better be careful

725
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:48,288
Because I might know some stuff about this I mean

726
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:53,152
It is your tricks out your Jedi Mind Tricks aren't going to work it is it is like he's been

727
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:57,248
Whoever he's been doing his homework for his whole life watching this s*** you know like Alex

728
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,832
It's like it's like the Douglas Adams

729
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,880
I think

730
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,416
Long dark

731
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:07,488
So there's a Electric Monk

732
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,768
Sitting on a horse

733
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,304
Another horse

734
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,584
Tons of thoughts

735
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,120
All about the Electric Monk

736
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,912
Right now the Electric Mud

737
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,752
It's easier to sit on top of something and never have a single thought about

738
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,032
Like that kind of thing

739
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,056
Like Alex

740
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,360
Has sat on top of Nick Fuentes is

741
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,384
Bulshit

742
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,432
He's put it on his dumb website

743
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,712
And he's never watched

744
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:31,040
Single hole absolutely not one second yes

745
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,088
Not a second

746
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:37,184
It's not his shop has never watched the America first

747
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,304
Concerned himself with that because he doesn't yeah it doesn't give a s*** where is Nick knows the

748
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:48,960
Nick knows what he's dealing with Alex doesn't know what he's doing

749
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,752
Practically know what Alex

750
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:55,360
Is going to say before he says it because he says the same s*** every

751
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,128
Yeah

752
00:34:56,384 --> 00:35:01,760
So the second thing Alex should be worried about is Nick saying it's well-known that you don't really talk about this issue

753
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:06,880
If anybody is familiar with the way of the Nick in the groin purrs

754
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,952
Confronting Turning Point USA

755
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:15,840
They would hear some similarities between this there's a there's a resonant Echo

756
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,120
Yeah that's there

757
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:23,776
The third thing is that Nick literally said that his show deals with the Jewish question and Alex said there's a

758
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,312
The good debate to have there

759
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:32,224
No one and I mean no one outside of white supremacist white nationalist or Neo-Nazi communities uses terms like the juice

760
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,784
Which question or the abbreviation take you

761
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:39,904
I guess people who Monitor and criticize those communities are historians might use the term to but you get what I mean

762
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,440
That ain't a dog whistle

763
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,464
Later the bullhorn

764
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,512
It's a little tiny bullhorn

765
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,792
Has a big old bull horn

766
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:50,144
Alex either not grasp that or hear it and go along with it is damn

767
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:55,008
He can only mean that he's either in support of Nick's 80s medic ideology or that he's in

768
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,800
No way equipped have these conversations

769
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:00,896
And every time he does he's just going to get run over by the person he's interviewing

770
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,432
It's a

771
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,968
Very very bad

772
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:05,504
Yeah I mean there's no

773
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,808
If you say the Jewish question

774
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:11,904
Interview over

775
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,024
What the question is what do we do about a race of people that I think

776
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,072
Are biologically evil

777
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,352
By birth

778
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,400
From Satan himself

779
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,192
That's not a question of like

780
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,776
Do we give them better schools

781
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,056
That's not how that's going to

782
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,616
No it's

783
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,920
There's there's nowhere to go

784
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:38,784
These kinds of things have been been uttered and it gets worse

785
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,880
And I would call the FDA

786
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:43,904
Text Roxanne

787
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,184
The federal regulators

788
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:45,952
You all

789
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,256
We are Jewish

790
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,304
We're out there doing that

791
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:54,400
You're hiding behind Judaism but I don't then blame

792
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:58,240
The average Jew for that so I think that's the difference and you were on

793
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:02,592
With Gavin McInnes and he's like

794
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,128
Fortunate more crime

795
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:04,896
The other group

796
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:10,016
You don't just blame me a black person you just not trusted you when they come in the room and yagos

797
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,296
I don't know

798
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,856
To me that that's what I'm saying is

799
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,648
I do believe Martin Luther King

800
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,952
That we judge individuals by who they are

801
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:22,816
And what they do not buy what color they are where they're from but

802
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,144
I agree with that in

803
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,192
Principal but we also have to understand that it's

804
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:28,960
It's not the thief

805
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:29,984
People happen to be

806
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,264
The Jewish I think that's the big

807
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,544
Source of the disagreement

808
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,104
Is Lisa it were told in in the last

809
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:35,872
Ashby weeks

810
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,664
When ye makes these remarks

811
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,224
What about the Jewish media Jewish Hollywood or Solana

812
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,504
These are individual

813
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,528
These are people that

814
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,808
We've got a name them into the

815
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,112
Visually and these are people that happen to be bad

816
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,136
Or rather they are

817
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,232
But I think there's something about their Jewish

818
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,536
Nest that that makes it this way

819
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,584
And I think that that is really the source

820
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,120
Of the disagreement

821
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:01,472
See when somebody says the Jewish question that's why you went the interview because

822
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,312
At that moment right there Alex

823
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,080
So just be like

824
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:12,480
I got nothing I can't I can't do this I've clearly failed I f***** up weave

825
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:16,832
Jewishness is itself a problem you're f****** bad goodbye

826
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:19,904
Yeah if you're Alex you tried to suggest to Nick that he's making

827
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,232
Composition fallacy where you take the characteristics of an individual

828
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,024
And then applies it to an entire group

829
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:25,792
Onyxia

830
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,072
Nope I disagree

831
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,632
There's something about being Jewish that makes a person bad

832
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,424
At that point you reach this

833
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,728
A disagreement that words will not solve

834
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,776
If you're naked this point

835
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:38,080
You have to be thinking that you're crushing Alec

836
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:45,248
Eyelash when Nick said the Jewish question Nick has reaffirmed his admiration for Hitler and now he's

837
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:47,296
Buchanan Martin Luther King's ideology

838
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,856
In favor of anti-Semitism and Alex has enough

839
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:54,720
You just floundering here giving Nick 101 level responses that are basically softballs

840
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,768
It's pathetic to see really but

841
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,560
I don't know why you would expect anything else

842
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,584
Yeah man

843
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,632
That's such

844
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,936
That's such like a

845
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,472
Thank God

846
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,288
That it's not me and Nick in a room

847
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,080
Together having this quote on quote

848
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:10,848
Debate

849
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,128
Because that's throwing hands

850
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:15,712
I mean that's it that's just say it to my face

851
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,992
That's throwing hands.

852
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:22,368
It's at least we're done here till I mean at the very least at the least

853
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,136
Yes

854
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,416
Yes it's ugly

855
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,976
So Alex

856
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,512
Tries to get

857
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,536
A question out

858
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:35,936
And what are the things that he seems really preoccupied with is this notion that there's a conspiracy going around

859
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,472
Are you secretly fundraising

860
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,496
For the 80s

861
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:42,592
Is there Alex is trying to get that question out but then he reveals something that

862
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,872
I think is important to wreck

863
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,944
I asked earlier that I forgot to get back to

864
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:51,296
Video was 500 million they want more control over Society because of

865
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,368
Kanye West yazel comments here

866
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:56,160
I get he's obviously not a threat

867
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,952
He doesn't control People's Bank account

868
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,232
That's a joke

869
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:01,280
But then people say is

870
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,304
Yay

871
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,840
Really working for them

872
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,632
The first wearing red hats

873
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,936
Caesar Trump supporter and now come out to do this

874
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,984
I've been around him I'll talk to him a lot

875
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,032
For a long time

876
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,568
And I really don't think that's the case

877
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,640
You know

878
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,920
Nicastro niacin

879
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:21,504
Happy office

880
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:25,088
Jones did all that to poor neck

881
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,672
Yay for a long time

882
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,208
He never come on the show

883
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,256
I gave his number to

884
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,280
Other folks

885
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:35,072
Come on to Milo yiannopoulos

886
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,120
He got that point doesn't touch with him

887
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:42,496
But that was fine

888
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,776
Know where you want to go

889
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,824
I wanted to talk to him I gave him the number

890
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,104
That's shocking

891
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,176
Pianos as the

892
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,480
The history books will be written

893
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,248
Alex

894
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,904
The central Hub in the middle of these wheels

895
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,440
You have a good argument

896
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:06,304
And I'm not sure where that ends what you have to blame Alex like

897
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:12,704
Literally throughout your day you might experience something that you probably could argue is Alex's fault you sound

898
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,312
About to do like a class action lawsuit commercial

899
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:23,712
Look at all they have a case all this f****** s*** yeah

900
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:25,248
It's very strange.

901
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,784
Considerate like I have

902
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,808
Some

903
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:34,464
Concern or worried that these these kinds of bigots and folks would find each other naturally at some point

904
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,744
Like their orbits

905
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:39,072
Artrac big and they kind of overlap so

906
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,864
There's a chance

907
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,144
And ye would meet

908
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,168
At some point

909
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:43,936
But

910
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,216
In the real world

911
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:48,032
The way it did happen was that

912
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:54,431
Milo wanted to talk to you because he was excited about the anti-semitic s*** he was putting out so he contacted Al

913
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,223
Alex got him in touch

914
00:41:56,479 --> 00:42:00,319
And then Milo cuz he wouldn't go on his show so Milo got him and brought

915
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:05,951
When testing and now they've got the thing and not Milo's gone to Milo's out there all f****** stupid

916
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:09,535
How do you spell I think I think that that is a Hallmark

917
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,327
Of chaotic

918
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:15,423
Campaign slogan he remember all the Intrigue about who's in who's out with

919
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,983
Stuff like I wouldn't expect anything else

920
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,263
I just wouldn't

921
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:22,079
Expected by low to last that short

922
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:31,807
Has been

923
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:35,391
Thanks so Central to so many things to get sued

924
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,927
The wild problem is

925
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:40,255
Most likely a coincident see the Forrest Gump

926
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:46,655
To me it's a little bit like like like a Beatles you know like they're there was a time was right

927
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:49,983
Pipe for a thing to happen you know it if you remove the Beatles

928
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:53,823
You're going to have something Beatles like take their space

929
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,359
That kind of plan probably nothing

930
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,383
Monkey

931
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:59,199
I don't know that they were bad

932
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:03,551
But like if Alex was gone the what-if

933
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:09,951
This gaping hole ripped in our society if Alex was not there in the past is so cute

934
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,743
Well you know.

935
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:16,351
Conceivably it still have like Rush Limbaugh all that stuff

936
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:18,399
That takes care of a lot

937
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:24,799
A lot but they're yeah there are peculiarities of Alex's psycho see use them in his idiosyncrasy

938
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,151
Set really do end up affecting things

939
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,175
It is

940
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:32,223
And the kids marginalization

941
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:36,319
There's so much of his career his life to him associating with so many

942
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:40,159
People that other like a rush wouldn't associate

943
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,231
You connected

944
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:45,791
At the right

945
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:47,327
Time to be the right

946
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,351
Piece of s***

947
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:49,375
To do this

948
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,911
And there's

949
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:55,775
There's maybe an argument to be made in a in a much larger four dimensional sense

950
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,055
Of what

951
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,079
He was

952
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,615
PlayStation 2

953
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:02,431
Was the reason that his downfall occur

954
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:06,271
You know like if he hadn't been the person in that place at that time

955
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,063
Then maybe his life would have gone

956
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:10,367
Absolutely would have gone differently

957
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,903
But maybe it would have been his self

958
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:12,671
Destructive

959
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,207
Yeah you know

960
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,231
Probably

961
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:19,327
So like a lot of pushback that Alex's giving is

962
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,863
Is not good

963
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:25,471
It doesn't help make his point sometimes it even helps make Nick and gays point

964
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:28,799
The time it is just the softballs

965
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,591
That make him

966
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:36,991
The handle no problem like hazy a secretly fundraising yadiel this is worthless a waste of time

967
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,039
So we skip to Nick

968
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,831
Boosting yay for

969
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,111
And

970
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,647
Alex gets a little bit concerned

971
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:44,671
Musicman what about rain

972
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,815
Because I'm so so I ran Paul

973
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,863
We're supposed to believe our two

974
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,679
24-hour going to be DeSantis and Trump

975
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:56,959
DeSantis I

976
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:57,727
I think you like him

977
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,775
I'm not really huge fan

978
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,799
And Trump like I

979
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,335
I said in a very moderate

980
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,103
Forum

981
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:06,943
Low energy and I still love him I still die for him I die still

982
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,503
He's a Great Hero on one of the Great American

983
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,807
But is that the same guy that he wasn't sick

984
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:14,111
16 everybody

985
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:16,415
You're not

986
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,695
Young guy

987
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,975
In the last couple months

988
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:21,023
With everything is going going on is

989
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,327
Here's something out of all the

990
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,351
Stop the wheel

991
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,631
You & I in the last

992
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,911
Last two years and many others

993
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,191
Between January

994
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:31,519
Jamaican election

995
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,287
Finally

996
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,567
A light at the end of the

997
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:35,359
Tunnel here is finally a North

998
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,639
Star west

999
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:37,919
Pandora baby

1000
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:41,247
Star or something that we can finally look at it and at

1001
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:44,319
Actually get excited about what happened.

1002
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,391
And what about

1003
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,999
You know I like Rand Paul

1004
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,535
I like him a lot I met him at

1005
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:56,095
2016 and I actually worked

1006
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,631
Maybe I can work on it

1007
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:58,911
Campaign I think I can paint with

1008
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:01,727
Cruise actually during the Republican primary in 16 but

1009
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:02,751
How is interlacing

1010
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,055
Reporter that when I'm talking about when I was a senior in high school

1011
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,847
I was just supporter of his ice

1012
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:07,615
Still am I thinking

1013
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,639
He's very intelligent

1014
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,175
He's a libertarian

1015
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:12,223
And he's just not really my kind of

1016
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:16,063
Conservative I know you're more libertana but I think there's more overlap

1017
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:18,879
I'm really more in favor of bringing back of

1018
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,927
Strong fashion flavor

1019
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:21,951
Nationalism

1020
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,023
That term I feel like it's being hijacked

1021
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,583
I want the government

1022
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,375
And I want us to have a true National

1023
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:39,615
Thought that's what he's got star in yay

1024
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:42,687
We can all follow in Alex's room

1025
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:44,735
Let's go off on that

1026
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:45,503
But then

1027
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:48,063
This I want Christian nationalism

1028
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:54,463
And I think the term nationalism is hijacked people like Alex

1029
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,999
Implied

1030
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:59,071
People like Alex at days are Father's Day

1031
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,351
Anti-christian

1032
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,911
Straight straight bro

1033
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:03,935
Exchange was it

1034
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:08,543
Exactly like if somebody ask their dad what they think about ye and their dad was like

1035
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,823
What do you think about that

1036
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:16,991
I think I've been there been some others have to like and whatever

1037
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,527
So just like man

1038
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:22,879
You are far away from the conversation that I am having right

1039
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:27,487
Is a

1040
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:31,071
Don't say more about why we should follow yet

1041
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,399
So they go to Commercial and they come back

1042
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,447
And Alex plays a clip

1043
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:41,311
From a mid-november episode of America first

1044
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,591
Yeah Nick

1045
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,615
Now

1046
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,639
In fairness

1047
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,943
This was a cliff that they took from rightwingwatch

1048
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,991
So it's not like Alex watched

1049
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,015
Big Show

1050
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:51,807
Clip

1051
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:53,599
Is incredibly f*****

1052
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:54,879
And

1053
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,207
Listen to the app

1054
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:01,279
Episode are the parts of the episode that these clips come

1055
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,047
From

1056
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,071
And they are not out of town

1057
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:05,887
I will assure you they are in contacts

1058
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,423
And Incredibly f*****-up

1059
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:09,215
And I don't know why Alex played this

1060
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:11,263
The Jews

1061
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,543
Here's the silver lining

1062
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,847
It tends to go from 0 to

1063
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,127
Like they're not wrong

1064
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,175
But there's a reason

1065
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,711
For that and the reason

1066
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:21,247
Is that

1067
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,039
Do the Jews

1068
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,831
Every society

1069
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,599
Anywhere

1070
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:26,879
Is gone down with the

1071
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:29,951
Always

1072
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,047
Paris

1073
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:34,815
Okay

1074
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,095
Never starts

1075
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,167
Frequently

1076
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,703
It seems to end that way

1077
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,239
And it gets there

1078
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,263
Very rad

1079
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,311
Doesn't start there

1080
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:46,591
Bharat

1081
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,359
Frequently

1082
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,919
But I would say that the Jews

1083
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:51,967
I better start being nice

1084
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:53,247
Two people I got

1085
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,295
Because

1086
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:56,831
What comes

1087
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,879
Is going to be a lot

1088
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,415
Uglier and a lot

1089
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:01,951
Anything is

1090
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,351
I didn't bully by the Jews and

1091
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,631
I've been depressed

1092
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:10,655
And slandered

1093
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,423
Jordan lied about

1094
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,191
I'm attacked by the

1095
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:12,959
Statues

1096
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:14,239
I have been

1097
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:15,775
Precise

1098
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,055
The most part

1099
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:18,591
And even-handed

1100
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,895
And nuanced about my

1101
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:21,663
Review about

1102
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,991
And I'm also Chris

1103
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:30,879
Because

1104
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,159
There

1105
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:32,927
Could be a lot worse

1106
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:34,719
Michelle

1107
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:37,535
And what's going to come out

1108
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:40,351
I could be a lot uglier

1109
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:43,423
Don't we stay on the shell Dino that there are other people that

1110
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:44,959
Farther than that

1111
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,519
Conversation really starts

1112
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,055
And the Jews are going to look at

1113
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,335
People like me in America

1114
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,871
The first and say damn

1115
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,663
I miss

1116
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,199
Someone was just that funny

1117
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:55,967
Guy

1118
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,039
Missanabie

1119
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,391
It's going

1120
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:06,719
So I don't know why Alex

1121
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:08,255
Would play that

1122
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:11,583
Because it reveals something to the audience

1123
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,887
And that is this

1124
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,423
On his own show

1125
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,703
Jeff and

1126
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:19,775
He's talkin fairly similar Leon Alex

1127
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:21,311
The show but a little bit looser

1128
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:27,199
He has the the Jews should be nicer to me because it's going to get bad

1129
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,735
It's going to get worse later

1130
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:33,855
Laughing about it going from 0 to 60 once these conversations get going

1131
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:34,879
Switch

1132
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,927
Even by his own admission

1133
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:39,999
He's trying to get these conversation started

1134
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,815
I think it gives a pro

1135
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:45,119
Pretty particular image of

1136
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:45,887
What Nick is

1137
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:46,911
Who he is

1138
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:47,935
What he believes

1139
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:48,959
What like

1140
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:54,079
I don't understand why if you're listening to this or watching

1141
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:54,847
Sing the show

1142
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:56,895
You hear that why

1143
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:01,759
Would you believe for a second Alex is sincere in his like

1144
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:06,623
Wow you don't really mean this is Davis for shock value or CDL is worse

1145
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:07,647
Like

1146
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:10,463
What yeah I mean it's the point

1147
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,487
Sometimes

1148
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:13,535
Sometimes I have to humble myself

1149
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,303
And

1150
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,399
I have to say thank you to people that I wouldn't otherwise so I do want to thank Nick

1151
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:23,007
Because the only reason I am not in jail right now is that he is never come anywhere near me

1152
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:24,799
Probably has

1153
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:26,591
If you haven't

1154
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:31,199
He's very we're both very lucky we're all very lucky people sitting here right now

1155
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:32,479
Because if you say that

1156
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,015
I wouldn't say it

1157
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:36,063
I wouldn't say

1158
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:38,111
My voice again it's again

1159
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,903
The kind of thing

1160
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:40,671
That when

1161
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,695
One says it

1162
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:42,719
Words

1163
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,999
Are not going to hell

1164
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:49,119
This is not 23-year extorting Jewish people because you're

1165
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:50,655
Threatening a holocaust

1166
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:54,751
This isn't something that you argue you can argue somebody out

1167
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:58,335
Maybe if they get to a point

1168
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:00,383
Where they can recognize

1169
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:02,943
The awfulness

1170
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:03,711
And

1171
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:05,503
Like what they're actually in

1172
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:08,831
And be like oh I should probably try and change

1173
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,367
I think there is

1174
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:13,183
Is there a possibility for people to change

1175
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:16,511
Recognize you know that kind of stuff but if you're arguing with Nick

1176
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:17,535
Like about

1177
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:19,071
If you hear somebody say this

1178
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:21,119
You're not going to win an argument

1179
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,911
You don't need to engage

1180
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:24,703
In-N-Out

1181
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:28,031
Stop that to me I don't understand why there would even be like

1182
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:29,567
What is it about

1183
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:30,847
This person

1184
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:31,871
Nick

1185
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,407
Alex Caesars

1186
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,175
Worth

1187
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,711
I trying to have

1188
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:37,503
Some sort of the conversation with

1189
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:39,039
You have to ask that question

1190
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,879
It's it's not a question that lead you anywhere other than

1191
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,415
Alex had the tacit

1192
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,183
Agreement

1193
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,463
Right with Nick about

1194
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,999
That right he won't

1195
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:52,607
He won't be as overt as Nick but they're on the same page

1196
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,887
What if

1197
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:54,655
And this

1198
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:59,263
This could just be because I grew up in a very cartoon heavy

1199
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,031
Era

1200
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:01,567
What if

1201
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,383
We hit him in the head with a frying

1202
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:09,503
Bugging out kebangsaan I'm not saying that it 100% works

1203
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,807
Here's the here's the problem

1204
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:16,927
Yeah you would have to prove that getting hit in the head with a frying pan made him anti-semitic in the first place

1205
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:19,487
Cuz then be hitting the frying pan could undo it

1206
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:20,255
Like

1207
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:28,959
Perhaps Alex accidentally hit him with a frying pan when he was a young child to Alex feels this personal guilt

1208
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:35,359
That's why you got him to show the boy put them on bed TV and I look forward to your cartoon

1209
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:38,431
More clearly established

1210
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:41,759
So Alex

1211
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:42,527
How's this

1212
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:45,855
Need to defend his own conspiracy world

1213
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:50,719
Because throughout this Nick is also not buying Alex's s***

1214
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:56,863
Play Alice's bring up like all the wa out for the world economic Forum there behind everything is forum

1215
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,959
Who goes to the Forum they're all controlled by Junior

1216
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:07,103
Alex's just getting busted all over the place with his own narratives not being able to stand up to someone

1217
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:07,871
Cool

1218
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:10,431
Knows them and doesn't buy it right

1219
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:12,991
Alex tries to defend it and it doesn't work

1220
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:15,295
Yeah you really I think smoke

1221
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:17,599
Do it earlier in the last hour where you said well

1222
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:21,951
Kind of side issues a Bill Gates the wef and

1223
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,487
You know this. But the

1224
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,279
We're over here with the Jews

1225
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:30,143
The wef and the big corporations the New World Order and Gigi ping

1226
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:35,775
Are mass murdering people are bringing tyranny and lockdowns in World IDs

1227
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:40,127
And controls and whether they're Chinese or whether they're German or Jewish

1228
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:42,687
I'm just opposing these tyrannical objectives

1229
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:44,223
I kind of want a big tits

1230
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,015
And I just think

1231
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:49,599
Dangerous

1232
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:50,879
Do then

1233
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:53,695
Sit there and just invoke all of this

1234
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:54,463
And say

1235
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:55,999
Jews are the

1236
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:58,303
Powerful Jewish Mafia

1237
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,839
Bases around the world

1238
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:00,863
Is that what you're saying

1239
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:02,911
Yes

1240
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:04,703
And I think they do

1241
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:08,031
I don't even think it's really disputed anymore after what happened to ye and that

1242
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,055
Did you played

1243
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,847
Would bring black from the ATL at

1244
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:13,663
Look at him I mean he was somebody who even in 2018

1245
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,687
4 years ago

1246
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:18,271
We're saying things that are regarded as Politically Incorrect and people

1247
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:21,087
Correct

1248
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,391
Nebulous

1249
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,159
Very specific

1250
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:28,255
He said like partisan conservative talking points in 18 and he was

1251
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,023
Just fine

1252
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:31,327
And he see one on Tucker Carlson and he

1253
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,095
He called out

1254
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:34,399
China and called out a lot of things he was just fine

1255
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:36,447
Then he switched up on the Jews

1256
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,727
He was banned from Fox

1257
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,519
He was banned from daily wire

1258
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:40,543
And you don't have to

1259
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:42,335
The whole list but we've all seen the

1260
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,615
Cascading effect of this

1261
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:44,895
Adidas Shell card app

1262
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:46,431
Chase Bank

1263
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,199
Rose

1264
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:49,759
Tens of millions of dollars

1265
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:52,319
You know I mean it's unbelievable if that doesn't prove it

1266
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:54,367
And then the ATL is going around now

1267
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:55,647
I do not respond

1268
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:57,695
After passing route a letter in Congress

1269
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,743
Demanding

1270
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:00,767
At 1 they're getting him

1271
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:01,535
Kicked off Twitter

1272
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:04,351
I don't know how much more clearer could be with Alex

1273
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:06,911
Looks like he reject out with his conception of the world

1274
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:07,679
He's Express

1275
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:11,263
Fundamentally different views of policies he'd like to enact

1276
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:14,335
90 subscribe to an ideology that Alex's audience

1277
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:16,127
Will be very susceptible to

1278
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:19,455
This is one of the most ill-advised interviews Alex's.

1279
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:23,039
Probably not as bad as gay but I think it's worse than Spencer Davis

1280
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:27,647
Also how much was it gay being left alone back in 2018

1281
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:31,231
Doesn't complain all the time about people getting him hospitalized because of

1282
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:32,511
Supporting Trump

1283
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:39,167
It seems like Nick is just selectively rewriting history in order to accommodate his anti-semitic conspiracy and also he was only

1284
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:43,007
Show me fine when he went on Tucker because they edited out all the stuff that

1285
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,055
Is not said

1286
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:51,455
That's bad right now I'm feeling like that story you told of the red card Yellowcard the kid who ate

1287
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:54,015
Like what is what do you think at

1288
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:56,319
Okay if you eat the yellow card

1289
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:59,647
I'm going to eat the red card on I have

1290
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:03,743
Yeah you know like if you ask me do sympathize with Hitler do find him

1291
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:10,143
Yes of course I'm going to eat the red card that's what I'm here for what do you do with Jews Run the World

1292
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:11,679
Going to eat the red car

1293
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:14,239
What do I have to do

1294
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:16,031
I'm trying to express to you

1295
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,055
That I mean this

1296
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:23,455
Play the clip of me laughing about it going 0 to 60 and that the Jews better be nice to me cuz

1297
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,991
There's worse stuff coming

1298
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,551
You do not get it

1299
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:33,951
You have all the information I gave you all the clues and I liked all there if this is an escape room

1300
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:34,975
Just a door

1301
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:39,839
Another narrative here and it surprisingly also falls

1302
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:42,911
But how do you square it up the Jews and Israel

1303
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:46,751
The most County in lockdown for the world after China

1304
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:49,567
Evan given the deadly shot and one of the highest death rates

1305
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,871
All-powerful

1306
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:54,943
Why is this biomedical tyranny targeting them doing that to them

1307
00:57:56,479 --> 00:58:01,343
I think that that's just a symptom of the elite I think that's a symptom of hubris I don't know

1308
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,623
Example that the facts

1309
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:06,463
To kill people or something I think that

1310
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:12,607
The covid-19 very complicated there's a lot of Journalism to be done there

1311
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:21,823
Centerpiece

1312
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:22,847
Israel

1313
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:26,687
The worst country for beginner the poison shot

1314
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:27,967
Your lock down to the SEC

1315
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:33,343
Even make any sense because if they were going around giving everybody the VAC

1316
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,623
Maxine and that's supposed

1317
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:35,903
To take out everybody

1318
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,439
What were the most vaccine

1319
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:39,487
And who's who's going to be remaining when there

1320
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:41,535
I think the shot is dead

1321
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,303
Play I didn't get back

1322
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,095
Vaccinated at all but I had the idea that

1323
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:46,399
That the Georgia guide

1324
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:48,447
Headstones are dictating global politics

1325
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:53,567
I think it's just ridiculous and I think it's one of these things that led by

1326
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:57,663
The founder of CNN put that up I mean they do believe in Illinois

1327
00:58:57,919 --> 00:59:00,223
Nick there is a larger de Papi

1328
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:04,575
Who funded Hitler and how they set him up

1329
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:05,855
And this powerful group

1330
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,487
Tumi

1331
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:12,767
That's what's going on

1332
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:20,703
Yeah I just don't know how convincing that as I think when you look at these raw demonstration for power like

1333
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:23,519
If Alex was paying any attention to Nick

1334
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:26,079
He wouldn't think that this was a great point to bring up now

1335
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:31,967
And it's pretty amazing to see how little respect Nick has her out his entire worldview yep he doesn't agree with Alex on

1336
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:36,575
Fundamental base level aspect of reality so without addressing that this conversation

1337
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:37,343
Convoluted

1338
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:44,255
Alex can convince make of anything because Nick is a reasonably smart person and he's not one of Alex's traft audience

1339
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:45,023
Its members

1340
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:51,423
Alex's flimsy distractions and nonsensical conspiracies work on his listeners because they're not really processing what he's

1341
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:52,703
Almost every

1342
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:55,263
Guess that he has on his a fellow con artist so they just

1343
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,543
Know how to play along

1344
00:59:57,055 --> 01:00:02,175
But don't care about pretending to agree with Alex a stupid s*** cuz he has his own agenda to advance

1345
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:07,551
So you have a rejection of a fundamental elements of Alex's World being voiced

1346
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:12,415
Comfortably and confidently on the show by someone Alex has complimented as smart repeatedly

1347
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:15,487
That's a problem and is why you see Alex

1348
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:18,559
Begin to interrupt Nick more at this point the interview

1349
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:22,399
When he hears I don't know how convincing that is Alex nuheat

1350
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,423
Couldn't let that sentence

1351
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:28,287
Discontinued because Nick is about to explain why Alex is ideas unconvincing and that is dangerous

1352
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:29,823
Alex's ideas

1353
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,103
Supposed to be

1354
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,663
Possible to disagree on because they're based on

1355
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:36,735
Discernment and documents and divine revelation

1356
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:42,367
If they continue down that path Alex would be unable to show his world to be real at all

1357
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:44,671
And you be forced to fall back on outburst

1358
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:45,439
Cynthia Patrick

1359
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:48,767
Which looks bad in comparison to Nick being calm

1360
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:51,583
Collected non-confrontational for the most part

1361
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,119
Yeah even keel

1362
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:56,191
I just don't think even those tricks would work

1363
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:57,983
I mean it's

1364
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:00,031
It is

1365
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,847
If you're if you're

1366
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,639
Going to get into a fight

1367
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:05,919
Alright

1368
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:07,711
Maybe

1369
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:10,271
You should try fighting with your bed

1370
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:11,039
Best sword

1371
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:12,063
You know

1372
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:15,135
Like an Alex is trying to

1373
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:17,183
Fights with

1374
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:20,511
Floppy little pool noodle

1375
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:21,279
Because

1376
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,303
I don't know what he's

1377
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:28,703
Even trying to do know he is got scream at this dude's face

1378
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:32,031
A head of steam in your autumn off every time and make

1379
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:33,055
Him run away

1380
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:35,871
But I think Alex knows that that's not going to work

1381
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:38,943
Keep on going big-hitting entire f******

1382
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:40,735
Trainwreck of the thing

1383
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:42,527
You've only got one sword

1384
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:45,599
You're flopping around with a pool noodle so you might as well bring a sword

1385
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,623
It's it's

1386
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:49,439
It's interesting because I don't know how much Alex does know this

1387
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,719
Because a lot of its

1388
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:54,303
Experience in those like online debates that do just

1389
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,095
Deteriorated to screaming at each other

1390
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:59,167
And it makes me wonder

1391
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:04,031
If Alex is aware of that and he would know that Nick and handle someone yelling at him and he doesn't care

1392
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,311
So

1393
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:09,151
I don't know it it maybe it's intuition but just like

1394
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:11,711
I don't I don't think Alex's is

1395
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:14,015
Matchup for the screaming at him

1396
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,807
Yeah but you know you again

1397
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:16,831
You're on home

1398
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:17,599
Court

1399
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:18,879
You can mute him

1400
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:21,439
You could you have control over all this

1401
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:23,999
You can make this kid look like a fuking idiot

1402
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:29,887
Unless Alex is afraid of losing some kind of an access to yay or possibly alienating

1403
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:30,911
Knicks audience

1404
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,703
Who are notoriously hostile

1405
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:33,471
Exactly

1406
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:35,519
Call Billy's going to go and do a fight

1407
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:37,055
With a pool noodle

1408
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:41,663
As a sort of sacrificial lamb almost the only way to win is not

1409
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:42,943
He does like that

1410
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:43,711
Quotes

1411
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:47,807
So Nick not only is going to disrespect Alex but I just like

1412
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:49,855
Your ideas are not convinced

1413
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:52,415
What is also going to make fun of his sales pitch

1414
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,583
Are brakes are at

1415
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:00,863
Mean

1416
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:07,007
So we had to go to break there

1417
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,311
The point you were making to break

1418
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,383
Yeah

1419
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:15,455
Between you and tumeric 95

1420
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,991
Teen killed in the stupid

1421
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:21,343
Hi.

1422
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:26,719
I'm somebody who

1423
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,999
Everybody knows me is like

1424
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:28,767
The Holocaust

1425
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:29,535
Austin IRA

1426
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:34,399
You know but that that's sort of why it when I'm Bill.

1427
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:35,935
Labeled categorize

1428
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:39,519
Won't you see that I'm so much more than just a holocaust denier

1429
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,799
What what disgust

1430
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:42,079
Give me about him so much

1431
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,103
Is

1432
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:43,871
This

1433
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:44,895
F******

1434
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:46,175
Camouflage

1435
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:47,711
Ambiguity with humor

1436
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:49,503
Cluck-U

1437
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:53,855
You're not actually funny and you f****** know it and the reason people like

1438
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:56,671
Is because when he says these funny things

1439
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:59,487
They know he's being honest about them

1440
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:05,887
There's a sincerity behind that honest or that that attempt at humor

1441
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:06,911
Will tan your voice

1442
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:07,935
That's it

1443
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:12,799
So Alex wants to

1444
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:14,847
Impress upon Nick

1445
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:15,871
That

1446
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:19,199
Judaism is not 21

1447
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:22,527
Nothing of multitude of people of

1448
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,807
Different opinions and

1449
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:26,623
Different backgrounds that are all contained within

1450
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:28,671
The collective of

1451
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,439
Of Jews

1452
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:31,487
I feel like this is going to go well

1453
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:32,255
So it doesn't

1454
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,535
I can't I mean

1455
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:37,119
You would have every reason to think it was

1456
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:39,679
This one turns out does not work

1457
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:42,239
SoJO like you're saying that his

1458
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:43,263
Acidic juice

1459
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:46,079
One of the biggest rooms instead of Jews

1460
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:49,407
Doesn't think Israel shity I'm going to eat the red card

1461
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,175
Is it

1462
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,455
So

1463
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:52,735
I think it's more complex

1464
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:54,015
Nicktoons what you're saying

1465
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:57,087
I agree with you that there are Jewish batch

1466
01:04:57,855 --> 01:05:03,999
The one thing that they're on the same page about is that they're all on team Jew

1467
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:05,023
Israel

1468
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,303
And they literally

1469
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:07,583
Unchristian

1470
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:09,119
And it's so tragic

1471
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:10,143
There's so many

1472
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:12,447
Christian song

1473
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,215
Iowa semites

1474
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:16,287
These are not the Jews the Old Testament

1475
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:18,335
Call Juice dad that I talked about

1476
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,615
It's on the yay interview

1477
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:21,151
They believe in the talmud

1478
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:27,551
So yeah it's a real myself but I do not number of people who have

1479
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:32,415
I've gotten reporting of spitting gun zero

1480
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,439
Of those those

1481
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:35,999
I mean seems Seems like a strange

1482
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:42,399
Now I could be wrong perhaps he's talking about when Saladin took over

1483
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:44,191
Could have been then

1484
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:49,567
I would have listened if I was in saladin's Army spend on some Christians

1485
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:55,967
I I think that you're sort of inside of the I'm about to get the card and so right

1486
01:05:56,223 --> 01:06:01,855
You can feel in the setup of of Alex's the way he's like weird

1487
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:04,415
Bucked up going to happen

1488
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,695
What are you doing

1489
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:06,463
Yeah

1490
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:07,487
Well

1491
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,535
You can say a lot of things about Al

1492
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:11,071
And we have and we will

1493
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:13,375
But one thing

1494
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:15,935
But you can't say about him is that he's interested in you.

1495
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:17,215
But

1496
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:18,751
You can say that

1497
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:22,847
He constantly pretends to be interested in you 100% you can say that

1498
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:23,615
Yeah

1499
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:26,175
You say the full thing about Bill Gates

1500
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:27,199
How did you know

1501
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:28,223
That's the central issue

1502
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:29,503
Should I see this hole

1503
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:32,319
Lester staying saying America

1504
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:33,599
Hitler and

1505
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:36,159
You know the left scripture Captain America

1506
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:37,951
That's what it is

1507
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,231
And

1508
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:41,023
I just hope

1509
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:42,815
All of us can come together and

1510
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:43,839
Transcend

1511
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:44,607
The castle

1512
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:46,143
Society in the world government

1513
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,167
Injection

1514
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:49,983
Trying to get everybody together

1515
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,007
On those issues

1516
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:52,799
Instead of

1517
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:53,567
Obsessing

1518
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,871
About different groups all day you know this whole group

1519
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:58,687
McKay's

1520
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:01,247
And I don't think the Jews run everything

1521
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:02,527
I mean who do you think Rodger

1522
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:03,295
China

1523
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:05,087
With a billion 500 million people

1524
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:07,903
I think the Chinese run China

1525
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:08,927
And I think that's why

1526
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:11,231
I mean there are problems in China but China

1527
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:12,767
Country that is fighting for its

1528
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:13,791
Fighting ruthless

1529
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:17,119
And you could say that it's at rannoch

1530
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:19,167
Allstate has always been a tyrannical

1531
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:20,703
I'll stay there different kind of society

1532
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:21,983
Hey there the Chinese people

1533
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:28,127
Are very collectivist they're very societally minded a very obedient and and deferential

1534
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:29,919
And that's their culture and that's who they are

1535
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:32,991
But there's no question that the Chinese standing committee

1536
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:35,807
And she's champagne are going out too bad every day to get

1537
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,343
They trade deals for China

1538
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,623
In a way that are are Jewish

1539
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:40,671
Leaders in America are not working for

1540
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:42,463
People in Oklahoma and Iowa

1541
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:44,767
Does anybody believe the Hollywood use in LA

1542
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:48,607
And finance used in New York in the government using d.c. in the ones in South

1543
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:49,631
South Florida

1544
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:51,935
Does anybody think they need daycare at all they give a

1545
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:53,215
Damn about people

1546
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:54,751
People and

1547
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:56,287
Kansas or people in Iowa

1548
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:57,311
They don't

1549
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,335
In the same way that

1550
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:01,663
You could say Putin or champagne care I think about there

1551
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:03,455
Ximena rasad hears about the

1552
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:04,479
Syria

1553
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:08,575
Alex was not expecting that answer

1554
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:10,879
Alex was expecting

1555
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:13,183
Nick to say that Jews run China

1556
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:16,511
Emma and Alex could argue with him about it but unfortunately

1557
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:17,535
Nick has a

1558
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:19,327
Different worldview

1559
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,607
AAA

1560
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:21,631
I mean

1561
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:22,911
Just pathetic

1562
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:24,191
Just f***

1563
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:27,263
You mean that Alex's display

1564
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:29,567
Ya-hoo tummala together

1565
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:30,591
That is

1566
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:31,615
So disgusting

1567
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:32,383
Yeah

1568
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:35,455
F*** you one that's not an answer from Nick

1569
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:38,015
That's that'll Lindbergh f******

1570
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:39,039
Stump speech

1571
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,319
Join Hitler

1572
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:44,927
I will say it is an answer and then.

1573
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:51,583
As much as who do you think runs China

1574
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:54,911
Deterioration to

1575
01:08:58,495 --> 01:09:01,055
Alex decides he's going to give a little bit of a rebuke

1576
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:04,639
You know who my favorite businessman was Henry Ford

1577
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:06,943
To let me tell you what what was that

1578
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:08,735
Ono Ono

1579
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:13,087
Describe is a pool noodle

1580
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:13,855
Of a rebuke

1581
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:15,647
That he gives

1582
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:16,415
To Nick

1583
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:20,767
Decided

1584
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:21,535
Discussion

1585
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,559
Here today

1586
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:23,839
And you know a person

1587
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:25,631
That everybody

1588
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,167
Black hole

1589
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:28,447
Giving power to it

1590
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:31,519
Manipulating

1591
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:33,823
Maybe a transom things on policy

1592
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:34,847
And ideas

1593
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:35,615
Issues

1594
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,895
And the fruits of the tree

1595
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:38,687
We're going to break here in a few minutes

1596
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:40,735
It's your chance unfiltered fog

1597
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:43,295
We don't screen the calls just have a good clean phone line

1598
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:45,343
Calling from and don't cuss

1599
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:47,391
So the rules don't cuss

1600
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:49,951
We're talking about

1601
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:53,279
Genocide and entire people we don't want to make it gross

1602
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:55,583
Spell show

1603
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:58,911
So how does whole thing was that you want to take a bunch of calls with Nick

1604
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:00,191
But that weird lady

1605
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:02,495
20 minutes left in the show at this point

1606
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:03,775
Baby hasn't dropped calls

1607
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:05,567
Before

1608
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:11,455
So this is about as close as Alex gets to condemning next views as the weakest position possible

1609
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:13,759
He has no actual criticism of what

1610
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,295
Nick is sad he just thinks

1611
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:16,063
But there's a black

1612
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:20,159
Cole the people get sucked into a mess with the Sinister forces I guess the globalist

1613
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:20,927
Twat

1614
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:23,487
This is boilerplate s*** and it means nothing

1615
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:29,119
Transenterix on policy ideas and actual issues

1616
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:32,703
None of that has happened on the show at all today

1617
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:37,311
Nick has been pretty clear about the policies you'd like to explore in this and other

1618
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,847
Appearances Beyond steel polish

1619
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:43,967
What's the first amendment wants to create federal laws regarding where Jews can and cannot work

1620
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:49,343
I am basing most of the government's decisions on a Ridgid fundamentalist interpretation of Christianity

1621
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:53,951
Actually wanted to transcend things whatever that means in the realm of policy

1622
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:55,231
You could have started there

1623
01:10:55,743 --> 01:11:01,887
Defeat makes desire to ban pornography and even sexy images in the battlefield of ideas by explaining house that attack on

1624
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:05,983
Threatens a wide variety of other forms of speech and expression

1625
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:08,031
It's the simplest thing in the world

1626
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:10,079
It's Alex's Marquis issue

1627
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:13,151
And instead of even taking that much of a risk

1628
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:15,199
I was just mopes around building

1629
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:17,247
Defenses for the horrible s*** Nick says

1630
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:20,575
Then I'm using the First Amendment as a shield for why he and Nick should

1631
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:22,367
Be criticized for having this conversation

1632
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:23,647
It's cowards

1633
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:24,415
Even

1634
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:27,231
You entirely buying into Alex's worldview

1635
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:30,559
If you're a listener of the show and you believe all of it

1636
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:35,679
You should be watching this interview and questioning whether or not Alex is the champion he pretends to be because

1637
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:40,799
He seems like a loser little titty baby you honestly it's very very sad

1638
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:42,847
That's the thing I mean I

1639
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:45,151
In my head you know the argument

1640
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:46,175
Could be

1641
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,967
You know you don't want to piss off Nick

1642
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:50,271
Because it'll alienate his

1643
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,039
White National

1644
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:54,111
That's the fear or they'll attack you

1645
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:55,135
You or something like that

1646
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:56,671
In my mind

1647
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:58,463
If I'm Alex

1648
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:01,279
Here's the only thing I have control over

1649
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:04,095
I have control over my show

1650
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:05,119
You know

1651
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:07,167
Yeah and I've got

1652
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:09,215
To dominate this kid

1653
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:12,287
Because I'm more afraid of people not listening to me

1654
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:14,335
Because I got my ass beaten by a 12-year

1655
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:15,615
Well I think

1656
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:17,151
It's too late

1657
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:23,039
That is definitely true this point certainly in the show where they're at it is too late

1658
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:23,807
Perhaps

1659
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:27,647
He said there was something about jewishness that makes these people bad

1660
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:28,927
Or when he

1661
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:33,791
Since the Jewish question control over your own shop

1662
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:37,119
When you're like all right

1663
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:37,887
Well

1664
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:41,727
First Amendment does allow you to say these things because the government is interesting you

1665
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,287
So I'm going to make a decision

1666
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:46,591
About the kind of content that I am

1667
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:49,151
Willing to put on MySpace

1668
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:51,967
Skip that I have control over here and get the f*** out

1669
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:54,271
But I wouldn't do that because

1670
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,039
Some reason

1671
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:58,367
And their stupid conversation boils down to

1672
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:00,671
Him being like I think it's juice hookah

1673
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:03,743
Control our country and Alex been like that stupid

1674
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:10,655
Shadowy group of people is convincing you to talk about it being juices the problem

1675
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:11,679
A group of people

1676
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:13,215
It's what are you

1677
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:14,495
Again

1678
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:17,823
You know it's so painfully obvious

1679
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:18,591
If you look at the

1680
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:19,359
These things

1681
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:22,175
That the yay interview was Alex

1682
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:24,223
Desperately being like use code

1683
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:24,991
Just

1684
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:30,111
We can make so much money use code is going to be great I bought a money printing machine

1685
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:31,135
Yeah and

1686
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:32,159
When he's talking to

1687
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:33,439
It's the same thing

1688
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,463
It's just

1689
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:35,743
Use that code

1690
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:36,767
Come on buddy

1691
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:43,423
Shadowy group I mean he might as well go for blood typing a sign that says shadowy group okay

1692
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:44,447
Jesus

1693
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:46,239
So Alex tries to sum up his point

1694
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:48,799
Pierre and

1695
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:52,895
Let me just make my point here on that I'm basically done debating and arguing all this

1696
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:55,455
I don't judge Nick

1697
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:56,223
Coin toss

1698
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:57,247
You know I just

1699
01:13:58,527 --> 01:13:59,551
Are some issues here

1700
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:01,855
Because you can't have the left

1701
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:02,623
Vicious

1702
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:04,415
Sing

1703
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:05,951
People are inherently the devil I have

1704
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:10,303
Where major universities in Michigan California New York

1705
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:12,607
White people wear badges

1706
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:16,191
Digitally track them and don't let them go in certain areas

1707
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:17,471
And who's running then

1708
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:19,007
Batl

1709
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:22,847
CDL after last three conferences said I'm the number-one enemy

1710
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:24,127
We track the lawsuit

1711
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:25,663
Everything

1712
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:27,967
I'm not going to blame the average Jude

1713
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:30,015
He's doing to me and my fam

1714
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:35,903
In the process of trying to sum up his point Alex uses

1715
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:38,975
Fake stories to exaggerate the oppression of white people

1716
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:41,791
In order to make Nick's ideology not look so it's

1717
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:42,559
Extreme

1718
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:48,959
This is him pretending to pose neck but doing everything in his power to make Nick's argument for him or at least

1719
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:50,751
Make it more palatable to the audience

1720
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:52,543
Now listen I know it

1721
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:56,383
It sounds crazy for Nick to want a genocide people but

1722
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:59,967
The ATL wants to genocide people so it seems like next a great guy

1723
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,807
That whole thing about why people wearing badges I think

1724
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:09,439
It was from a 2022 midterm election attack on Wisconsin governor Tony Evers

1725
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:15,839
Evers that worked as the superintendent of the Department of Public Instruction between 2009 and 2019

1726
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:22,495
At some point during that span the DP I worked with a group called Volunteers in Service to America or Vista

1727
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:27,359
In 2013 Vista handed out a document titled addressing racial privilege

1728
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:29,407
A mental model for white and erasers

1729
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:31,199
Which included a section

1730
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:32,223
That Addison

1731
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:36,575
Suggestion of wearing the white wristband that you can use as a conversation starter

1732
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:39,647
How about your commitment to equality and acknowledgement of white privilege

1733
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:41,439
I believe that

1734
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:44,511
The story that's at the root of this okay

1735
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:49,887
Complain about it before things like you might have exaggerated that story out a little bit to be a counterweight

1736
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,423
Now but

1737
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:53,215
You're forgetting that

1738
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:57,311
The Livestrong bracelets wear a shadowy plot

1739
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:58,079
Turu

1740
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:00,639
Kill people who are either

1741
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:01,407
Bell or

1742
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:02,943
Sword not good at bike

1743
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:03,711
Yeah

1744
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:09,343
Truth and it's exciting to hear that Alex has traced all the lawsuits back to the ATL

1745
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:15,743
I thought it was Hillary Clinton's Law Firm that was behind it all

1746
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:18,303
Supporting Trump

1747
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:24,703
Ipower hovercraft on any given day

1748
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:26,495
Does seem very malleable

1749
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:32,127
Pretty bad the rotating cast of characters taking over

1750
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:36,735
Jeff from 8 to 12 you know we're repressing Alex you know it smart

1751
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:37,759
So what is it saying

1752
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:40,831
We was a roadblock

1753
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:47,231
In terms of our initial attempt to record this episode I realize that

1754
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:49,023
Was the incessant

1755
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:50,815
Alex

1756
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:56,191
Pointing to like the abl being bad in order to make a NIC not look as bad

1757
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:59,007
Most of what

1758
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:01,567
His defenses and his argument

1759
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:03,103
Surrounding this is like

1760
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:05,919
How can I be mad at Nick when the ATL is so bad

1761
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:08,735
That is really what was bogging us down

1762
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:15,135
We are was I was convinced we were beating the dead horse that's not true Alex was the one who is constantly out

1763
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:17,695
It was so repetitious

1764
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:22,303
Interfered with our ability to

1765
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:25,887
So you're so racist we couldn't

1766
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:32,287
Record the show the first time

1767
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:33,055
That it was

1768
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:35,871
Boring to the point where I

1769
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:37,151
Felt like we were walking

1770
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:39,199
Through like knee-deep molasses

1771
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:43,295
Seat hearing this defensive Nick over and over again

1772
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:46,111
Hey look if we have to do a post-mortem on this

1773
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:48,927
At the end of the day some of that might come down to my fault

1774
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:50,207
For when I was cutting clips

1775
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:52,255
Maybe I had too many of those

1776
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:54,559
You know well listen

1777
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:55,583
You get this one

1778
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:01,215
So Alex expresses his opposition to Nazi

1779
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:04,031
And again I mean the end on what grounds

1780
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:05,055
Personal one

1781
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:05,823
That's what I was

1782
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:07,615
Hitler's for plan Society

1783
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:09,151
I oppose that be

1784
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:10,175
Because it is a

1785
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:12,479
Obvious eugenics

1786
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:14,271
Operation and I'm an expert on it

1787
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:15,551
I know all about it

1788
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,087
Mystery box

1789
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:22,463
It's amazing

1790
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:23,487
But

1791
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:24,255
Again

1792
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:25,279
Dallas

1793
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:27,583
One side of my grandfather

1794
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:28,863
Bolt action

1795
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:30,911
The other side the Hammonds

1796
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:34,751
And they were

1797
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:35,775
Module

1798
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:37,055
Blonde hair blue eyes

1799
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:38,335
And

1800
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:40,127
They were in World War II

1801
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:41,407
And they know what went on

1802
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:43,199
And they told me now Hitler was bad

1803
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:46,271
And I told me what went on how the rich Germans in Dallas

1804
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:47,295
What's Hitler.

1805
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:48,831
In the power and 33

1806
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:50,367
They would blackmail German

1807
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:53,951
My grandfather worked with

1808
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:57,279
Can't were doing that

1809
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:00,863
My family told me went on

1810
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:02,655
So I grew up

1811
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:03,423
Actually

1812
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,727
Hearing about all of that then my grandfather

1813
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:07,263
Work and seek

1814
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:08,799
Programs

1815
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:13,151
And I only heard a little bit of it that my mom heard and talk about he never talked about it

1816
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:15,967
You're sold about

1817
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:17,503
Weapons projects

1818
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:19,551
Now here he knew he wouldn't

1819
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,111
And how

1820
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:25,695
He had to deal with these damn Nazis and arrogant they were and I didn't like them

1821
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:26,975
Show me I grew up

1822
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:28,767
Both grandfathers

1823
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:30,303
Both

1824
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:32,863
And they both didn't like

1825
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:34,399
And so

1826
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:37,727
I didn't get from Captain America and get it from Hollywood and get it from any of that

1827
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:39,263
Another for my badass

1828
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:45,919
And they don't make men like that anymore so

1829
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:46,943
That's where I'm at

1830
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:50,783
I can I can

1831
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:53,855
This is a personal story

1832
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:55,135
Event is like

1833
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:56,671
I don't give a s*** like

1834
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:57,951
I don't think that this

1835
01:19:58,207 --> 01:20:04,351
Anecdotal story means much in terms of like why you oppose Nazis

1836
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:06,911
Like one grandfather was annoyed by them

1837
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:09,727
And then the other one heard something about extortion

1838
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:13,055
Also one side of his family sounds like they were Nazis

1839
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:14,336
100%

1840
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:16,384
Crazy German

1841
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,920
Came here recently

1842
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:23,552
It seems to be ome said they were in World War II

1843
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:28,160
It seems to me that all of those things are Alex adding up

1844
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:32,000
2 they were not hurt those are that's

1845
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:33,280
That's the type of

1846
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:34,048
Lineage

1847
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:38,400
Tracks with Alex's bike

1848
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:41,472
I've not told this whole story

1849
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:47,872
And is it I mean you know on the other hand he's not quite telling it like a Romeo and Juliet you know like my tooth

1850
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:54,272
My grandfathers were both at war with each other you had

1851
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:57,088
Lineage and then the Confederate lady a

1852
01:20:57,344 --> 01:21:02,976
I'm that baby boy is not America opposite of you got chocolate in my peanut butter

1853
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:05,536
Is it is 100%

1854
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:11,168
Slave owners in genocidaires are like we do the same job this is such a smart thing we do

1855
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:15,776
We are making a bit of an assumption but it is assumption based on a lot of

1856
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:18,080
Details that Alex was very

1857
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:24,992
So he knew a lot of Rich Germans in the area at

1858
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:26,784
Time Hitler took over

1859
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:28,064
So

1860
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,088
I think

1861
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:30,368
I think that

1862
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:35,488
Especially if you're expecting to enter a conversation

1863
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:38,048
With a guy who you clearly know

1864
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:39,584
Loves Hitler and

1865
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:40,864
Basically has

1866
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,144
Neo-Nazi ideas

1867
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:43,424
I think

1868
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:47,520
You should be able to articulate your opposition to

1869
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:48,288
Hitler

1870
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,080
And the Third Reich

1871
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:52,128
Better than saying

1872
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:55,200
Wernher von Braun and his buddies were arrogant

1873
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:57,504
And

1874
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,040
Nazis extorted people

1875
01:21:59,296 --> 01:21:59,808
I think

1876
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:00,576
This

1877
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:01,856
Is soft

1878
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:03,648
Possibly attend

1879
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:05,184
Channel 8

1880
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:08,512
He said this exact thing in the AM interview

1881
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:09,280
Like

1882
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:10,304
Nick is already hurt

1883
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:13,632
This is means nothing Alice's remember he doesn't care

1884
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:19,008
I mean listen here's the thing that's unspoken that is in Fury

1885
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,544
Right because

1886
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:24,896
What's going on here is the World War 2 Hitler conversation in the canto

1887
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:26,944
Text those of the Holocaust and all that stuff

1888
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:27,712
And

1889
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:30,016
Yeah Alex

1890
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:32,064
His defense is horrendously Garba

1891
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:35,904
I feel like even if you are an anti-semite

1892
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:37,952
Shouldn't you be able to agree

1893
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:40,512
Bet flattening France is a bad idea

1894
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:44,096
That should be held against someone that's interesting

1895
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:47,936
Hold that against him I think that's an interesting point

1896
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:53,312
But I'm the reason that they don't mention that it's because they're fine with expansion of government flattening people that they don't like

1897
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:54,592
Probably

1898
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:56,128
But I think that Alex bring

1899
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:56,896
Brings this up

1900
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:57,664
Because

1901
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,432
To him

1902
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:00,480
Subjective experience

1903
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:04,832
Is so much more important is anecdotal story

1904
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:07,904
And stuff that is much more reality to him

1905
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:08,928
Then

1906
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:12,000
Something that happened to somebody who he doesn't know

1907
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:14,560
Or they're the broader picture of the

1908
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:20,960
Atrocities in horrors of World War II dealing with two narcissist 17/20 is bulshit earlier about

1909
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:26,848
I don't care what happened in the past ATL is affected my life like 10 and 2

1910
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:27,616
Who cares

1911
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:30,176
Your life is meaningless you shitbag

1912
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:31,712
But

1913
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:38,368
Keep saying it

1914
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:39,136
What

1915
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:40,160
He thinks better of it

1916
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:46,048
Okay but then you thinks better of the thinking better of it

1917
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:47,328
This is basically Alex

1918
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:48,864
Ping pong game with himself

1919
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:51,168
I'm at but that said you can't

1920
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:54,240
Schlotzsky's in the dryer he's been spun around so many times

1921
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:55,008
When the left

1922
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:56,288
Is literally

1923
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:00,640
Redlining the engine when it comes to race-based politics in the ATL is

1924
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:01,408
Captaining

1925
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,224
Teaching elementary students they're inherently bad

1926
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:04,992
Because of what

1927
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:08,064
I'm not going to

1928
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:09,856
Reliable the ATL

1929
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:11,136
What I say

1930
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:12,416
Mess around find out

1931
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,720
Earlier using

1932
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:19,328
The support for what ye said

1933
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:21,120
What's 50/50

1934
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:22,912
I wanted to

1935
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:23,680
Demarcated

1936
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:24,448
The fact that I'm up

1937
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:28,032
What's

1938
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:29,312
He said I don't agree with

1939
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:31,104
And what's happened to him

1940
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:33,920
But I'm not in League with that whole worldview so that's where I'm at

1941
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:40,320
That's convoluted with where you're at if you're listening to this

1942
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:42,368
To be pretty tough to get a sense of like

1943
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:43,648
What that means

1944
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:50,304
I would like rather than going on the journey to find out where Alex is at I would like him to tell me where he's at and then

1945
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,072
The show is work at

1946
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:53,120
If you must know he's never going to do that out

1947
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:59,776
Sushi is saying that you can't judge Nick because the ATL is so anti-white and they're teaching

1948
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:02,848
White kids that are bad because of that

1949
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:06,176
Alex doesn't want to do what Nick is doing

1950
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:07,456
Because he doesn't want to sync

1951
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:08,992
To the level of ATL

1952
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:10,784
But also

1953
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:12,832
F*** around and find out

1954
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:17,440
Like Nick said in a clip that Alex played for All America first

1955
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:19,744
At Dave's June should be

1956
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,560
Stu us because there's worse people coming

1957
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:28,704
So that's that's what Alex is hearkening to the right and as a little bit of a cherry on top he says

1958
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:29,984
The support for gays

1959
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:30,752
These comments

1960
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:31,776
We're 50/50

1961
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:33,568
Which is to say

1962
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,360
Half of my audience

1963
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:39,456
My audience is not

1964
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:45,600
Those worst people that are coming

1965
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:48,416
If you're not nice enough to Nick and gay

1966
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,184
80s

1967
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:50,720
It is so f******

1968
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:52,000
Unreal

1969
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:53,280
It is uncanny

1970
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:54,816
Candy

1971
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:58,912
Because I think of these people and I see them wearing the skin of a human

1972
01:25:59,168 --> 01:25:59,936
At all of those

1973
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:00,960
Thanks right when they

1974
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:01,984
Talk to each other

1975
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:03,520
This this

1976
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:05,056
A lack of mirror

1977
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:06,592
This idea of like

1978
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:12,992
Well obviously the 80 I was leaving so much racism and it's like you just heard a guy say the Jewish question to your face

1979
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:14,784
Your goddamn mind

1980
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:20,928
What is going on in your brain so it probably comes back to that subjectivity thing to though like

1981
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,488
Going up there is an inability to

1982
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,792
Probably process that like the things

1983
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:27,584
That you're involved in our

1984
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:31,936
Look as bad or worse than the things you're accusing

1985
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:32,960
That's the thing

1986
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:34,752
To me that is soaked

1987
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:37,056
Confusing about navigating life

1988
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:37,824
Is like

1989
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:39,360
I don't know

1990
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:42,688
What it is that you are if you can't do that

1991
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:47,296
Cuz I died and that doesn't mean that I think I'm some sort of more human or

1992
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:53,696
Or they're not human or anything like that right I am in this context because what I think of is a person who can do

1993
01:26:53,952 --> 01:27:00,096
You know another thing to that kind of muddies the waters even more

1994
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:01,632
Is that this is

1995
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:05,984
Providence purpose is a conversation between two people but it's also perform

1996
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:08,544
They're being recorded

1997
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,824
It's also

1998
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:11,616
Alex

1999
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:13,152
Doing his show

2000
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:16,992
I am kind of not trying any harder than he normally does

2001
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,064
Being pretty over

2002
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,880
And comfortable in his own position in a way

2003
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:23,904
He hasn't been

2004
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:29,280
On Alex's show the past there is a persuasive element that Nick is bringing to it that Alex

2005
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:32,352
But he is also bringing to it that he is not

2006
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:33,888
I am in that kind of

2007
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:35,936
That can kind of

2008
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,520
Add a little bit of another variable to a

2009
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:40,800
Where you accuse

2010
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:44,128
These people of being like others of the most horribly racist thing in the world

2011
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:46,944
I'm not acknowledge the things that that isn't

2012
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:48,480
That is the conversation

2013
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:49,760
Alex and Nick are having

2014
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:50,528
Because

2015
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:53,600
It's part of the performance conversation

2016
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:58,464
But yeah I think this is just been awful it's been very bad

2017
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,232
Nick sucks

2018
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:02,048
He has gone

2019
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:05,120
Azfar possibly further than

2020
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:07,424
Yeah he did on his interview

2021
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:09,984
Now I think maybe the only saving grace

2022
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:13,056
If you want even call it that is

2023
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:15,360
Look at how little attention this

2024
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:20,224
You know there is something to be said for how much this is

2025
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,016
Demonstrable evidence

2026
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:25,344
Of how much Nick Museum

2027
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,624
2

2028
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:30,720
Penetrate in any way into outside

2029
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:31,744
Market

2030
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,096
You probably didn't even know that this happened until we started recording no clue

2031
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:39,168
I think a lot of people didn't and I can say for sure

2032
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:41,216
Based on the number of tweets

2033
01:28:41,472 --> 01:28:42,240
That died

2034
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:44,288
Come and it was

2035
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:45,056
Flood

2036
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:47,616
When ye was on a couple

2037
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:49,664
Right when this happened so

2038
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:52,992
I think that there is something that is like

2039
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,040
This is dangerous this is

2040
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:56,320
Is f****** awful its death

2041
01:28:56,576 --> 01:28:58,368
Finally going to have an effect on Alex's audio

2042
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:01,696
And there is a real danger of

2043
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:03,744
I am swaying some of them over

2044
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,024
Yeah but

2045
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:08,352
In terms of this having the same

2046
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:09,376
Kind of

2047
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:10,400
Broad

2048
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:12,704
The fact that gay being on had

2049
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:13,984
It's laugh

2050
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:15,264
Yes it's less

2051
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:17,824
Now

2052
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,616
Intervallic protecting his body

2053
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:21,408
He's not doing a good job

2054
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:22,944
It actually is doing a bad job

2055
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:29,344
Commercial free podcast on Saturday

2056
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:32,928

Rosie. TV / Nick

2060
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:39,840
Yeah I'd love to

2061
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:42,144
Don't be afraid

2064
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:48,032
Don't be afraid of the info

2065
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:50,080
What the fuk just happened

2066
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:53,664
Funneling is audience to Tunica

2067
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:54,944
Bob Sight

2068
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:58,528
I mean Alex just invited him to talk more

2069
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:01,344
Does Alex not know that he just got spanked

2070
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:05,952
You might be in denial about it that's crazy

2071
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:06,976
That's crazy

2072
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:10,560
That is it safe

2073
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:13,632
If you're describing it as a spanking it's a sort of

2074
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:16,448
Assisted speaking events

2075
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:19,520
Alex if you wanted to

2076
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:21,568
Could have had far

2077
01:30:21,824 --> 01:30:22,336
More

2078
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:23,872
Robust pushback

2079
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:25,152
Oh yeah he could have had

2080
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:26,944
Any number of ideas

2081
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:30,272
4 things to say to Nick other than

2082
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:31,040
Well

2083
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:34,368
The ADL is really bad so

2084
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:39,232
You may be on his bed hey have you ever considered that maybe

2085
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:41,792
It's not juuzou maybe it's globalist

2086
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:43,840
These are just like

2087
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:46,912
The best he can do

2088
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:48,704
100%

2089
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,240
99

2090
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,800
What what the point is

2091
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:58,688
You can't it I mean and I'm not talking about spanking the debate like the ideas were but whatever

2092
01:30:58,944 --> 01:30:59,456
They're not

2093
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:01,248
What I'm talking about is

2094
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:02,528
The debate has

2095
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:04,320
And Nick

2096
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:06,368
Clearly has nothing to be afraid of

2097
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:08,160
Nobody can hurt him

2098
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:09,952
From his little screen

2099
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:13,024
Alex is clearly afraid of

2100
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,048
Tons of s***

2101
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:15,072
And it's

2102
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:16,352
Palpable

2103
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:17,632
That's that's what

2104
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:18,400
He got spanked

2105
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:21,472
Yeah he is not the he's not certain

2106
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:24,800
He's not like this is how it is like maybe you could be

2107
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:25,824
Listen up

2108
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:28,896
Jerk exactly exactly

2109
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:29,664
Listen up

2110
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:32,224
You have this worldview

2111
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:34,272
And I understand where you're coming from

2112
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:40,928
You're 23 Creek shut the f****** because what you're doing is actually damaging to the cause

2113
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:43,744
You need to understand

2114
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,024
Know Your Role

2115
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:51,424
Shut the fuk up

2116
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:55,008
The fact that he doesn't behave that way it is

2117
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,032
Sad

2118
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,616
Becoming a that's that's

2119
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:04,224
That's what would make me leave Alex in my head of what in Alex listener is obvious

2120
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:08,320
They wouldn't let me has nothing to do with that bright but he might head if I'm

2121
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:10,112
Alex Jones Infowars fan

2122
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:11,136
One of the

2123
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:12,672
Big things that I'm a fan of

2124
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:19,072
Is that this loud angry man is right all the time he's giving it to him the way that it needs to be given

2125
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:20,608
Piers Morgan

2126
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:23,168
And talk about it for the next decade

2127
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:27,520
Not really

2128
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:28,800
Take a few calls

2129
01:32:29,568 --> 01:32:30,080
And

2130
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:31,616
One of them

2131
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:33,408
Is a real bummer

2132
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:38,528
My daughter

2133
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,064
10 year old girl

2134
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:42,880
She was sitting there listening to this conversation

2135
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:45,440
And people need to realize

2136
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:48,000
People like you Nick

2137
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:49,792
Having influence over younger people

2138
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:51,584
Very careful with her

2139
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:53,888
Extremely careful

2140
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:54,656
We don't realize

2141
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:56,192
Don't you have

2142
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:58,752
Honestly

2143
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,824
Do what you want to but I

2144
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:07,968
Before you make any more comments

2145
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:08,992
Extra tall

2146
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:12,064
Nick is super aware of his influence

2147
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:18,464
Tricking kids into thinking extremism in 87 summer cool is legitimately the Cornerstone of his marketing strategy

2148
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:20,512
How Will I

2149
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:22,048
It got going for him

2150
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:26,400
Like he was being radicalized by weirdo Nazis pretended to be teens on 4chan in now

2151
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:28,960
Nick is trying to take that game and GoPro

2152
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:31,264
This color so f****** said 41

2153
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:34,080
Letting his fourteen-year-old daughter listen to this

2154
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:40,480
Nick wouldn't hear a warning about the influence he has on kids as an amazing compliment

2155
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:43,552
Play I did it almost

2156
01:33:43,808 --> 01:33:45,600
Feel him laughing

2157
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:47,136
That's absurd

2158
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:49,440
What that's that's such a great

2159
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:50,208
Little

2160
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:52,256
Bad bad thing to try

2161
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:54,304
You know what I'll do

2162
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,840
I think I can talk him down by

2163
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:56,608
I tell him about the

2164
01:33:57,376 --> 01:34:03,520
You got to read it twice that's good word my friend you got a lot of mixed up ideas that this good old book and saw

2165
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:07,872
You know what is kind of like a real

2166
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:08,896
Milquetoast

2167
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:13,248
Version of the shut up until you're older

2168
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:14,016
But it's

2169
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:15,040
It's

2170
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:16,064
Very very

2171
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:19,392
Black cooler than dancing

2172
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:23,232
Of the Bible kids come on down we got to youth group together

2173
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:26,048
So this next color is a fun

2174
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:28,608
Long and short of this is

2175
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:31,680
I think this guy is a Nazi supporter

2176
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:33,472
But also he insist

2177
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:36,800
Set Alex's German and Alex will not accept that

2178
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:38,080
Hey guys

2179
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:41,664
This dialogue

2180
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:42,688
That's my cuz

2181
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:45,504
Maybe this time

2182
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,040
Before you know the right

2183
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:48,576
Conservatives.

2184
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:49,600
Hitler in the left

2185
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:50,624
Always deflect

2186
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:51,392
Hitler

2187
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:53,952
I got to ask me

2188
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:56,768
Don't you agree that the

2189
01:34:57,792 --> 01:34:58,560
We're fighting for a better future

2190
01:34:58,816 --> 01:34:59,584
Future for all of Europe

2191
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:04,192
The tactics

2192
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:05,472
The war and Hitler

2193
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:09,568
You keep repeating that you're German don't you think that Europe will be in a better place now

2194
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:14,944
And Hitler got 20 million Germans

2195
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:17,760
Answer

2196
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:20,832
He is an American and a Christian

2197
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:25,696
Man

2198
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:32,096
Now we've got two races to disagree about their racism suddenly being accosted by a completely

2199
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:33,376
Different form of racism

2200
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:36,704
Racism Works guys and this this

2201
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:38,496
Color is weird weird

2202
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:40,800
Quite Place him

2203
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:46,944
But I do think that what he was expressing is that if Hitler had won World War two things would be better

2204
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:49,504
That seems to be the sort of

2205
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:51,552
Bullet point

2206
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:53,344
Also he's lovely

2207
01:35:57,952 --> 01:36:02,304
Well I mean I think that was also another subtle indicator is that that like

2208
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:05,120
No no no you said you had one grandfather's German

2209
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:05,888
Your German

2210
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,936
You're part of Zeller your parts of

2211
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:08,960
The fatter liar

2212
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:10,240
Sir

2213
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:11,520
Yep

2214
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:14,080
31 last clip here and

2215
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:15,872
Like these colors

2216
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:16,640
Suck

2217
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:23,040
Because there is legit pushback that a caller could make on what

2218
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:24,576
Nick is bringing to the table

2219
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:27,136
Within the conception of Infowars

2220
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:29,440
Go weird

2221
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:32,768
There are there outside of the Infowars

2222
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:33,536
Box

2223
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:36,096
There are potent criticisms that could be made

2224
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:37,888
Based on the things that makes a

2225
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:40,448
Call him out for saying the Jewish question thing

2226
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,496
Call him out for saying that to this

2227
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:44,544
Jewishness that makes people bad

2228
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,080
Any of these things could

2229
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:47,104
Be like what the

2230
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:48,384
F*** did you mean by that

2231
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:51,456
Family show don't swear

2232
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:52,736
But

2233
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:56,576
Get this guy saying hey think about the influence you have on kids

2234
01:36:56,832 --> 01:36:58,112
And read the Bible twice

2235
01:36:58,880 --> 01:36:59,904
We get this other guy who's

2236
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:01,696
Probably on Nick's side

2237
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:02,976
Quite frankly

2238
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:05,280
Hey nectresse

2239
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:06,304
Question for you

2240
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:09,120
These are all just words

2241
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:12,448
Why don't you start living in

2242
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:13,984
My question is like

2243
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:15,008
Why don't you

2244
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:17,312
Have to be a horse River why don't you

2245
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:19,616
Do Your Own Thing

2246
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:22,944
How much live in Christ

2247
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:26,528
More minutes of the day than probably any group out there

2248
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:27,552
Why don't

2249
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:28,320
Why don't you just

2250
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:30,112
Stop throwing bombs

2251
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:31,136
Start living

2252
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:31,904
Fight

2253
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:33,184
That's my question to you

2254
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:41,376
Well I I don't know what that means I'm not Amish so I don't think living in Christ means living in a low-tech society I'm living

2255
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:47,008
In price every day I'm a Christian I go to church I pray everyday I pray the rosary and what were called to do its

2256
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:50,080
We're call to go out and have Angela's until the

2257
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:51,872
Truth there's horrible iniquity

2258
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:52,896
And horrible and just

2259
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:53,920
Just going on in the world

2260
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:55,968
If you're Christian you have to be discussed

2261
01:37:56,736 --> 01:37:58,272
At the state of our country like I said though

2262
01:37:58,528 --> 01:38:01,088
The filth in the media the filth in our school system

2263
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:02,112
The groomers

2264
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:03,648
P*** the media

2265
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:08,256
It's terrible and it to sit by and watch all these innocent people and some kind of quietus

2266
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:09,280
Y'all people call this

2267
01:38:09,536 --> 01:38:10,304
The Benedict option

2268
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:14,912
I think it's a dereliction of Duty have an allegation of ours more calls

2269
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:18,496
I think that this

2270
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:19,264
Hey buddy

2271
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,544
Country Jamaica

2272
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,592
Bucking religious weirdo compound

2273
01:38:24,128 --> 01:38:24,896
I want to

2274
01:38:25,152 --> 01:38:26,944
I want to Kobe hugging Hamish

2275
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:28,736
I'm not Amish

2276
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:31,808
I don't know what you're doing sir event like

2277
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:33,344
They they are

2278
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,136
Christ more time

2279
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,952
It's such an it's such an

2280
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:38,720
Easy thing

2281
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:40,768
220

2282
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:42,560
Agree with their conception of what it means

2283
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:43,328
To be in Christ

2284
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:44,608
Oh

2285
01:38:44,864 --> 01:38:45,376
Okay

2286
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:46,912
Well

2287
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:49,472
Thanks thanks for taking my call

2288
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:51,520
It's such a

2289
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:52,288
The problem with

2290
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:53,312
I mean but that's

2291
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:54,592
That's how the religious

2292
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:57,408
Peer pressure always wind up working is

2293
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:02,528
Somebody like Nick comes in and then they're like hey you know what I don't think you really understand the Bible

2294
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:06,368
We need to learn about it that and then somebody like naked Power and they're like

2295
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:09,184
Nick says some interesting things I like listen

2296
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:10,208
Tunica

2297
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:12,512
I thought you knew about the Bible but I guess I don't

2298
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:17,632
Yeah I ain't no I disagree on a few things

2299
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:19,424
Yes that's some other things that

2300
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:20,192
You got to

2301
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:25,312
You got to listen to these other folks are saying some really bad

2302
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:28,896
Maybe the extreme stuff that he believes in art isn't really that extreme

2303
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:29,920
Man

2304
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:32,992
Aisha

2305
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:34,528
I hate this

2306
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:36,576
I don't want

2307
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:37,600
To just

2308
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:38,624
Cover this stuff

2309
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:39,392
But it's

2310
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:44,512
More or less the only thing that I find relevant about Alex's

2311
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:46,560
Present day

2312
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:47,584
Does feel that way

2313
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:49,376
I

2314
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:52,704
Ronnie just today Trump came out with those nipes

2315
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:55,520
I do wonder what Alexandra say about that

2316
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:56,800
But

2317
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:57,824
I hope

2318
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:01,152
This can move on to a different subject

2319
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:02,688
Soon

2320
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:03,712
Release

2321
01:40:05,248 --> 01:40:07,552
I'll tell you what I'll tell you what you know what

2322
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:11,904
When I next brand of Catholic fascism takes over

2323
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:13,440
I refuse

2324
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:14,976
To believe

2325
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:18,048
But that priest actually turns that Cracker into Jesus body

2326
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:22,912
I will die on

2327
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:24,704
Hang me from the Raptors

2328
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:31,104
If you think I'll ever say that the priest literally transforms of cracker into the skin of Jesus

2329
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:32,640
I'm not doing it

2330
01:40:32,896 --> 01:40:33,920
I'm not doing it

2331
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:39,296
Not once I think

2332
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:40,064
That

2333
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:41,600
This is

2334
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:43,648
A bad interview

2335
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:44,672
The bad debate

2336
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:46,976
Yeah Nick is escalating

2337
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:49,792
He's taking some of the things that were

2338
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:54,400
Part and parcel of the gay interview and reasserting them to Alex in a way

2339
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:55,680
That Alex is

2340
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:57,728
Impotent

2341
01:40:57,984 --> 01:40:59,776
Too much back on

2342
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:02,080
That we can't rule that out entirely

2343
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:03,104
Because of the end of

2344
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:09,504
Of all of it Alex's still like I want to talk to you for 2 hours I mean it, let's do this body I want to get more

2345
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:11,552
In the nick Fuentes business unreal

2346
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:13,344
But

2347
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:15,136
It was

2348
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:16,160
Watch

2349
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:17,952
More

2350
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:19,232
Monotonous

2351
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:21,536
Then I thought it was

2352
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:22,304
Listening

2353
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:26,656
I thought it was far more engaging and interesting that is really just a

2354
01:41:26,912 --> 01:41:28,192
It's kind of hitting the same notes

2355
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:34,592
82 batl is worse than you so hey maybe it's not so bad how can I criticize you went the eggs

2356
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:35,360
Exist

2357
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:38,176
That's the problem with the lesser of two evils

2358
01:41:38,432 --> 01:41:40,224
Always goes bad sooner or later

2359
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:46,624
And then the other thing is the trying to be like hey you were trying to be sincere

2360
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:49,696
Satonil in trying to piss off the sensors and

2361
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:55,328
Of all the time to give Nick excuses for him but he doesn't want

2362
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,120
In the same way that he was doing that with

2363
01:41:57,376 --> 01:41:58,144
With ye

2364
01:41:58,656 --> 01:42:00,960
End

2365
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:06,080
It does not Alex's a behavior does not make me confident

2366
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:08,128
That is going to be able to

2367
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:08,896
Navigate

2368
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:14,016
Be more choppy Waters that we're going to be getting into as we get closer to the 2024

2369
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:15,040
Election

2370
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:16,576
Whether or not

2371
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:18,368
Yay continues as a

2372
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:20,672
Quote-unquote candidate

2373
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:22,976
Even if even if he doesn't

2374
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:24,768
This isn't where this at

2375
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:25,792
No that's true

2376
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:29,376
This pageant that were in the middle of that is true

2377
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:30,656
And Alex

2378
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:32,960
Are you showing himself to not be able

2379
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:34,496
What the deal with chapter 1

2380
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:36,800
So as the book

2381
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:38,080
Progresses I imagine

2382
01:42:38,336 --> 01:42:38,848
It's going to get worse

2383
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:40,640
Feel like

2384
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:43,456
It's it's just so obvious

2385
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:44,736
When you watch

2386
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:47,296
Yay and Nick do these things with those

2387
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:48,064
Other people

2388
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:49,856
It's so obvious

2389
01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:53,184
That they're throwing a bomb in the idea of we always

2390
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:53,952
July

2391
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,024
By doing that

2392
01:42:57,536 --> 01:43:00,096
They're revealing that everybody's lying

2393
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:02,144
Like how does that not

2394
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:03,680
Thinking for people

2395
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:04,960
Well you know like you watch

2396
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:06,752
All of these people

2397
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:07,520
Reactivate

2398
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:08,800
Exact same way

2399
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:11,872
To this man saying the same thing over and over and over

2400
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:14,944
You know he means it 90mm

2401
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:18,784
Means it and you agree with him over and over and over again

2402
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:21,344
But you keep telling him to lie about it

2403
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:23,392
Yeah because you're a liar

2404
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:26,464
It does seem to I mean granted

2405
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:27,744
We should be clear

2406
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,816
We've only listen to the Gavin and Alex

2407
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:35,424
Appearances and Tim pool

2408
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:36,704
Wheatgrass

2409
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:43,104
Yeah that didn't get off the The Runway lucky he gets an incomplete on that

2410
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:44,896
Interviews that may or may not have

2411
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:48,736
Gone that way but turns of Gavin and Alex

2412
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:51,040
I agree with you yet that does reveal

2413
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:53,344
Yeah they're crypto nest

2414
01:43:53,856 --> 01:43:54,368
For sure

2415
01:43:56,928 --> 01:43:57,440
F*** all this

2416
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:05,632
Ava Jordan another episode. Until then

Redlobster.com

2418
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:15,872
Cubes

2419
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:18,176
Are juicy

2420
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:19,456
And now here comes

2421
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:20,480
What the sex robots

2422
01:44:20,992 --> 01:44:23,040
Holding
