1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Jordan

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for Dan and Jordan I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
Need need money

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,064
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Dot-com

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,696
Everybody welcome back tonight

7
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:02,720
I'm sure

8
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:06,304
A little bit about

9
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,328
Alex Jones

10
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,656
Indeed we are.

11
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,216
Quick question

12
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:19,616
Before anybody wants up today going here that was

13
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,408
There before we started recording

14
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,688
It was

15
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:29,088
Not there at all about two-and-a-half seconds ago and now I feel it this is a large credibly disorienting but

16
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,880
I will make the best of it

17
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,696
So my brakes today is not that we are recording

18
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,720
Remotely

19
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,536
Because I got a little bit of a sickness

20
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,888
I've come down with the bad case

21
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:46,752
I've left and you I will we know I don't know what it is but I

22
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,568
Would test and it's not that so

23
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:55,968
I don't know I still recording remotely because you know could be

24
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:02,368
Any number of different things is wiser now in this day and age to to be smart about things like that so you know sure

25
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,672
Sure I'm putting a hit the button

26
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:10,048
And the blast doors came down and I'm locked in

27
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:15,936
Before I felt

28
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,704
Fell ill

29
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:21,056
And that is that I was taking some couple bags

30
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,080
Buttons

31
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,384
Packages of buttons

32
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,176
Stuvi

33
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,456
Mailbox

34
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,480
Down the street

35
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,504
Because I can't

36
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,320
Just leave them in my my apartment there you wouldn't pick them up

37
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,648
So I expect the birds

38
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,928
To take them where they need to go

39
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:40,512
It would be nice if I had carrier pigeon who take me to Scotland

40
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:45,888
So I was on my way down there and I saw a mail truck

41
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,680
And so I walked up

42
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,704
To it and I asked

43
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,728
The guy like hey

44
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,032
I'm about to take these down to this mailbox

45
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,568
Or you can just take him from me

46
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,360
Is a golf course

47
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,688
Yeah it was just a little thing

48
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,992
But it was so nice he was evil

49
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,296
So positive this mail carrier

50
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,320
And like

51
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,112
I don't know it really bright

52
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,392
By my spirits

53
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:14,048
That's that's so cool because part of me honestly expect that response to that to be like no it's a

54
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:14,816
Illegal

55
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:18,400
Right right or there's a policy that I can't break

56
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,984
There's some reason where it's like I can't accept this by hand

57
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,384
There's ain't no God or any number of reasons we can't have definitive trail of custody or chain

58
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,152
Custody

59
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,200
Plastic go in the box at some point

60
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:32,992
Except

61
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:36,320
Yeah that was really cool I like that I appreciate that

62
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,600
That was great

63
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:45,536
My bright spot it's kind of like a it's kind of more like Twilight spots to some extent

64
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,120
Like a my bright spot is the World Cup

65
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,424
Final today

66
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,752
And it was a die I mean

67
00:03:55,008 --> 00:04:01,152
I couldn't do it justice to describe what happened with 10,000 words it's rev everybody's already describing is the greatest

68
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,688
World Cup final this ever

69
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,480
You know

70
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,504
Another

71
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:10,368
Whatever right I mean it's one of a really was astonishing to watch

72
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,464
It made me think of like the pyramids

73
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,536
Do you know what I mean because I mean like in Egypt in

74
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,839
Other countries me the game pyramid

75
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,119
The ancient pyramid

76
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,703
It's about how we still go see them

77
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:31,615
And what they are is really monuments to what you can build with slavery and blue

78
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:38,527
Cuz I actually heard from a guy that they were used to store grain

79
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,807
That's possible

80
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:47,743
I mean aliens have to keep the green somewhere and it was at the time

81
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:55,423
It is it is this world cup is one of the most amazing things I've ever seen and it's also a testament

82
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,983
Blood slavery so it's a terrible thing

83
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:02,847
Anime convention in soccer teams were built on blood and slavery

84
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,151
No but the arena was

85
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:10,015
The word placing forgot I forgot the guitar

86
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,807
Yeah yeah yeah

87
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,111
Guess he was

88
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:20,511
That's my other bright spot this Elon Musk guys doing some some great things that Twitter

89
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:26,911
That made me think of the pyramids what are these awful billionaires but the modern-day pharaohs

90
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,567
So fantastic

91
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:37,919
Today we have an episode to go over even though I have fallen ill

92
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,503
The DeMille

93
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,807
Podcast Mills

94
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,343
Can't be close just because

95
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:50,975
The foreman is closed or northfleet

96
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,815
Great I would take the day off but

97
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,839
That mailman

98
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:02,239
Really inspired me to no no no

99
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,287
Because my voicemail not hold out

100
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:07,615
We may have a little bit of a shorter episode today we're going to be back

101
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,919
In 2003 talking about December 8th

102
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,455
2003

103
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,479
Good idea

104
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:18,111
Even otherwise without that I still probably might have

105
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,159
Put Alex in his time out spot

106
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,207
For bad behavior

107
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,791
Even if it was I wasn't ill

108
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,583
But

109
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,191
A lot of calls

110
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,495
Iggy Azalea

111
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,519
Call Heather

112
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,103
Unfortunately I am

113
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,919
When I say that I would put him on timeout

114
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,199
It would work

115
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,759
Against me because of what ends up happening

116
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,783
And some of these calls

117
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:52,415
What is this the episode where common reveals he's an anti-semite

118
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:55,231
Unless common goes by

119
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,511
Greg

120
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:00,351
New Mexico wear whatever that I'm not sure

121
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,935
Beget release cuz I feel like it was right around this time

122
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,727
Was he on a promotional tour

123
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,775
I don't believe that,

124
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:11,871
Is backpack in the theater Infowars Studio

125
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,943
He at that these collars

126
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967
Terrible

127
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:22,367
Say hello to some new walks

128
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,647
Oh that's great idea

129
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:30,303
So first I set my goals but before I set my house on fire thank you so much and I'll probably walk

130
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,839
Very much

131
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:37,471
I blame Robert Evans

132
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,007
Thank you very much

133
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:45,407
Alex none of this is real Ambassador squatches 2nd paper podcast thank you so much you are now but was he walk

134
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,199
Thank you very much

Next

136
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,391
But thank you very much

137
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:02,303
And Kirby Rick's existentialism is a hoodie is a false flag also my 401k isn't doing so well

138
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,863
Late bro thank you so much

139
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,983
I know we got to take the trash to the mix Jordan so

140
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:16,127
This person told me to read this as the symbols exist

141
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,663
I think it's some kind of a coding

142
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,735
Joker I'm not entirely sure so maybe this is

143
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:25,087
Maybe the robots will find this real funny

144
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,623
Abso text

145
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,671
Lexa backs of this

146
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,207
Apostrophe

147
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:35,327
Close parentheses semicolon drop table technocrat

148
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,375
Semicolon Dash Dash

149
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:40,447
Thank you so much you are now a technocrat

150
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:46,847
Someone sodomites

151
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,343
I don't want

152
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,135
Jesus Christ

153
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,927
Thank you very much

154
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:05,023
Haha I hope that wasn't some sort of 8

155
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,399
Missile launch code or something that I have just let out

156
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,311
Start off and here's the vibe that Alex is putting out into the universe

157
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,895
It's a Monday mantissa Monday show

158
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,671
I've got a big fat week

159
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:42,399
That's whatever that's what I say whenever it's Monday huh

160
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:47,775
We're back in 2003 this is phat this is prime Phat time

161
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,847
So whatever people say was a big fat week you know what

162
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:54,431
I mean like in the it last year I would hear Alex

163
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:58,527
Constantly say that we have a thick with two C's in a week coming up

164
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,879
So

165
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,951
We we get to talking about some actual stuff

166
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,999
Pretty quickly

167
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,375
Pretty consistently throughout the show

168
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:17,727
As a testament to that here is our second clip

169
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,007
Is a collar

170
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,287
Already a call

171
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,567
Already you call her

172
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,895
Is a guy works in 1/4

173
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:31,295
And he claims I believe this actually probably true

174
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,367
He claims that he works with Chuck Norris

175
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:39,231
Where's Chuck Norris is like a deputized honorary police officer of some kind

176
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,303
Wait wait I thought that was Steven Seagal

177
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,095
Where they both

178
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:47,935
I think a lot of them might have dabbled in.

179
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,959
Wasn't Shack

180
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:55,359
Deputy sheriff honorary never thought this before but thank God

181
00:10:55,615 --> 00:11:01,759
Bruce Lee is dead so we didn't find out that he's a cop in New Orleans or so was later on rice for a while

182
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
That would be great

183
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:09,695
So anyway here's this caller talking about Chuck Norris and we learn something unfortunate about this color

184
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,231
I'm probably about Chuck Norris

185
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,535
One of my auction

186
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:16,863
Reserved for

187
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:18,911
One of my Oscar

188
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,263
Big

189
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,663
Videos by the way

190
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
And we were

191
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
We were

192
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,599
Beard Scout

193
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,415
Showing

194
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,055
Really really strong

195
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,615
I'm not at all

196
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,439
Yeah so Chuck Norris cat mentioned

197
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,999
Sherwood

198
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:23,167
Dimension the baby Jesus because of the Jewish influence on the media

199
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,191
Alex has a

200
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,775
Disappointing reaction to that color

201
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,639
Listening to visit like right out of the gate

202
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,943
F*** is going on

203
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,223
What are those

204
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:42,623
I know that even in like other periods of 2003 the we've got back to you there has been like undertones

205
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,159
Obviously there's

206
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,463
Conversation going on at

207
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,255
Check bigoted stuff of

208
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,535
Various tribes

209
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,303
But like

210
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,351
Going back in Japan

211
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,399
Here's overt

212
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,215
Some of these episodes

213
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,263
A right in your face

214
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,799
Yeah I mean

215
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:08,223
You know there's a part of it that makes me think one of the reasons that we're we're kind of unused to it right now

216
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:08,991
It's because

217
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:15,647
I guess 20 years ago they just didn't feel the need to speak it out loud to each other because

218
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,183
Was never under threat

219
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:22,047
You know now that people are paying attention to it then it's now it's time to start going

220
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,607
Absolutely crazy but it was always there

221
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:26,911
You know

222
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,679
Yeah

223
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:34,079
Yeah yeah it'll be more there as if it goes long to just call her is an ox

224
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,127
Emily let's say on this episode

225
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,479
Everybody we're going to be like

226
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:44,063
Okay well now we need to respect all peoples

227
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:50,975
So honest episode Alex does spend a fair amount of time talking about how great gold is due

228
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:54,047
Gold prices through the roof and what-have-you

229
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:59,167
I have been on other episodes in 2003 to that I've been listening to but he never mentions

230
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:02,239
That he works for Midas resources

231
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,519
Do they sell gold

232
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,799
He's not so weird

233
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:08,127
He's not doing the second stage of the gold sale thing

234
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,431
But it is so obvious

235
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,711
That he's selling gold

236
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,247
Is marketing gold

237
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:18,367
Right and then a big if true news story

238
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,647
Picacho

239
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:41,919
Gold

240
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,039
Yeah man

241
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:51,391
If you mention Jesus Christ you're going to you're going to get 6 months in jail

242
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:55,999
Pearson understand why saying if you bunch of Jesus Christ

243
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,815
Is war like emotionally-charged for people

244
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:03,935
If there was a law that was any word LEDs you 6 months in jail

245
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,263
I'd be furious about it right like it doesn't matter if it's Jesus Christ

246
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,311
Or like an

247
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,895
Is Angela to his six months of Jayla pizzerias to

248
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:19,551
Yeah I mean like I guess yelling fire in a crowded building if you lead to like people dying but like stampede

249
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,319
Good maybe

250
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,367
You could get a manslaughter

251
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,647
Charge or something

252
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:27,231
But like that's that's a pretty specific Circle

253
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:33,375
Takes a lot of other problems going on around you before that becomes the central one

254
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:38,751
Yeah maybe it is like a graduation speech they don't want you to just let give a sermon

255
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,567
Maybe it'll public school who don't necessarily

256
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,103
Let's not encourage

257
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,639
But no

258
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:48,991
By the way why is a judge giving like this press conference like

259
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,551
We will rock you up if you take tikosyn

260
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,879
Hernia silly

261
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,415
Okay he's locked up

262
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,463
Thirty or forty people already

263
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,791
For saying Jesus Christ and he's tired of it maybe people don't

264
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,351
Know about how you get locked up for saying it

265
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:08,191
Notice

266
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:12,031
Yeah yeah he just don't do it this is like a

267
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,567
Falling Rock sign

268
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,591
Yeah

269
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:20,735
So we get another caller and this person has a bit of a perspective that is like

270
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,783
Forced prayer in school

271
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,831
And if you don't like that

272
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,111
F*** out

273
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:30,719
Get out the country

274
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,999
Comment on it

275
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:35,327
Am I children where you and I'm grateful that they had a teacher

276
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,863
A small girl

277
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,079
Graham crackers

278
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,175
Sprite

279
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,223
Simply workout

280
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,271
Kristen Nurse & Lothrop

281
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,295
Leave

282
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,343
Measurement let us go on

283
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,879
Have a great day

284
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:06,047
Yeah man if you don't like her Tendencies towards theocracy and you don't like our indoctrination of

285
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:09,887
Of kids in public schools

286
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,911
Get the f*** out

287
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,191
Get out

288
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,751
All I'm saying

289
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:18,591
All I'm saying is that if there is a child from a different culture

290
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:24,479
They need to go to an American school have that culture torn from their bodies

291
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:29,343
Assimilate into whiteness and only white Christian theocracy

292
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:35,743
And then everything's going to be fine I feel like people are overreacting to my advice conversely they have another choice and it's good

293
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:44,959
Yeah so when we eat when we hear in the present-day you know again and talking a bit about like these

294
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:48,799
Tendencies towards Christian theocracy Christian nationalism

295
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:54,943
It is not a foreign conversation to the mentality of a lot of Infowars

296
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,479
Listeners even

297
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,247
Over

298
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,551
Like earlier time

299
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
Yeah

300
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,135
Yeah it makes you it makes you wonder like

301
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:06,975
Perhaps part of the reason that he's he's so willing

302
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,999
Throw those

303
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,023
Those bombs

304
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,559
Is because

305
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,583
You know

306
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:17,727
Maybe 15 years ago it started becoming more important not to do those types of things

307
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:21,823
Conservative right-wing commentators took their anti-Semitism in the leg

308
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,383
Into that coded language world

309
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:30,783
And he wasn't alive for that he wasn't alive for the Fallout from the first time everybody was like what if we just hated use all the

310
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:39,999
He wasn't alive for a lot of these like really important elements of the the right-wing and I wasn't live for

311
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,047
What happened after Oklahoma City

312
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,215
Probably doesn't recognize the stakes

313
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,495
For the

314
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,031
Pecan people

315
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:55,871
Importantly militia organizing

316
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,639
Yeah

317
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:01,759
Sure and he's he's a kid so you know you can always just point to this kid and be like listen

318
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,527
I know

319
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:05,087
You think you have had a brand-new idea

320
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,647
That no one's ever f****** thought of before

321
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,927
But I'm going to be honest with you

322
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,207
You have not

323
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,231
Yeah

324
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,767
Buddy

325
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,791
Yeah yeah

326
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:20,447
Set Alex's main story on this episode appears to be that the Supreme Court has decided that there is no second.

327
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,471
Which

328
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,751
I mean he reports

329
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,519
Pretty much

330
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,567
Three or four times a year

331
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:28,383
Based on a different story of some sort

332
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,919
And it is never true

333
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:33,759
20 years old I believe the Supreme Court has invalidated

334
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:38,111
The Second Amendment at least 48 x States Elmo real

335
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:42,207
He's explaining some of this stuff to a caller who has a question

336
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,999
About about this ruling

337
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,583
Wheeling by the

338
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
Supreme Court

339
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,375
YouTube

340
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,399
Oh

341
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,191
Max

342
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,471
Pay study abroad

343
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,239
Weather

344
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,263
Supreme Court

345
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,311
States rights in the face dead

346
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,335
Snappy

347
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,127
Brady Bill was unconscious

348
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,135
A what

349
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,663
Jeff Mack

350
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,943
They still

351
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,039
Indifferent

352
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,999
But it is not Constitution

353
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,519
Indeed

354
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:02,591
Completely unrelated to this caller or clip

355
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:08,991
The day after this episode was recorded these Freedom Court decided that the Potomac River was under Virginia's control

356
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:12,063
Maryland

357
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,903
I had a court battle to get to the river

358
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,440
Okay

359
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:22,816
Alex is a really bad source of information because pretty much everything he saying In that clip is incorrect

360
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:29,728
He's telling this caller inaccurate information and then using that to construct. Merritt is about the reality that we all live in

361
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:35,872
The 1997 Supreme Court case that Alex is talking about is Prince versus United States

362
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:39,456
Did not determine that the Brady gun bill was

363
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,224
Additional

364
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:46,880
That Bill had a provision that required gun background checks to be done for purchases but on the federal level that's

365
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,672
System was not prepared yet

366
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:54,816
According to the bill state law enforcement agencies were required to use their background check system to run this

367
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,632
Until such a time that the federal system was ready

368
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,544
Prince versus United States ruled that this was unconstitutional to make state law enforcement carry out federal law on

369
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,568
But activity

370
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:09,408
The state law enforcement folks were required to

371
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,688
Ask to do this

372
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,992
And if they wanted to opt out they could

373
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,296
That was the result of this ruling

374
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:20,928
Ultimately Most states had no problem with the setup and continue to participate by their own consent

375
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:25,280
I am but you should be can't move once the federal background check system was Operation

376
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,560
Naturally

377
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:32,960
Alex is lying about the Supreme Court decision to tell it this color that the government ruled the background checks for gun purchases

378
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,240
Unconstitutional

379
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,520
But they didn't care

380
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,824
They just ignore rulings that they don't like

381
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:44,736
This is a dangerous message to be sending to an audience like Alex is because if the government doesn't even follow Supreme Court to say

382
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,296
Visions then isn't everything of farce

383
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:51,392
There's literally no way the public can be involved in politics since the globalist

384
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,440
Just decide who's going to win the election

385
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,464
And they could just

386
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,304
At capriciously we decide whether or not to follow their own chords

387
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:04,704
This is not a state of affairs that anyone rational or sincere be presenting is just the way things are

388
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:08,288
This would be a message that implies that I need for action

389
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:11,360
Are all Civic participatory government-related actions are

390
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,640
Merely pointless

391
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,920
Play song he's telling

392
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,224
Yeah absolutely

393
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:22,624
This is the one that is is also the reason that Prince had to change his name to the symbol

394
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,952
Ryton Printz

395
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,744
Saudi Prince

396
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:31,840
Aziza Plus

397
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:35,936
I just like the idea that the Supreme Court

398
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:42,336
I didn't think about the Supreme Court is one of the reasons that it's so easily exploitable is because the actual decision

399
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,104
Visions

400
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,480
Are so nerdy and specific like Nana and arrow decided

401
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:51,296
Is whether or not this aligned is it

402
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,088
Acceptable to Cross by Butte

403
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:57,184
Very specific circumstances so you might as well just claim it does

404
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,976
Who gets the river

405
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,256
Yeah exactly

406
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:04,352
Exact circumstances

407
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,496
These cases in Court decisions Alex never uses specifics and that's for two reasons

408
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:15,104
One he probably doesn't know any of them because he's lazy and he does zero show prep

409
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:22,016
It's not in his interest to be specific because he's lying and he doesn't want to make it easy for his audience to follow up

410
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,808
Claims and realize that

411
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:30,720
Because he said one specific I'm left to assume that the ninth Circuit Court of Appeals case in San Francisco that he's referring to is

412
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,256
Nordyke versus King

413
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,584
That was a decision that came out in 2003 and was

414
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,632
Not accepted by the Supreme Court

415
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,776
That ruling has to do it's not with the banning guns or declining there's no Second Amendment

416
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:47,872
It was a situation where a gun dealer sued Alameda County because

417
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,408
The county has passed an ordinance

418
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,432
Possession

419
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,224
Nerf guns on County proper

420
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:58,624
This included the fairgrounds which is where nordyke begun dealer held gun shows

421
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:05,792
That ordinance was passed in 1999 and the reason was stated as being because there was a shooting that happened

422
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,608
The previous 4th of July at the Alameda Fair

423
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:12,704
There was a believed to be a bit of a confrontation

424
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,776
That resulted in injuries

425
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:18,592
Including an eight-year-old boy and two other miners

426
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:24,224
This case about this ordinance is the closest thing I can find what Alex is talking about

427
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,528
And it's nowhere close to reflecting

428
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,808
Any of his narrative

429
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,392
I wonder if he give some specifics about the story later in the episode

430
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,160
He doesn't

431
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,976
You shouldn't be optimistic

432
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,000
Information

433
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,792
It's just that

434
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:41,120
This ruling and because the Supreme Court decided not

435
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:41,888
Hear it

436
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,960
Now the second amendment's gone

437
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:49,824
Know that it did they just ruled it a county does have the ability to band

438
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,128
Vons on County property

439
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:59,040
If if you think that the Supreme Court and I mean if you think that the government is just enforcing whatever

440
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,088
Rules it likes or not

441
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,368
Then

442
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:08,768
I mean there's there's the conclusion that you know there's no point in participating in democracy at all but I would also Imagine That

443
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,048
That if you have

444
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:12,608
Guns and Alex is telling you that

445
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,168
Guns are banned in this country

446
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:20,800
And nobody's coming to stop you than your your assumption would be that they just don't want to do it right

447
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,176
Or they're waiting for the strategically right moment

448
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:31,552
There's no wind there's no way it's always going to be always f*****

449
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:37,952
When your worldview in reality is largely based on creative writing prompts it turns out

450
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:41,280
Add new layers to things constantly

451
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,072
Out of a jam

452
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:47,680
Yeah I would have kicked a lot of people out of the creative writing class if I were running it

453
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,728
A lot of people with a god

454
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:55,616
Exercise with gone on for 20 years in creative writing

455
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,152
It's a very repetitive

456
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:02,784
We need some new themes and motifs to start appearing

457
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,344
Your greatest CB after class

458
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,744
Alex has this idea about these gun bills in these Supreme Court

459
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,280
Rulings and we'll have you

460
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,304
And

461
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:18,144
You know that the NRA is derelict in its Duty

462
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,008
Cuz it's not telling people they fake versions of these bills that Alex is telling people

463
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,632
As we saw in that last clip

464
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:52,448
It's Alex was lying about these cases and rulings

465
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,776
He's the one creating false reality in order to scare his audio

466
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:02,176
Alex needs to attack these more mainstream gun organizations because they don't live in his false reality

467
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:08,832
Battle Ray can support gun rights all day long but if they don't pretend decision is the end of the Second Amendment

468
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:13,184
Alex they have to be liars and probably gun-grabbers in disguise

469
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:17,280
This strategy have a couple of good effects from Alex's fan point

470
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:23,168
The first is that it makes anything the NRA does look less extreme and always not enough

471
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:30,080
The audience will always demand that the gun rights organizations take a couple more steps than they should because they believed that there was

472
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,384
Responded to the fake stories Alex

473
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:36,736
The second effect is that the audience will push the NRA further towards

474
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,784
Living in Alex's false reality

475
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,368
Or at least behaving as if that falls reality were real

476
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,648
In order to keep up with

477
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,416
The base

478
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,696
Any sense of this

479
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:50,304
Consider the Ted Nugent was a fairly controversial person to associate with back at this point

480
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,608
He's now a member of the NRA board

481
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,680
They they have shifted a little

482
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:58,752
Due to this external pressure based on

483
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,032
Snowfall stories

484
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,360
Yeah I mean Vendetta at this point

485
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:08,224
What most people don't own an assault rifle

486
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:12,576
I mean it and it's certainly small number of people own assault rifles

487
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:15,648
The only people who were protecting they were people who are either

488
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:18,720
Overreacting because of a slippery slope argument

489
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:21,024
Or people who are like living in a

490
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:26,912
African Bungalow in Brooklyn being like I need a surface-to-air missile otherwise I won't be safe

491
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,800
And I was like well there's some other people were focusing on this story and they are folks

492
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:36,640
To like to sell guns at the fairgrounds in Alameda County

493
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:42,528
Maybe close attention to the story but

494
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,112
I understand that Alex's story is b*******

495
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,392
I have they are

496
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,952
So we had earlier

497
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:53,024
A story that is clearly nonsense

498
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,048
About you

499
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:56,352
Prison for 6 months if you mention Jesus

500
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:05,312
Call we were recording remotely for the first time forever and now the cops are out here cherries and berries

501
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:09,152
Going down I said Jesus Christ

502
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:12,736
Here's another prediction that Alex has about

503
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,272
Stuff that will happen

504
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:20,672
Enforcement standpoint in the near future

505
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,696
Did you think this happened

506
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,976
Is Alex correct

507
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,024
Hellcat

508
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,624
Pickup truck

509
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,888
What would you do

510
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,128
What is the division

511
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,160
Warrant

512
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,440
Naturally

513
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:35,424
What's okay so to get a couple years of fugitive apprehension

514
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:42,592
Yeah we're getting married we're getting a 15 16 year olds out there as bounty hunters

515
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:46,688
Excuse me sir I just want to let you know that you've been served

516
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:52,320
You didn't need to do that to graduate

517
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,344
Radish

518
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:58,976
What about to get a GED can you just drop out

519
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:05,632
Belt. If you if you get a GED you have to become a cop for 5 years

520
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:13,568
What's coming and I think he was wrong

521
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,104
I think basically

522
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,408
I don't know I just

523
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:23,040
I don't know if it's a terrible idea like that maybe I mean I think it's probably if you're bleeding

524
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:29,440
Tell people to do you know stuff like that fugitive apprehension Worth to high school

525
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:35,328
He started his things like

526
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:38,656
Pulled weeds and all that stuff and then it elevated

527
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,936
To serving warrants

528
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:40,704
Very quick

529
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:47,360
Yeah yeah volunteerism encouraging it within people in

530
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,896
High School I don't think it's bad

531
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:55,040
And when I was at the University of Missouri for a while at the office of service-learning

532
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:58,368
And it was a part of my job was to

533
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,000
Look through the course catalog and try and find courses that naturally let themselves

534
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:07,840
New volunteer opportunities being incorporated into

535
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:08,608
The curricular

536
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,144
And

537
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,936
Yeah it's that kind of stuff

538
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:15,520
I think is very positive that as

539
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:18,080
College students being forced to serve warrants

540
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:24,480
Or Suffolk neighborhood surveillance I always watch I give people

541
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,808
All around

542
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:31,136
I just thought that was pretty

543
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,928
Tell me he's like

544
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,024
I don't understand how anybody could take him seriously with that he's talking about this

545
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:43,424
Have you ever met a 15-16 year-old to sync and you trust them to

546
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:49,568
Wright-Patt listen pretty dangerous

547
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,224
Can't drive do I feel about all the other head

548
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,248
There are a lot of Opera

549
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,808
Opportunities for ambush

550
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,088
Warat issues

551
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:01,856
If it's

552
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,904
Children that you're working you're not expect

553
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,952
Children deserve a war right

554
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:12,352
So you were a little fifteen-year-old walks up to

555
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,120
Excuse me sir

556
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:19,008
Do you know which way the story's for Kohl's I need to buy a new t-shirt you've been served

557
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:26,688
I think if you're talkin about like a summons to appear or something like that there's a lawsuit that like anybody could.

558
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:31,040
Deliver that

559
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:36,416
I don't think fugitive apprehension like that implies somebody who's on the Run

560
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:42,816
Hi baby

561
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:46,912
All right we're going to take this fifteen-year-old

562
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,984
Venezuela

563
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,752
Top notch

564
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:54,848
Most Wanted FBI criminal because otherwise he won't graduate

565
00:34:55,104 --> 00:35:00,992
In order to get the college Uniden extracurriculars and some people can Debate Club

566
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,784
Some people might get into sports

567
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,832
You know if you can't make the team

568
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:09,696
Maybe you got to be Dog the Bounty Hunter

569
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:12,000
Cowboy Bebop

570
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,328
So dumb

571
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,096
Brett Gray

572
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:16,864
I love it

573
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,144
Yeah that's pretty

574
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,168
Interested

575
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:23,520
So one of the things you need to understand is that your mind has a lock on it

576
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,056
And there's a key

577
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,336
It's in the shape of a lie

578
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,128
Interesting

579
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,000
Stop

580
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:50,144
Found

581
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,496
The anti-semitic techno artists who is concerned about underwear

582
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,800
And your balls

583
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,104
The best stuff that's

584
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,432
He's pushing that pretty pretty hard

585
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,480
He's making money for

586
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,528
This pair of underwear

587
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:07,808
Is

588
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:11,392
Really really good at supporting

589
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,672
Lefty

590
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,208
But I'm telling you

591
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,488
The right side

592
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,256
Does that

593
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:20,608
With the left-right ball paradigm

594
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,656
I am

595
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:28,544
Baltaire

596
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:36,480
The show might not work if I take cough syrup

597
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,040
Amighetti's

598
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,344
Perhaps but

599
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,648
We have to enjoy a little bit of

600
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:48,000
A little bit of fun because ultimately I understand what's coming

601
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,024
And I know

602
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,560
That this next clip

603
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,096
Is a b

604
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:52,864
A bit of a shock

605
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:59,008
Answer Mike down for this Jordan this is this is another call that Alex gets

606
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,800
That's a blue me away

607
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,080
Well you don't want to call

608
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,616
Invisible Empire

609
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,064
Lakme

610
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,600
Guys around here

611
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:18,208
Well I mean that nobody knows it

612
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:20,768
The neighbor

613
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,680
Well it stopped here

614
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,264
Everybody

615
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,104
The plan

616
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:37,920
Indignation

617
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,736
They get up on her horse and a ride

618
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,064
And that's what's going to happen

619
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,120
Disgusted

620
00:37:59,424 --> 00:37:59,936
Khalid Muhammad

621
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,880
But

622
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:37,824
Normally I think I would hear someone calling to the show and claimed to be in the clan and I would really believe it

623
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,872
Bye-bye at 100%

624
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,176
In the fuc

625
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,712
King Clan

626
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,736
If there's ever been

627
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,528
He sounds pretty sincere

628
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:49,088
He's old enough to own a hood

629
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,208
30 copies of Birth of a Nation 3

630
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,488
Free handouts on

631
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,256
Christmas

632
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,536
He sounded pretty

633
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,072
Cryptic to language

634
00:38:59,328 --> 00:38:59,840
I feel

635
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,632
Lense to his credibility

636
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,680
Well you open with a riddle

637
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,216
That's what I'm saying

638
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,520
Planned loves riddles

639
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:10,336
That's what everybody does that

640
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:16,736
Now the reason this clip is important is that it really has Echoes of how Alex dealt with ye and Nick in the present

641
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:22,624
Hear the caller who's admitted to being a proud Clan member which is something Alex is supposedly again

642
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:26,976
In the same way he's supposedly against Hitler and the Nazis memes days

643
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:30,304
And yet somehow Alex can't manage to make it

644
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,376
Clear emphatic statement in opposition to these groups

645
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:40,288
With Yang and make you can't review the Nazi in Hitler's choosing instead to pretend that the ADL is worse than

646
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,616
Naked because of fake stories that he repeats over and over

647
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,664
About how they think white people are inherent

648
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,432
Evil

649
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:52,832
The only way to get voice to criticism of ye and Nick's Nazi ideas is to condemn them along with the ABS

650
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:55,904
And be very insistent that the ADL is worse

651
00:39:56,672 --> 00:40:01,792
I'm here Alex can't just tell this caller that the clan is bad and he shouldn't be a member of it

652
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:08,448
Instead he rather bizarre rationalization for why he assumes this guy joined the clan which I don't

653
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,032
Too far off from what folks in the clan might say

654
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:16,640
They also love to pretend that their racism is justified by imagining it

655
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:18,432
Only exists as a defense

656
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:20,736
Against other people being racist against them

657
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,040
This is Alex giving me a

658
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:26,368
Appearance of pushing back against this guy who literally in the clan

659
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:32,512
Well actually making excuses for him and making me act of joining a hate group a possibly unwise

660
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,816
But morally neutral decision

661
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,168
This is because Alex doesn't actually think being a member of a group is a bad thing

662
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:45,824
You can't even get through this response to the collar without speculating how white people would be arrested for open carrying

663
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,664
What black people get away with it essentially justifying and signing off

664
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,528
On the feelings of racial agreement that drive a lot of people toward these racist group

665
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,088
Here's an important thing to understand

666
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:02,208
Even if a listener or this collar word except Alex is framing of things and conceited at all

667
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:04,256
There's still no reason not to be a member of

668
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,024
The client

669
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,352
If and only if we're able to defeat the globalist

670
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:12,704
That means racist groups will stop you played against each other

671
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,240
But until that happens

672
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:17,056
And even they understand that that's never going to happen

673
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:20,128
Then these other races groups will still exist

674
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,992
The clan members and Nazis believe that they are defensive organisation

675
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,528
So if those other group

676
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:30,880
Entirely intact

677
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:37,536
I understand that Alex doesn't show up to the studio knowing they'd like he's going to be on the phone with the Klan member

678
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,840
But he definitely should have known it was a distinct

679
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,864
Possibility

680
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:46,240
Like he knows who his audiences and the fact that he doesn't have any stronger condemnation for the clan this is damn

681
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,592
Yeah I mean

682
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,872
It's it's

683
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:57,759
It should be more complicated and yet somehow it's very simple you know like

684
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:04,159
If somebody calls and tells you that the Clans member and then you go well yeah of course

685
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:04,927
You are but it's not

686
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,719
Your fault because black people are racist

687
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:08,511
You're a bad person

688
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:14,399
It's not what you would expect if you actually opposed the class

689
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,167
Listen

690
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:15,935
I get it

691
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:19,263
You're a clan member obviously black people racist

692
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:23,871
That's why the clan was invented before black people were allowed to vote and every

693
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:29,503
Oh my God no actually there the horror of all know see that can

694
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,271
Can't happen

695
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:32,575
Yeah I can happen but it's very strange

696
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:37,951
What Clan is that the Black Panther Party wants to kill a white people I'm sorry what now

697
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:41,023
Yeah that's my real problem with it

698
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,047
Ha

699
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,071
So

700
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,631
Alex tries to follow this up

701
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,399
Bye

702
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,167
Condemning

703
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:47,935
The clan

704
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:58,687
One of the things that he seems to want to do is discuss it only in terms that have nothing to do with race

705
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,295
My grandmother was a

706
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:30,431
Don't like

707
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,599
The burn down

708
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:40,671
Murdered

709
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:59,615
Control

710
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:04,991
Yeah that's a little bit

711
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:10,111
Weird so yeah it's just it's just a group that harasses business owners they don't like

712
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:13,695
Trying to get the Northerners attitude Texas

713
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,487
Let me problem with the clan

714
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,791
Is the inconvenience a lot of

715
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:18,559
People

716
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:19,327
That's it

717
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:25,727
General fashion in specific

718
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:28,031
The big problem you know it's just

719
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,055
Just no group

720
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,079
In particular

721
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,615
Plan

722
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,407
Now the clan

723
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:40,063
It's mostly just like a the Shakedown operation of businesses

724
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,903
Goemon sure they started as one thing but you don't like

725
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:48,511
VW made engines for the Nazis you know we can change

726
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,071
Yikes

727
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:53,631
So Alex Goes to commercial

728
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:56,703
Get that to get a little bit of a

729
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:59,519
A break after talking to a client

730
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:06,175
This commercial I just thought it was like I'm just play a couple seconds of it I thought this was like really f****** dumb

731
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:18,207
That's right

732
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:22,815
It's so crass to me to hear like at 9:11

733
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:25,375
Conspiracy theory being sold with that like

734
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,167
Morning radio

735
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:29,727
What is a

736
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,775
Coming up this Sunday like

737
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:35,103
I'm sorry this building

738
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,639
Coming up right after the break

739
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:43,551
Reminder say correctly your documentary is proving that the United States government did a false flag onto his own country and

740
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,879
Either way you're selling it

741
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:54,559
Yeah it's it's a little it makes me feels on Sirius

742
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,143
Baby undercuts

743
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:02,495
The level of Gravitas that your documentary by deserve

744
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,775
Another

745
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:08,383
Point that I'd like to bring up here is that we've heard Alex claim that

746
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,175
He was the number one

747
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:12,223
Voice over guy in the world

748
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:15,039
Criticizing Obama was like

749
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:18,111
Oh no you can't get any jobs

750
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:21,695
I don't think he has a place

751
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,231
In the market

752
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,279
I don't think that's good voice over work

753
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:31,935
I mean he's not going to be on a Geico commercial anytime soon with that kind of stuff he's not going to get his own recurring character

754
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:37,823
You know though they do have those Geico commercials that are like washed-up celebrities who are like in like in weird

755
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:44,223
Circumstances he might show up into the the

756
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:45,247
The new cave mode

757
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:48,575
Geico show starring Nick Kroll

758
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:51,903
I meant subtly try to sell his caveman bone broth

759
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:59,583
Going going into business for himself during the middle of this

760
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,863
Beryllium

761
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:03,679
So Alex gets a call from a mason

762
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:11,103
Lot of folks in groups called him today

763
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,639
Three that I didn't know about

764
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,431
It was it was a group heavy time

765
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:17,759
This guy is a Master Mason

766
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:21,855
And Alex believe that means that he's a 33rd degree

767
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,135
Mason

768
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,927
Answer

769
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:31,327
Is talking talking about the Hitman

770
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,887
Who builds houses for off

771
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:39,519
Before we get to the reveal they Prestige Alex has to talk about but

772
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:42,335
Stuff about how amazing the get away with murder

773
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,359
Of course

774
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,903
Unless you're amazing

775
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:57,951
Orla

776
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,487
Tubalcain

777
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:07,935
The mob

778
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:16,639
Pokemon

779
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:20,735
Running

780
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:29,183
Walked in Alaska

781
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:39,935
Yeah I got the Mason in distress sign do will Cain

782
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:49,407
So Alex is is going off on these like this grandmason stuff

783
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:55,807
Because he thinks he's got like a high-level Mason on the phone and they're going to be able to commiserate but also the guy

784
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:05,535
You started listening to Alex's show it started to wake him up and he's thinking maybe he's involved in an evil organization

785
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:11,935
So I'm going to try and lay this track that this guy is been going to be able to sign off on

786
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,471
As a high-level Mason

787
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,263
Unfortunately

788
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,287
He's not

789
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:31,135
When I said masturbation I was talking about blue eyes

790
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,207
Degree Master Mason

791
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,231
The great I Have Nots

792
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:35,999
Going into

793
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,279
The higher-level sup

794
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,559
32nd

795
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:39,839
I had many offers

796
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,119
Scion

797
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,143
Weekly

798
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:42,911
The Grotto

799
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,191
I had offers to go

800
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,215
Starwood

801
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:45,983
Which shot

802
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:46,751
Primarily

803
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:48,799
Arm of the basin

804
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,871
Going to stock price

805
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:53,663
Brighton

806
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,199
Thanks but

807
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:58,015
Little voice

808
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,319
Myself okay

809
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,623
Useful idiot here in the trenches

810
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:04,671
Fraternity

811
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,463
I ask myself

812
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:09,023
Useful idiots

813
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:11,583
The tenants that are preached

814
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:13,631
Need to be wonderful

815
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,935
What is it is it a veneer

816
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:19,263
Dark

817
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:20,799
No

818
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,479
360

819
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,015
Really

820
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:32,831
Totally

821
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:36,671
Duh

822
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:39,231
That's the human devil

823
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:46,143
There's a Zoe's principality

824
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:52,799
Yeah so Alex realizes it is guy isn't very deep into the Masons

825
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:59,199
Blow his mind

826
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:03,295
I can make up whatever I want

827
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,343
No right

828
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,183
That's the funny thing about him only being level 3 is like

829
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:10,463
He doesn't know

830
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:13,023
I already believed it could be anything

831
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:18,655
She's already suspicious of in like coming around to thinking like a maybe Alex is onto something

832
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,679
Oh hey guess what

833
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:20,959
Level 77

834
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:24,543
Even start

835
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,567
Christopher Avila

836
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:28,383
What organization invents 300

837
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,919
60 degrees

838
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:36,319
That's too many degrees way too many if you're if you're going to complain about a generation growing up with too many

839
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,599
Participation trophy

840
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:43,999
If a Masons give out a degree for everything you did for me a drink he's 38-degree now

841
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:45,791
Well and and you got to think like

842
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,839
Imagine the bureaucracy

843
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:48,863
Like

844
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,935
Imagine the micromanagement in like

845
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:56,031
Get this if you have 360° that you have to

846
00:51:57,311 --> 00:52:03,455
A good 290 of them are not for human human complete David's right

847
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:11,391
Are they the ones deciding if you chart is a mess

848
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:13,183
This raises a few important question

849
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,463
And that is

850
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:21,631
Do the demons start at level 77 or do they have to be like level 123

851
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:28,031
Are you

852
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:34,431
In the same level one classes maybe a couple of demons in there you know like you've got six humans and then there's two or three demons right with you

853
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:40,831
Or just jealous cuz you like all those m************ can get past that.

854
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:47,743
From going level 60 70 6277 murder you have to kill yourself so detailed

855
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:53,119
Right is it a transformative right into the 77th degree

856
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:58,495
Questions are unanswered because Alex

857
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:01,823
Could be one reason that could be one reason

858
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:08,223
I do love it when Alex is like I'm going to get back up from this guy I got a caller on the line it's going to be great and then Erie

859
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:11,551
Realizes I just make up whatever I want this person doesn't they don't know shitt

860
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:18,463
Very very zabumba to Freed of their though there is another Freedom that I I did definitely hear whatever

861
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:23,839
The guy was like only a third degree and I was offered the other thing Alex was chomping at just like I could

862
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:24,863
Say Annie

863
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,191
Hang right now I'm mixed with disappointment

864
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,215
Because like

865
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,751
If the guy was

866
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:34,591
You know somewhere in higher levels or was willing to pretend to be

867
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:38,943
Andy was going to sign off on Alex's like yeah you can just stress

868
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:43,295
Or whatever is it that would give him so much like credibility to this b*******

869
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:45,599
Imagine if it was

870
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:48,159
Imagine if the tables were turned in this guy was like

871
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:49,183
Not not

872
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:52,255
I'm at the 77th level here's the problem

873
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:54,559
Humans can't get past that that would

874
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:57,375
That would freak Alex out beyond all reason

875
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:00,191
Well I'm going to guess at that point you would shift

876
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:02,751
The story somehow

877
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:10,175
I can't have the rule that I cannot do that voice right now

878
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,455
A disaster

879
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:15,551
You're under the weather but we got it we got it somebody on the injured report

880
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:16,831
Questionable for today

881
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:21,439
So Alex gets another collar and this guy has an interesting question about

882
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:25,023
Planet X

883
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,031
I want to dance

884
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:36,799
Ask you about

885
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:38,591
Planet X

886
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:42,175
Is it for real what is

887
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,223
And I also wanted to

888
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,271
Shell if you could

889
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,063
Who killed

890
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:48,831
John F

891
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,207
Two big ones

892
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:58,047
Two big ones at the same time

893
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:04,703
Hey what about this other planet that secretly there and while you're at it

894
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:11,103
Gourmet baby you don't answer maybe you do but why

895
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,639
Might as well throw the question

896
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:16,479
Asking Alex about JFK who did it

897
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,247
The impulse

898
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:20,063
Impulse buys I picking up some gum

899
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:23,903
So here's Alex's take on Planet X

900
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:54,367
Planet variant which was an issue

901
00:55:59,487 --> 00:55:59,999
Titanic

902
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,031
Last Summer

903
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:17,151
I know what you didn't do last summer

904
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:27,135
A clock

905
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:36,863
Stop

906
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:58,879
Yeah so you understand I can't I can't follow that whatsoever it wanted to hoax into it's also

907
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:02,975
Closer than they expected it to me it's both of those things

908
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:08,351
It's not the 10th Planet it's Mars or something and it's really a metaphor for the occult Rising

909
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:11,167
Astrologist

910
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:17,311
Along with religious sect

911
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:21,663
But he seems to know everything about everything which is a Hallmark of a

912
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:22,687
Cool person

913
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,223
His name is

914
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:26,015
Text Mars

915
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:28,063
So I think he does know everything about

916
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,111
Both technology and Mars

917
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:31,135
That makes perfect

918
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:34,719
Htx at EXE

919
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:40,863
And Marrs so

920
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,399
Probably probably

921
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:44,447
So yeah

922
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:47,007
Play Planet X was b******* that was

923
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:53,407
Made up by zecharia sitchin by because he was funded by The Rockefellers

924
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:54,943
Chesnaught

925
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:58,271
Alex is going to need to substantiate that somehow

926
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:00,575
Butts

927
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,415
He's been writing but this s*** since 1976

928
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:07,487
But you think that's when the 12th Planet first came out

929
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:08,511
Book

930
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10,303
They began that series

931
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:13,887
That was based on like Erich von daniken s***

932
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:14,911
So like bright

933
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:19,519
Yeah the Chariots of the Gods is in her mixed in with this and that was like in the six

934
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:23,871
I don't know I don't know how all of that is supposed to be like

935
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:26,687
A predictor of

936
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:28,479
The rise of the

937
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:29,759
Cult in 2000

938
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:30,527
M3

939
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:32,063
It didn't seem to do anything

940
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,879
I think I think what it is

941
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,415
Is VM

942
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:37,183
Bishan

943
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:39,231
Of naming your book the 12th

944
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:39,999
Planet

945
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,327
Cuz that skips over both the 10th on the 11th like

946
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:46,143
We're just assuming already that you know about those

947
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:46,911
Secret plan

948
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:49,471
Like that's what sticks with you

949
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:51,007
A guy with

950
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:54,079
With ambition bigger than the Stars

951
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:54,847
Rice if you will

952
00:58:55,615 --> 00:59:00,735
Yeah I mean I'm not proud to admit this I have read the 12th Planet

953
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:03,807
Yeah

954
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:04,831
Planet Smoothie

955
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:07,135
I wish I remembered

956
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:14,815
It is not something that is stuck out in my mind as like a mop

957
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:16,863
Tiamaa is one of them I think

958
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,655
Always bad when you name something

959
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:21,727
Tiamat that's that's a sign that you're not really paying that much

960
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:24,287
Trying to look this up here

961
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:25,311
CT

962
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:28,383
Then give me a breakdown of what these planets are

963
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:32,991
Weather is like okay so like there's an aburu right

964
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,807
It like hit Tiamat

965
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,087
Enantiomers

966
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,111
Broke

967
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:40,159
I don't f****** remember who knows

968
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:43,999
I just worried about how the acronym is going to work

969
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:46,559
Mnemonic device

970
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:49,119
I seen it like my very Earthly

971
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:53,215
Mother and then I don't know what happens after Pluto

972
00:59:55,775 --> 01:00:01,151
Sure or you might have to interject it into the cuz it might be closer at times

973
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:02,175
Here's another thing

974
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:06,015
In the meantime since he wrote that book Pluto no longer a planet

975
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:07,551
True Galaxy 11

976
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:08,319
Planet

977
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:09,087
Unless

978
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:12,927
He's also found another one

979
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:14,975
You never know

980
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:18,815
So yeah Alex was was cool

981
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:23,679
But he knew that this was bulshit he wasn't going in with the end of the world claims or anyting

982
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,207
Calendar

983
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,095
Years from now

984
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:16,671
Goriyan gallan

985
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:25,631
That was easy for Alex to call out because that's what he does to

986
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:31,007
I was going to say it's almost like somebody predicting a financial collapse or perhaps

987
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:34,591
A summer of Rage every single year or month

988
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:41,247
Right we just had our calculations a little bit over the FedEx something to stop them

989
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:48,927
Or the Rizal diesel fuel in the United States like to eat

990
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:51,231
3 weeks with no diesel

991
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:57,375
It's been awhile since we've lost all of the diesel fuel in all the trucks

992
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,143
Falling apart

993
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:04,543
But even like to take the other stuff like the the globalist are about to make their move they've made their move

994
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:10,175
Do you not like the FEMA camps are coming it's it's right around the time

995
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:14,527
I am his audience just has I don't know why but don't know Limited

996
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:17,087
Tolerance words being like Oh Yeah

997
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:19,903
You managed to stop it or something

998
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:23,999
Respectful to point out the scam you're doing

999
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:29,631
And blame other people in the same way that all psychics and mediums are always like listen

1000
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:30,911
I get it

1001
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:37,311
You think that psychics and mediums are b******* because the other ones are but I'm the real one you know

1002
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:40,127
That kind of thing where it's like if everybody else is b*******

1003
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,151
So where are you

1004
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:43,967
What's a little bit disrespectful but on another level and also

1005
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:49,599
Kind of seems to indicate a little bit that maybe Alex has perception of himself is that he is not

1006
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:50,367
That

1007
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,391
Which is sad

1008
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:53,183
If that's the case that is a bummer

1009
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:55,487
But yeah could be

1010
01:02:55,999 --> 01:03:00,607
31 Westcliff Dr and it's Alex responding to this guy's second question

1011
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:02,399
Which is the JFK question

1012
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:04,191
And

1013
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:04,959
This

1014
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:12,127
Kind of bummed me out because I don't I last 2003 episode we we had a little conversation about the admitted Widow

1015
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:15,199
The Lady Bird Johnson

1016
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:18,527
Liechtenstein

1017
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:25,183
The goalposts a little bit here on this episode

1018
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:27,743
Cornered

1019
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:47,967
I ordered the hit

1020
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:57,439
Leslie Butler is involved

1021
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:05,631
I'm sorry what you doing

1022
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:08,703
John in North

1023
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:09,471
North Carolina

1024
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:11,775
That's quite a number of reasons

1025
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:18,175
Apparently why JFK was killed by the bankers

1026
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:24,575
People didn't kill.jfk considering there were so many reasons to do was like murder on the Orient Express it was like

1027
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:27,135
Everybody had a reason

1028
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:29,951
Tomorrow could have gotten to the bottom of this

1029
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:35,071
Widow to lbj's mistress

1030
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:37,375
Seems like Alice's really sweat the small stuff

1031
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:40,959
Like talkin accurately and say things

1032
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:47,871
I was referring to Madeline Brown a woman who has been widely discredited by people who have looked at their claim

1033
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:54,783
She alleged that she was at a party in Dallas the night before the assassination with folks including but not limited to

1034
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:57,343
LBJ Nixon and J Edgar Hoover

1035
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,111
But

1036
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,391
Concrete evidence

1037
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:00,927
All of these people except

1038
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:03,999
Nixon outside of Dallas that entire night

1039
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:06,047
They could not have been there and

1040
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:09,887
Nixon's whereabouts were accounted for in Dallas

1041
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:13,983
Isaiah if you got those guys in the same room in Dallas

1042
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:16,287
That's the room I'm assassinating

1043
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:26,015
The meaning is essentially impossible to have happened which is where the threat to kill JFK was said to have happened

1044
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:27,039
You can kind of see how this

1045
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:30,111
Pokes a gigantic hole in her story

1046
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,135
Because it's

1047
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:35,231
Then the other know how that statement work

1048
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:40,095
Subsequent investigation of her past has shown that she's been of a fraud person

1049
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:41,631
Haven't been a convicted

1050
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:45,727
Elderly relative in 1988

1051
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:52,639
She's kind of like a JFK era Larry Nichols type so it makes sense that she and Alex will get together and

1052
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:53,919
Stirrup the b*******

1053
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:56,991
Together but that's the admitted Widow that sucks

1054
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:04,159
It would suck more if like ladybird for real

1055
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:10,559
Unusual then we be in Nelson medley being Mandela effect territory

1056
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:17,727
Was actually there

1057
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:19,775
One sign that things have changed

1058
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:21,311
I would imagine

1059
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:24,639
I would imagine if ladybird been on Alex would not stop talking

1060
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:26,687
Going about it even to the present so

1061
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:30,015
That should have been a clue for us but that was that did not happen

1062
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:31,295
Bi-Rite that one

1063
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:40,767
God what would that be like if a city like even and I mean even if we could teleport

1064
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:42,815
Benefiting

1065
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:45,887
I'm just supposed broadcast end up back then

1066
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:48,703
Vicky Blake

1067
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:50,239
What what

1068
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:56,639
Vice president like what first lady goes on what show would be as insane as lady bird show

1069
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:00,991
Hillary

1070
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:04,063
Nancy Reagan showing up anywhere would be fine

1071
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,135
Come on Hillary baby

1072
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:12,511
Tipir tipir going on

1073
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:16,095
Howard Stern

1074
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:18,911
Never go against turd might be as crazy as that

1075
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:24,543
Uncle Luke Luke Skywalker from 2 Live Crew had a podcast

1076
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:31,967
Listen to the hell out of that

1077
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:33,759
Heading to yes I would lose my s***

1078
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:40,927
Yeah that would be Luke Skywalker
