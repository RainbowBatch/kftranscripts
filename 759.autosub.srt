1
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for knowledge but I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

2
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
Need

3
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:59,392
College vype.com

4
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:05,792
Everyone welcome back to fight knowledge I am Jordan and unfortunately Dan is

5
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,816
Not with us

6
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:07,840
Today

7
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:10,400
He is still under the weather with

8
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,448
An undisclosed but

9
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,496
Non life-threatening illness

10
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:20,896
So luckily we have the incredible Ace Attorney Morgan

11
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,944
Stringer joining me today

12
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,224
How are you

13
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,528
I'm good

14
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,552
It's

15
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:32,928
I guess if my moniker I've gotten is Ace associate but they made the same thing so

16
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,024
Turn the video game

17
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:44,192
I think I may have been thinking Harvey Birdman attorney at law that could be

18
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:51,872
Might my only reference to law is Harvey Birdman and then I think there was a dancing baby on

19
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:52,896
Ally McBeal one time

20
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,688
That is what I've got

21
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,736
I mean that's a good place to

22
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,272
Start so

23
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:03,392
Well I apologize for getting your Appalachian wrong but

24
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:09,792
Thank you so much for joining me today I suppose the first thing that we should talk about if you

25
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,072
You don't mind

26
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,632
Is an update on Alex

27
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,680
Six bankruptcies circumstance

28
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,728
What's the most recent information

29
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,032
So

30
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:20,800
Do you know

31
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,872
You're you're wearing Jordan of how you get really mad

32
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:29,248
When the media reports things about Alex and then it turns out to not really be that thing

33
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,528
Me

34
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:36,928
Good Heavens no even-keeled fan of Cullman quiet

35
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,696
B I do

36
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:41,536
That's why I wanted you to start right here because I assume something is wrong

37
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:45,120
Wild crazy wife

38
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,984
Missing that tornado with energy but

39
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:55,872
So speaking of that. I had the same thing where Iowa

40
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:59,968
I'll have that same reaction when I see the Press get these things wrong about you

41
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,248
Is formation figures

42
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,528
Pop culture figures

43
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,552
And also

44
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,880
With the law it really frustrates me how

45
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,928
You know we do have a lot of good legal reporters

46
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,952
Was Williamson

47
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,512
She's done a great job on this but

48
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,792
Of course

49
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,096
A lot of other people just need to stop

50
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,144
But they need to stop so

51
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,056
Frustrated because I see the headline and I see some tweets

52
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:28,384
You know that of course have 50000 likes on them by this

53
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,408
Dwight saying

54
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:35,808
Oh absolutely Alex doesn't have to pay the one-and-a-half billion-dollar judgment or he does have to

55
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:39,392
To pay that one and a half billion dollar judgment and a judge has you know

56
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,440
Taking away his ability to fight it

57
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,976
And course

58
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,256
That's not what happened

59
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,536
At all

60
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,096
So I thought I was crazy

61
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,400
Actually cuz I was saying well you know this

62
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:56,800
This Outlet is saying it just happened and I don't remember that happening how about you know blacked out somehow and

63
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,080
Remember something different

64
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,896
And no it turns out I was right

65
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:05,248
So it's a considers like there is a consent judgment in place

66
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,296
Which means that both Alex

67
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,832
And the plaintiffs are green

68
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,368
Everyone's in a green

69
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:11,904
Okay

70
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,768
Wow okay first off that's that's a monumentous thing that you just said

71
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:23,423
Yeah so what happened is the families who have already had their cases heard

72
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,751
Those cases they have lifted the stay on that

73
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:33,407
But the only things better left or I guess with formal entry of judgment in the Texas case which that case is already

74
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,175
Ben

75
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,223
You know basically is already done

76
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,271
And it's just have a judge can interpret judge

77
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,063
And dad in Connecticut

78
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:45,951
The only two motions left our Norm has emotion of remitted her which means he wants

79
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,975
The judge to reduce

80
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,767
The Judgment in the Connecticut case

81
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:53,631
Because my number is big I wish I was exaggerating. Ray sippin

82
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,191
But

83
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:02,591
In anyway when you're looking at a number like 1.5 billion honestly I feel like that's a reasonable a

84
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,615
Ask just to be like

85
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:10,271
This number is bigger than I understand I mean yes and we divided by 15

86
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,807
People invent

87
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:16,927
You hear you know everything that happened and you here but you know testimony in that courtroom

88
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,999
I can see where some people say oh that's not even enough

89
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,791
Oh totally

90
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
Totally

91
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:29,215
That was one of the things that I was thinking about it and whenever the verdict was about to be handed down is

92
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:33,567
You know before the Texas trial even happened I said

93
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,127
If I think it should be in the

94
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,711
Ballpark of 250 million or something along those lines

95
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,991
And it's like

96
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,319
How could a reasonable person though

97
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,367
Get to a number that big

98
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:49,695
Like I can't even understand what a million dollars is

99
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,975
In my real life

100
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,767
Let alone a billion

101
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,535
You know

102
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:57,631
Yeah well you're kind of right on the money there when you're talkin about you know

103
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,447
People like Robbie Parker who did get about

104
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,727
I want to say

105
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,495
Total amount

106
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,263
What's 200 million

107
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,031
But

108
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,335
Including

109
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,127
Peter doesn't

110
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:08,895
And everything

111
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,431
Steaks out but

112
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,551
But yeah so that's not what happened what happened it though is that the judgment

113
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,855
Has been lifted onto those cases just at 4

114
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
Procedural issues

115
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,207
You should go forward Norm is also has a motion for a new trial which

116
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:27,071
Everybody knows Norm even knows it those his motions are going to get denied

117
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,375
But basically the bankruptcy court is saying

118
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:33,983
Yeah those judgments and go ahead and be entered and then you can proceed with the appeals process

119
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:34,751
Windows

120
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:39,103
Now the Fontaine case and the Posner case those are still

121
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:46,783
So I'm yeah that's that's what's happening there it was not a judge saying

122
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:53,183
Up Alex has to write a check tomorrow you know and that that's that's what I feel like a lot of people

123
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:59,583
Got wrong here and also I did want to say this hasn't come up yet it has

124
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,375
Time to come up in the background of the

125
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:05,215
Conversations as I've kind of read between the lines

126
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:05,983
Listen to the

127
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:06,751
The attorneys

128
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,031
These hearings with

129
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,055
Lopez

130
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,103
The bankruptcy court but

131
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,151
Bankruptcy code section 52

132
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:13,919
2386

133
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:18,015
Actually prevents a debtor from being discharged for any debt for

134
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:23,135
The willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another in

135
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:28,511
So actually hopefully malicious injuries cannot be discharged in bankruptcy regardless

136
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,351
And I think this is going to be litigated on it

137
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,143
Discounts but I would say

138
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,471
You know the punitive damages which had to be awarded

139
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,751
If a were if you know the

140
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,543
The jury found that he

141
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,335
His conduct was willful and malicious

142
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,871
I mean

143
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,407
Speaks to itself right

144
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:48,735
I really just think that I'm busy

145
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,063
These bankruptcies know the personal one and the company one

146
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,343
Is Alex Delany

147
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,647
Because what I noticed was when I watch

148
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,927
The latest Texas

149
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,743
I saw mark

150
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:06,655
Essentially saying okay well we're fine to go ahead and schedule Fontaine and Posner because we can proceed against Alex

151
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,423
Individual

152
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,471
And

153
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:14,335
I get that low and behold December 2nd he files for person

154
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,103
Bankruptcy

155
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,943
But I think that this isn't going to end up backfiring

156
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,735
I think his strategy

157
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,759
Here is that he

158
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
He is going to

159
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,295
To try to

160
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,319
Yo Drive East fam

161
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,087
Movies out

162
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,623
We're going to have to go through the whole Bank

163
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,695
See processors you know creditor committee and a personal

164
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,719
And there's that you know

165
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,511
We're going to have to submit plans

166
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,047
Answer three paid data

167
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
Negotiate

168
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,583
All that out

169
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,607
Between all the creditors

170
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,631
The company won

171
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
So I

172
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,703
Think what he Evander see if he'll spray

173
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,239
And I think what Alex

174
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,519
Is doing here is he

175
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,543
He's trying to

176
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,823
Number one by more time for

177
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,103
From self and number two

178
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,175
Where are these families down hoping that they'll settle

179
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:57,599
Brightright so essentially whenever we read any reporting from the news for probably than

180
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:01,695
Next year too it should just be taken with a grain of salt that means

181
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,487
It's still going on

182
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,279
I mean really

183
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,815
Still a struggle

184
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,839
Any kind of

185
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,911
You know it's illegal reporting I feel needs

186
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,935
You know he would ask

187
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:18,335
Behind it you know it it's just I don't understand what's going on with legal reporting and of course I'm an attorney so I'm

188
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,639
Picky about that but it's still

189
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:27,551
I just wish people would henagar running into your running into a big problem with legal reporting and so far

190
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,319
Far as

191
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:32,159
The people who read news want something to have happy

192
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:35,743
And in the law things are always

193
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:40,095
About to happen once that motion gets filed

194
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,399
Then we'll see you in a couple of weeks

195
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,447
I said once that couple of weeks happen

196
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,495
Well I will file tomorrow

197
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,775
Vita like that Scott

198
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,055
Mistrustful

199
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:55,455
It is I and II definitely can see that yeah I mean there is a lot doesn't make

200
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,479
Splashy hat

201
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
Right right

202
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,903
But there are some that some things to at that you

203
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,695
That they could have actually reported

204
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:10,559
Like the fact that Alex was popping in and out of his latest hearing it was virtually

205
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:15,423
Virtual on zoom and he kept you know alright being in and out you know

206
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:21,823
What was what was he doing popping in and out I have no idea and I don't know if it was his Zoom

207
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,359
Being glitchy but yeah

208
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,943
I do I have no idea I think he was just so you know

209
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,479
Again it shows his lack of

210
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,247
Seriousness

211
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,575
Cases as usual

212
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,671
And yeah his attorney actually claimed

213
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
.

214
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,815
He need a basically did the I need money

215
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,095
Argument

216
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,119
So we

217
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,655
What are the four reasons why I think this

218
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,983
This Dom is because now Alex is having to expose his fine

219
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,543
That's right you have

220
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,847
And I think this was one of the dumbest things

221
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:58,175
He could do when he filed for bankruptcy the first time I said

222
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,199
I can't believe

223
00:10:59,455 --> 00:10:59,967
If he did that

224
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,783
So Jose are saying that his

225
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,623
Initially was saying his salary is 20000 every 2 weeks

226
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:14,303
Company bankruptcy that's a normal salary for most people

227
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,375
Mosta Average Joe's putting on their hard hats

228
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:20,959
Going to work everyday weeks is regular right

229
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,495
I don't make a frac

230
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:29,151
About much which you know maybe baby I should be practicing law more like normal but you know is a whole other

231
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:29,919
Brat but

232
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,991
Yes / judge

233
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:37,855
Did Joshua Jackson probably buy some local insurance if I want to work work work

234
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,231
Exactly

235
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:49,631
Yes if it judge was asked though to force Free Speech systems to pay Jones 54

236
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,399
4000

237
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,423
Every two weeks

238
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:58,335
And the judge said okay well I want to address this later and you're going to have to submit it to me more than just

239
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,359
I need money

240
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,407
So

241
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,967
So if I so if I understand correctly

242
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,735
Alex

243
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,271
Is bankruptcy lawyer

244
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,807
Said to a judge

245
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,111
How about pay me

246
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:15,743
Almost three times as much every two weeks and the reason is cuz I would like three times as much every two weeks

247
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,791
That's what Alex himself was saying

248
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:21,119
Yes.. Amazing paid out from

249
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,399
From Infowars

250
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,423
Free Speech systems

251
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:28,287
And Alice's lawyer also made the argument that if this was denied

252
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,591
That Alex will have to find more work

253
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,199
God

254
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
Yes

255
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,735
Please

256
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:42,111
Please I want to see Alice's sidegig I want to see a psychic

257
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:46,207
If if you could watch Infowars broadcast

258
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:51,839
And then getting an Uber with Alex Jones I think that would be the ultimate in

259
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,863
GoodLife really

260
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:59,775
Which brings me to a question I wanted to ask you Jordan what is the funny or job

261
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,335
What is the funniest second job that you think Alex

262
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,103
Can take

263
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
I mean

264
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,991
The obvious answer would be mine

265
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:15,647
Because to sit to see him naturally he would have to be

266
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,463
In the most public of spaces

267
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:22,303
With the only restriction being you can't talk

268
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,071
Of course

269
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,119
That one's a good start

270
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:30,239
I think the other funny side job would be the person who

271
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:34,079
Feed lions and then accidentally Falls in in an Indiana Jones

272
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,383
That would be cool

273
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:43,807
Batman I mean he almost was a movie star so yes it was

274
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:49,183
See you there Star-Lord or being eaten by lions and it Indiana Jones movie I'm fine with both

275
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,207
Truly

276
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:58,143
But that's it that's you bring up something you have been watching almost all of these hearings if not all

277
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,495
It was them and regularly live-tweeting these out have you been

278
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,799
Have you added literally been all of the hearing

279
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:11,199
I think I may have because I did get a heads-up from an attorney saying

280
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
This is just a

281
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,503
Scheduling hearing

282
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,575
You don't have to be here

283
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:27,327
Say off. He was very very nice about it but he was letting me know basically this is a meeting just

284
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:33,727
Schedule something in the future you know just saying it's going to be 10 minutes tops which I appreciate it but also

285
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,799
Man all these people are aware of me

286
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:43,199
Which procedure next week is going to be

287
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:46,783
Normandy mtume you got me advice for me

288
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,319
Buffalo

289
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:54,719
That's like the most inverted deepthroat that there ever could be like there is a secret connection you have between

290
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,743
The lawyers but

291
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,047
In the in the parking alley it's just

292
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,327
Will see you tomorrow

293
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:05,727
There is actually which I you know I've been with all seriousness I have been thanked by it

294
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:09,311
And I can't believe it they found anything of value as to what you know

295
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,895
I've said but basically yes so I

296
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
You don't know

297
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,711
Told you you know

298
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,503
Earlier we're

299
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,087
I'm not a big fan of a lot of legal reporting

300
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,159
Answer so I'm not a fan of a lot of

301
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:27,487
Legal analyst in Long crime was covering another first

302
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,583
Or babe actually covered Connecticut trial but I knew they're going to ashamed

303
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,399
People job on that and also I knew a lot of Bad Axe

304
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,191
Jurors were probably going to

305
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:39,263
Talk about the Texas trial and hello poor Alex

306
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,079
He's being railroaded and I really do not want that to happen

307
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:46,687
So what I do because I don't know something is wrong with me

308
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:53,087
Was I decided to throw myself into the abyss and I said okay I'm going to wash this entire trial and

309
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:53,855
And I'm going to

310
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:57,183
Just say what's happening and then give my legal

311
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:01,023
Analysis where I think I have some or give you know Otis

312
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,303
What I would do or

313
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,095
This is why I think Mark Bankston

314
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:04,863
Finish doing Acts

315
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,631
Send here's

316
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,399
You know

317
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,959
The wherewithal is probably screwing up and needs

318
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,495
Do you know change tactics

319
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,543
Which happen

320
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:18,943
Inconsistent

321
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,247
And yet mystifying all the same

322
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:25,855
May I doubt that was also a challenge I was watching you know especially with the Connecticut

323
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,135
Trial just thinking

324
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:31,231
I can't even get in your head to see what you're trying to do

325
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:37,887
What's up with Norm Norm when you were watching the

326
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,911
The Texas trial

327
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:44,031
You can see right now is it is a professional who's trying to do a la job

328
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,567
If you will

329
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:51,967
In my in my dumb way of saying it and Norm seems like he was just throwing caution to the wind

330
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:55,551
Drop-in smoke bombs and falling asleep all over the place right

331
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,343
Oh man it was like

332
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:01,695
Oh man the ending when he did that litigators prayer I asked

333
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,719
Sandaroo

334
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,511
Torres who I work

335
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,791
Format the firm butt

336
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:12,959
I got Andrew Torres is my personal attorney according to a Twitter conversation that I

337
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,239
Considered legally blind

338
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:18,335
I don't know that but he should do well it doesn't apply to me

339
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:24,735
Not yet not yet but I just young

340
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,527
But

341
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:33,951
Yeah so Norm it was just babbling and I asked Andrew I said is visit thing I've

342
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:37,791
Never heard this in my life please tell me this isn't a thing

343
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,583
And Andrew said

344
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:44,447
When I told him about it he said I have no idea what the f*** that man was talking about

345
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:50,591
Animals are just wet you know what's going south which I always say juries are mysterious creatures you don't want to you know

346
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:57,247
Get inside their heads too much inside yourself out because who knows when groups of people come together you know what

347
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,319
Care about versus what they're not going to care about that's why I really like

348
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,087
If a jury question

349
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:01,855
Texas

350
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,903
But anyway so

351
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,695
But you know it's going

352
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:10,559
When the jurors were you know avoiding eye contact

353
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,327
Switch Norm

354
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:15,679
And he is away

355
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:20,799
Oh man that was it that was just so rough and

356
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,127
It is a little bit like Erykah Badu

357
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,151
I can clearly

358
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,455
I have brought all of you shame

359
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,759
And you don't want to be associated with

360
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:30,783
No

361
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,599
Here's why I am correct

362
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,415
Yeah but I also think that this

363
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,183
Strategy

364
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:40,255
She was dumb because there are trustees

365
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,535
Assigned a bankruptcy case

366
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,303
Suzanne

367
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,703
There's a whole conversation about Alex's is going to get on the stand in line and we know how often you know perjury is it

368
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,751
Prosecuted especially for a civil case

369
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,519
That's right

370
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,567
They are for bankruptcy

371
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:58,431
Brought on a bankruptcy yet there are people assigned in every bankruptcy case

372
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,455
It's called a trust

373
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:05,855
And what they do is basically, most of the time they're just overseeing to make sure of a bankruptcy court

374
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,159
You know it's going along smoothly and everything

375
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,695
Working according to procedure

376
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,975
But in

377
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:16,351
These kind of cases in the trial of Alex Jones it is not a most of the time scenario

378
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:20,959
It is not at all because of the types of bankruptcy that

379
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,239
He has filed here

380
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:26,079
You have a little bit more supervision here from the u.s. trustee

381
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,639
And basically what they can do is

382
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:31,711
It's their job essentially one of their major jobs

383
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:35,551
Is to look for fraud and make sure fraud isn't being done

384
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,575
And if they see

385
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,367
Suspected they refer it to but

386
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,391
Department of Justice

387
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,951
And it gets investigated or

388
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,487
Oftentimes Prosecco

389
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:47,583
And a lot of times when that happens they uncover a bunch of other crime

390
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:51,423
Because chances are if you're lying to the bankruptcy court you're probably not

391
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,703
You know I've been up

392
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:58,847
Only open up on your books right so if you're one of these trustees at this point

393
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,639
You have to be like

394
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:06,271
Rubbing your hands together with maniacal Glee or something like that right like

395
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:10,111
You look at everything Alex has done so far and you go well

396
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,903
I I don't know if I can

397
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,951
Fall asleep without hitting fraud

398
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,231
On the way down

399
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,511
Like it is

400
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,791
Unreal right

401
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:21,887
Yes and you have to disclose you know he's different assets which I think

402
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:24,191
To me I was thinking well I would be

403
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,983
Hang up especially close attention

404
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,007
I'm here because

405
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:31,359
It's going it might indicate where he has hidden some of his ass

406
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,943
And a yasso

407
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,991
You deaf I was bewildered

408
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,015
When he did I mean

409
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,319
It's in your another delay tactic and I think

410
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,343
You trying to get the

411
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,879
Families again

412
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,647
And to settle in

413
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,183
Rachel elassar about

414
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:45,951
Just so he goes

415
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,975
This way but

416
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,511
I mean

417
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:51,071
His behavior has been completely shameful

418
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,095
Call abs

419
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,119
It Beyonce

420
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,679
Hiiraan

421
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,959
Why would you settle with him

422
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,799
No it ain't it feels a feels a little bit like

423
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:05,407
Who is is almost pot committed to this strategy of like

424
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:08,223
String it out as long as I pause

425
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,247
Can

426
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:13,343
And then maybe Hail Mary they'll they'll get tired but

427
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,416
I mean at this point it's hard to imagine that being

428
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,184
Impossible

429
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:20,256
Yeah it's going to end you know I know

430
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:23,584
We talked about earlier how it feels like there's a motion to you know

431
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,936
Do another motion later and things like that

432
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:32,544
Yeah and the end that's this is whereabouts going to you know

433
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,336
And

434
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:38,176
Yeah we'll see where and also Alex wanted to join

435
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:38,944
Is the bankruptcies

436
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,968
Together and have them

437
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,504
Play together in this way

438
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:45,344
You know whatever applied to the personal bankruptcy would apply to the company

439
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,136
Trustee

440
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,208
I'm not a bankruptcy lawyer but

441
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:53,280
I used to work for a firm that did some of it

442
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,608
I have never seen a trustee object to join

443
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,632
Bankruptcy

444
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,544
And the reason obviously

445
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:09,152
Because they're not like

446
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:09,920
What the

447
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:15,296
What you join them for is so that it can go a lot smoother and easier and both trustees

448
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:18,880
So wasn't just a personal bankruptcy trustee but the one and it for his

449
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:19,648
Corporate

450
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,256
Bankruptcy John did and said yeah what that guy said basically

451
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:30,656
I've never seen two trustees file you know the emotions like that but

452
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:36,544
They're essentially saying No this is actually going to make it more chaotic because what applies to Alex personally

453
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,336
May not apply to accompany person

454
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,640
Under the law and vice-versa and your

455
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,664
Just going to Aldi

456
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,712
This confusion which

457
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,528
You know I'm willing to bet Alex also was hoping

458
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,552
What he could work

459
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,344
His Advantage because

460
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,880
Eventually is at the end of the day

461
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,184
Destructive agent of Chaos

462
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,464
Why not too bad in a bank

463
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,488
In bankruptcy for

464
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:56,768
As well

465
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,792
And the trustees

466
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,840
These are you know very strongly indicated

467
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:00,864
Absolutely

468
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,656
Play not this is not how they should be done

469
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:09,824
And the question I think a lot of people have as far as you know you you put a point to that this

470
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,848
Will end

471
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,872
At a certain point

472
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:12,896
I think

473
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,176
The big question

474
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,456
For most people is

475
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,624
The way that Alex is doing this now he's clearly stringing it out even more he's as you said

476
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,648
You know he's doing this

477
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,440
The trustees are saying no

478
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,976
At what point

479
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,792
Does biscuit stop.

480
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,560
For him

481
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:35,168
Because it's clear to everyone involved right that this is not

482
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,216
Nothing is in good faith

483
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,752
Rhino absolute

484
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,032
And I think

485
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:40,800
Drink.

486
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,080
This

487
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,640
I think another thing that dreamy today

488
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:45,920
Ace wise

489
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,688
Bear

490
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,224
I cannot stand

491
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,248
Grifter lawyers

492
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,040
I can't stand grifters

493
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,368
I also can't stand right-wing weirdos and you had this

494
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,136
You know

495
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,928
And then also I

496
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:01,024
Cover cases that have to do with pop culture so you had this intersection of all these

497
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,096
The intercept

498
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:07,936
Weirdo

499
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,472
Bye

500
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:14,592
Yeah this is a very specific Venn diagram that you are dead center in exactly

501
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,360
Exactly

502
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,384
Play and

503
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,944
Yeah I think that we have this

504
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,760
We have a situation where

505
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:24,064
I think people finally said enough is enough

506
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:27,392
You know we saw this with Rudy Giuliani being recommended that he

507
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,416
Disbarred

508
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,696
I think Bar Association

509
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:34,048
Since I finally had it of attorneys acting like they can disregard the rules

510
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,072
They can even

511
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,352
Willfully break the rules

512
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,632
And guess what

513
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,168
Here's how much it's going to cost

514
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,984
And it's going to be less but has you actually

515
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,008
Dissipated

516
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,288
Engaged

517
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:51,712
And I think that their Wall Street receives a fine that's one tenth of what they made

518
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,248
Heat off of the crime and you're like

519
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,808
Well that's that's just a cut

520
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,112
You know you're just taking a tent off the top that's fine

521
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,696
And I think this was a big concern with the with

522
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,232
Judge Gary Gamble

523
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,256
Judge Myers

524
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,280
Call her

525
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:11,936
Affectionate

526
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:17,312
I need some policy won't communities that are very very fond of both judges blood has

527
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,848
You know fun Texas

528
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:23,456
Mom energy the other one has fun New England Aunt energy it's

529
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,272
You got four judge Bella's butt

530
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:32,928
What a weird world we live in a strange world

531
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,208
So

532
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,768
Yeah judge Campbell was talking about you.

533
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,816
These kind of principles and how

534
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:41,888
She said that the cap should not apply she was going to go ahead and

535
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,656
A judgement

536
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,936
For the entire thing because

537
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:47,264
She takes her oath seriously she took an oath to the Constitution

538
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,544
Fusion she took an oath

539
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,336
But to also do what

540
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,104
Spare

541
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,384
And she said

542
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,664
This case is unique

543
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,712
This was a horrible thing.

544
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,480
What happened here

545
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,552
And this is the only recourse for bees fam

546
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,112
And I just

547
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,648
I'm so glad that somebody is

548
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,928
Is finally saying

549
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,696
You know

550
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,232
At the end of the day just

551
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,512
This is also about

552
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,280
Fairness

553
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,072
And what is right

554
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,632
And you don't want to incentivize

555
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:17,472
Go to say oh well if I just don't participate in Discovery

556
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,240
I can just

557
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:21,056
Drag this thing out alone and this is the most

558
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,616
The biggest number I'm going to have to

559
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,384
Write on the check

560
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:30,528
Yeah absolutely don't want to encourage that and again I think people are just tired of these

561
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,552
Please griffor lawyers

562
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,112
You know back when I was in Lost

563
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:34,880
School

564
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,672
I would complain about lawyer Joe

565
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,208
Jack's Rio everybody thinks

566
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,024
For such bad guys and now that I am an attorney

567
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,072
There aren't enough

568
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:47,168
Jorge

569
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:52,544
Evil lawyer joke that is my decision and other

570
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,896
Mark and I are you know not to compare myself to the great Mark Bankston but

571
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:00,992
You know I think that we engage with the law and a very similar way

572
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,784
And

573
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,856
Yeah it's just okay well

574
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:10,720
Here's the heart of a matter and here's what it is and we should do what's fair and what's right

575
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:11,744
And

576
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,024
You should not reward p

577
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:13,792
People who

578
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,072
You know consistent Libre

579
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:15,840
Break the rules

580
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:21,984
It's just basic stuff when you when you when you take a look at it at maybe I just

581
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,128
It's been brought up a Venn diagram but when you take a look at what has David ultimately strangely enough brought us all

582
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:28,896
Together

583
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:37,600
And the all of the lawyers in yourself and everybody

584
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,368
Is

585
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,160
Is the thing that

586
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,440
Drives us

587
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,208
Switches that

588
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,000
This s*** is unfair

589
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,280
This is wrong

590
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:48,864
And at the end of the day all of us I feel like are just

591
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,912
Unable to

592
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,448
To not watch that

593
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,728
In the same way that

594
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,032
Everybody looks at us and goes it at

595
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,056
Get your insane

596
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:00,128
For recording 705i episodes

597
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:04,480
I'm sure people look at you and say you're insane for watching all of these hearings

598
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:09,088
Or and I know it drove Mark and saying to watch all of that Infowars

599
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,696
That's what it is it's it's this is unfair

600
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:19,328
This is bulshit oh yeah do I truly have had that thought of you know

601
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,608
Am I

602
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:25,216
Am I the crazy one and then I'll see Norman be like you know at least I'm not doing that

603
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:31,104
Bright and I did listen to an episode of norms podcast for V

604
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,504
It was all know I've ever had to do for work I got to say

605
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:44,160
And I used to work at a combination Quiznos Baskin-Robbins in a gas station in Mississippi so

606
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,976
You know take that for what you will

607
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,144
Those are the most terrifying words anybody's ever spoken to me

608
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,496
Mississippi to Maine and it would be slightly more terrified

609
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:01,056
It was very

610
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:03,104
Surprisingly

611
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:06,432
But if you made it for Southern Gothic

612
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:09,760
But I guess I think that does Sprint

613
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:12,064
These things are what he know does drawers be

614
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,832
Because you know what

615
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,368
Tomorrow Queen

616
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,648
People like me it's

617
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:19,232
What ultimately drove me into law school

618
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,048
Is that at the end of the day I was always a kid

619
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,632
You know what he would say to your parents that's not fair

620
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,656
And I'd say 12

621
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,472
And I would respond

622
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,240
Why isn't

623
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,360
And nobody knew what the state about you know like you don't exactly

624
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:40,224
Kind of disturbing to hear from a child if I'm being honest but

625
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:44,576
I probably lost all my serotonin by the time I was ten so

626
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,880
But it's fine so yeah

627
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:51,744
I I got it way more trouble with that question

628
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,792
I think it was a t

629
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,560
Futuristic

630
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,328
To bake

631
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:58,656
And they said you know life is not fair

632
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,448
I said something along the lines of

633
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:03,008
Well then why aren't you doing anything about it

634
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:09,152
And that got me in real trouble because it can makes you confront that like why am I not doing anything about it and

635
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:12,480
Exactly going to be his hearings or without I'm not acting like that

636
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:13,504
Leonardo

637
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,296
Substantively changing things

638
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,832
But I have been able

639
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,856
To help promote

640
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,392
Happy family stories I have been able

641
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,696
I didn't think anybody would

642
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:25,024
What are you know what I was going to live-tweet like maybe one day

643
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,328
If somebody out there found it you

644
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,352
Useful I was going to come

645
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:30,912
Continue it but it turns out a bunch of people have

646
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,472
You know found value in it

647
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:39,872
Some people have even found we've all appreciated that I followed along with

648
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,896
With your tweets

649
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,920
As well you know

650
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,200
It's it's

651
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:47,040
It is I don't want to say impossible

652
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:51,904
But it is extremely difficult for me to watch a legal thing

653
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,440
What happened

654
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:55,488
Without like screaming at

655
00:30:55,744 --> 00:31:00,864
At the judge wearing a robe I just thought you know it's all the sudden in my head I'll be like

656
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,984
Why are you wearing a robe this is the Matrix this is all a simulation you don't like I do it'll lose

657
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,312
I'll lose my mind so hopefully what you do

658
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,872
I think we should have shorts and courtroom

659
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,968
I think that need to be venex

660
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,552
The next cause I take up

661
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,464
I don't I don't know why that got me but whatever whenever she was like

662
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:30,560
And I saw somebody wearing shorts today and we do not wear shorts in my courtroom

663
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,608
I couldn't understand life

664
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:34,144
For like an hour

665
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:37,728
With this is just a room

666
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:41,056
What are we doing here is a lie

667
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:47,968
Services a courtroom

668
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:53,344
Going to be the problem when it comes to justice is that would happen

669
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,904
This is your being dragged out

670
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:59,232
Well exactly that's that's enough

671
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:06,656
Speaking of speaking of that you also understand that that is doing a lot of work in that

672
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,960
I mean speaking of

673
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:13,568
Lawyers being trouble you followed along with right now

674
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,872
Disciplinary hearing to write

675
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,664
Yes to an extent

676
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,712
Although it's been

677
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,016
It's been very muddy today

678
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:28,928
Everybody has been money that's all

679
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:33,024
Newman Normand you know what happens where and it's just

680
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:36,608
Yeah I I'm not sure exactly

681
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,632
What

682
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,936
Got one I have not been following as

683
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:40,704
Closely

684
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:41,984
But

685
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:45,568
I did find so far for the last Texas

686
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:50,688
Trial as well get a rental has his own attorney which is never a good situation when you haven't

687
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,712
Nesting doll of attorney

688
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:55,808
You know attorney with an attorney is always felt

689
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:58,624
Wrong to me like yeah I don't know why

690
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:04,000
Yeah it's I mean I would never represent myself a say a lawyer who represents

691
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,536
Some cells has a full for client

692
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,304
But

693
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,352
But also Infowars

694
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,376
Has has

695
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,936
A new attorney that they debuted at that

696
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:15,008
Hearing his name is actually Chris Martin

697
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:18,336
It's not the lead singer from Coldplay

698
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:22,944
But again there's like seven people in the world so honestly like who

699
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:28,064
Who's to say this how do you how do you take that job now

700
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:34,464
How do I just take that job now you you are a person who is taking law jobs

701
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,280
Is right at no point in time have you watched

702
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:42,400
The most disgusting display of legal hatred

703
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,448
That's ever been gone on a bit like gas

704
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,264
That's my next gig right what is happening

705
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:53,152
Yes it was Christopher Martin he is representing Infowars but they said when all when he sent

706
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,944
He's at a bit last Texas hearing

707
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:59,040
Reynolds said he is still the attorney on the Posner in Fontaine case

708
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,064
So

709
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,904
I'm not sure exactly what's all going on there but I suspect that there will be

710
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,672
Be some kind of dish

711
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:07,744
Disciplinary action toward probably Normandin all at this

712
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,560
Particularly with the Saints

713
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,120
Behavior

714
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:19,520
All that just what what you know I've heard I've heard sections and I understand sanctions

715
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,800
Meme

716
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,080
Money right

717
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:24,128
So sometimes they do so

718
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,920
One of the first things I did work

719
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,968
With Andrew is actually got sanctions again

720
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,504
Another attorney which I was

721
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,552
Brand new out of law school so that way

722
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,576
What is a band practice

723
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,624
I'll probably longer than I've been alive

724
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,392
But

725
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:43,328
So you got your first taste of blood on day one yes what was the

726
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:49,984
The Vampire Diaries quiz your blade

727
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,848
The lawyers are vampires in your a vampire that hunts vampires this makes perfect sense.

728
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,384
I understand everything.

729
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:02,784
Yeah and I don't necessarily enjoy like I don't want to go I'm not saying that every attorney is like

730
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,672
And every attorneys bad it or bad I even like pursuing but there are particular attorneys who are truly just being

731
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,952
Absolutely Wild

732
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:13,536
You need to call hyperbolic

733
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:16,352
Speeches by stock-in-trade so nobody's

734
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,144
W2 concern

735
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,544
Well I'm always and you know I I've been labeled a Firebrand in the in the past which you know some people say that's a bad

736
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,408
And I always take it as a compliment means I'm passionate and good label are about my clients

737
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,176
But

738
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:35,296
Yeah so he is again yeah judge Maya even pointed this out and said

739
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,576
You are 26

740
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,600
Teeth lawyer

741
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,416
To enter an appearance in this case

742
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,976
I thought she was exaggerating no

743
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,768
He is the 16th lawyer

744
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,048
And he did

745
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:50,656
He at that hearing did not know if he was going to be joining run all on that

746
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,192
On the pasta Infante

747
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,216
Cases

748
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,752
And so I was like

749
00:35:55,008 --> 00:36:01,152
So what does that mean is that is there a possible 17th lawyer that my enter into this thing and judge my even said when he

750
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,688
He said yes I'm aware I'm like this

751
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,808
She said well you know what they say about being the third or fourth lawyer on a case

752
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:12,928
Right like like why would you do this

753
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:19,584
To yourself to get out of what they say about being the 16th lawyer on the case though is we've got a great baseball team

754
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,656
And we're really going to take it to the other associates

755
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:25,728
So you know there's two ways to go on this

756
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:32,128
Yeah it reminds me of you know a scene from Arrested Development where they talk about you know and open bear

757
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,664
Opening up a marriage

758
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,712
Buyasession riverworks

759
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,736
But it might work

760
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:37,504
For us

761
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:40,576
And so I'm imagining so with your lawyer saying

762
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,368
I did work for bed

763
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,904
Maybe I can do it

764
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,696
Bright

765
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:49,280
Right when you're watching this this lawyer talk to the judge

766
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:52,096
Can you see sense of

767
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,400
Dread or Zayed like

768
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:59,776
I couldn't go into that situation without feeling like there's a Sword of Damocles literally hanging over

769
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:02,592
Right I'm the 16th lawyer I'm like

770
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,616
Henry the 8th

771
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,640
9th wife

772
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,920
It's not going to go well

773
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:08,224
You know exactly I was

774
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,272
You know I a binky button

775
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,064
Attorneys

776
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,088
Basin and

777
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:13,856
Bellaire West

778
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,624
Balling

779
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,160
In Ferrari all them were even

780
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,464
Shiocton

781
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,744
You know them bringing in

782
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,280
16th lawyer now

783
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:26,144
You know who is honestly I'm kind of shocked Alex hasn't asked me in this

784
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:32,288
I would do a better job but I know everything about these cases because I've been to every hearing

785
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:38,688
You know cuz I'll at you know it's funny whenever he'll have a you know lawyer that's like oh well you know I need to get caught

786
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:43,040
What up on everything and it's like wow I'm caught up and I'm not even doing this for a living

787
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:49,440
Which I didn't like showhome case better than you do and I have proof I have no

788
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:51,232
Again yui sword of how

789
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,768
You know maybe you might

790
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,560
Has a bit deranged

791
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:59,168
But I mean I found it useful and also midnight owl so I do my day job at night and

792
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,728
You know I and I just thought this was important

793
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,264
And I knew that people were going to

794
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,824
Screw it up when they talked about this and I think that this

795
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,848
This is a case that is

796
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,152
Really setting valuable precedent

797
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,712
I think that there are ways

798
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,736
Is that we can tackle

799
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:13,760
Disinformation

800
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:17,344
And believable world and I actually think this is a really good way to do

801
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:18,624
Because V

802
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,648
Ennis you know

803
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,696
These people who aren't public

804
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,488
Figures are now being you know dragged up

805
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:26,560
Dragged through the mud by B's badass

806
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:30,912
And anyhow it is about time somebody stood up and

807
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:33,216
Do something and say this is enough

808
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:37,056
It is a horrible process and I would understand why somebody would

809
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:37,824
Choose not to purr

810
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,872
Pursue that because I mean you seen how

811
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:42,176
Long this is going and how he's doing the bankruptcy

812
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:42,944
Shenanigans

813
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:43,968
Everything but

814
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,296
You don't know but eventually somebody's got to stand up to a bully

815
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,832
Which is what Infowars is

816
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,856
Send what a lot of these

817
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,416
Disinformation Outlets are

818
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,952
Bear bear bully

819
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,232
They're trying to

820
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:56,768
Cause people to be

821
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,048
Be harassed or trying to

822
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,072
Money off of

823
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,352
Hatred and a

824
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,632
Anger and Division

825
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:02,912
It's you know

826
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:09,312
Somebody Auto somebody ought to do something about that as I as I say and what we've said it we've said

827
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,616
Time and time again.

828
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,152
One of the things that we do

829
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,944
Despise the most about

830
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,224
A lot of the

831
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,504
The coverage of

832
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,040
That the trials are

833
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:19,808
Regarding

834
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,088
Sandy Hook families

835
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,904
That that simple sentence of like

836
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:30,304
The families are looking for 500 million dollars or something that the families are requesting $500 or something

837
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,072
Sing like that

838
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,864
And it is

839
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:39,520
Just such a simple signal that is just wrong which is there they're not requesting money at all

840
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,568
They're stopping this guy

841
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:46,944
You need them stopped and I need them stopped and they're doing that and money is how it happen

842
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:51,040
That's like it that's like saying you know the money is the sword

843
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,320
In this situation

844
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:55,648
Not something that they're requesting from

845
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:59,232
Yeah and it and that is that is it in

846
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,000
Interesting way a

847
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,024
To frame it

848
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:01,792
In that

849
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:03,072
You-do-it internet

850
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,096
It's not about the money

851
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:04,864
And

852
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:07,168
There's been people that have said

853
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:09,472
Things like oh well you know they sued

854
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:13,824
This person and that person and Albert Sue and Alex

855
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,152
I've seen comments at people's made about

856
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,200
Oh this is too far over this is

857
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:21,248
Greedy and the thing about it is

858
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,528
Yeah you're going to ask

859
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,832
Because you're probably not going to get what you asked

860
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:25,600
Or also

861
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:32,512
You're always in negotiation starting with I'll give you money that's not how that works

862
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,280
Exactly

863
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,560
And Anubis

864
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:38,144
With this Casey how you you are absolutely going to start off high

865
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,424
I and

866
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,960
The fact is like it's obvious

867
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:44,800
It shouldn't be these families are requesting money it should lead with how to

868
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:47,616
Speakable his behavior has been and that he needs to

869
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,384
To be held to a

870
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,152
Account

871
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,968
That's what you said I counted

872
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:53,504
Money is a way to we get to

873
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,272
Accountability

874
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,040
But you know there was this

875
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,064
Discussion of

876
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,344
Oh well

877
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,904
Ignore me then kind of hinted at this

878
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,672
And his argument

879
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:01,696
Well

880
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,976
No amount of money

881
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,512
To compensate for

882
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,048
The pain

883
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,072
And

884
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:10,656
It's like yes man but you know what that's what we have

885
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:16,288
We Can't Stop racing time and make Alex go undo the damage he did and I don't

886
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,336
I think he would if he was presented with that off

887
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:25,760
I don't think he wouldn't years ago we put you in the stocks and throw things at you but we don't do that anymore so you

888
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:26,784
You always money

889
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,576
Exactly that's what that's

890
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,856
Injustice that we have

891
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,928
And yes it is kind of weird and nebulous

892
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:36,768
When you start asking people okay I sounded dollar value to

893
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:41,376
You know pain and suffering because again those are abstract Concepts in your asking

894
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,168
Someone to put a concrete number

895
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:48,288
And yeah it does get it does get very weird and fuzzy and you know

896
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,872
Very philosophical and even esoteric they are but

897
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,407
That's what we have

898
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:57,759
And so does idea that these families are just out there trying to get money

899
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:00,831
It is absolutely ridiculous when really the story

900
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,855
Leading should be

901
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,903
This is what this man did today

902
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,951
This is what suffering that he

903
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,999
And he knew he was cause

904
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:10,303
And he did all of this so he could sell

905
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,351
It's

906
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,423
Yeah and so he could perpetuate his weird world

907
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,727
Yeah

908
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:21,823
I didn't enter you're absolutely right as far as the

909
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:22,591
The directions

910
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,359
Things are going

911
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:25,407
When you when you talk about how

912
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,175
These

913
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:26,943
People

914
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:27,711
Somebody needs to

915
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:28,479
To stand up to this

916
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,247
Is bullying you know

917
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,015
For the past

918
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,807
20 years there's been nothing

919
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,343
But positive reinforce

920
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,367
From

921
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:37,951
Fox News and right-wing media in general in regards

922
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:43,583
Just bully people bullying that's what people want they want that aggressive

923
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,351
Kind of

924
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,887
Attack on

925
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:47,935
And

926
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:48,959
This may be

927
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,007
One of the few times that any of us

928
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,567
Possible serious

929
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,591
Princess brautigan

930
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:57,151
I think it might be the first time Alex

931
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,431
Experiencing serious

932
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:01,247
Quinces and I think that we're seeing

933
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,039
You do a repeated what happened

934
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:06,623
It's right that that y'all have covered you know whenever his dad would get him out of

935
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:07,647
Apple right

936
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:11,231
I think that this is a large case of that I saw that one of the Truss

937
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,023
That apparent

938
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,047
We paid his bank

939
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,071
See lawyer

940
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,095
Believers personal

941
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,655
I have reason to believe that his dad

942
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,447
Not so

943
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,263
Yeah so

944
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:29,919
I did I mean ironically one of the most damning things that was said at the trial though came from his dad which II

945
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,455
Appreciate on

946
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:34,015
On a Shakespearean level

947
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:38,111
This man has gotten him out of trouble over and over and over again

948
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,391
And yet with one sentence

949
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:43,231
Put a nail in the coffin is what he said

950
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:46,303
I I got up I think I got up and cheered

951
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:49,119
When he said and I definition tape

952
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,911
We try to

953
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:55,007
You know it see what Alex was saying on that day we try to emulate spikes

954
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:58,335
I was already said that

955
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,711
That is a moment Inouye

956
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:05,759
The trial moment with with Mark

957
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:09,855
Well will live on forever as as one of the Great

958
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:10,623
La Mona

959
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:13,183
But that moment whenever Alex

960
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:13,951
Texas dad

961
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,231
I mean it was

962
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:17,023
It was borderline

963
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:20,095
You know you can't handle the truth levels

964
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:20,863
To Otis

965
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:27,519
I mean honestly you a time I don't know how if I was doing a case like that and that was to my advantage

966
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:31,103
I think I would have somehow done a backflip in

967
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:36,991
Decor and I cannot do a backflip I would have somehow figured it out I would have Mary Lou Retton all over that place

968
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:39,039
I would not be able to control myself

969
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:44,671
That's it that's really that's really interesting cuz that brings me to the next question I have written down

970
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:51,071
Have you ever done a backflip in court no I feel like it would be frowned upon you know

971
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:57,727
I do I have not Hail Marys though that is that it's always worth it ain't you know I would have my favorite ways to win

972
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,775
That is you know when that when the judge will say

973
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,567
The equivalent of

974
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:04,383
You're being wild right now Stringer

975
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:08,479
But you got a boy

976
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:11,039
Sober

977
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:13,087
But yeah I'm

978
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,647
I'm so thankful that I got

979
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:17,439
2B you know even

980
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:19,231
The small part that I got to

981
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,511
Play here

982
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:23,071
I've really enjoyed being able to

983
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:24,607
Elevator

984
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,911
Family stories and talk about them and

985
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:29,471
You know their testimony cuz that's something also I thought that way

986
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,239
It was really important

987
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,007
Going to do is

988
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:31,775
Is 2

989
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,055
Talk about the testimony be

990
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,335
Family talk about what they

991
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:37,151
What the harm was done

992
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,943
I think in that context again

993
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:39,967
Story isn't

994
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,735
That they're asking for

995
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,015
Her mom Eva story is

996
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:43,807
Good God

997
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:48,415
Whitney Blake is it this is most evil and when the most evil cases I've ever seen

998
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:50,975
It is

999
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:52,255
Especially when you compare

1000
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,279
Hobby family

1001
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,047
You have

1002
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:54,815
Made

1003
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:55,839
Positive

1004
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,143
Contribute good in the

1005
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:01,983
When they have every reason to say f*** off to everybody

1006
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:03,519
Everywhere

1007
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,567
And

1008
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,615
India pay still manage

1009
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,383
2

1010
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:09,663
B+

1011
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:10,943
And try to bring light

1012
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:11,967
And try to

1013
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:12,991
Be a better

1014
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,015
Horse in the world

1015
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:14,783
For good

1016
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:19,647
And then when you compare that with you know the greed and awfulness and hatred of Alex

1017
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:22,463
You know it is honestly astonished

1018
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:27,071
No it's it's almost comically

1019
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,119
Pause

1020
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,655
Of Good and Evil

1021
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,471
It's it's so Stark

1022
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,263
That it makes you question

1023
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,031
Yourself big

1024
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,055
Real life is

1025
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:37,823
Never this

1026
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:41,407
And it is and I think that you find out a lot in litigation

1027
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:45,503
Sunday night as I say the truth is somewhere in the middle right I mean sometimes you'll have

1028
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:52,671
It is very often be a case where both sides are making good points I mean that's why you're litigating otherwise somebody with a

1029
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:53,439
Previously settled

1030
00:46:54,207 --> 00:47:00,351
But it's a completely you know right if it were if it were easy we wouldn't f****** be here that

1031
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,887
That's number one yeah

1032
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,423
And so I

1033
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:05,215
Yeah it I feel like

1034
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:07,263
You so rarely get those kinds of

1035
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,311
Oceans and I do feel like

1036
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,335
This case is going

1037
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:12,383
Set a precedent you know I think Norm is

1038
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:16,479
Right in that aspect and that Liars are going to be taken to account

1039
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,015
People who break the rules and

1040
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,807
Used to participate there going to be

1041
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:20,831
Be held to account

1042
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:21,599
And people are going to

1043
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,367
Point to this case

1044
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,159
And

1045
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:27,231
I get it I know that the facts of his case or really you know

1046
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,255
Daycare so

1047
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,303
But I'm hoping that this isn't

1048
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:31,839
But I'm hoping that

1049
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,375
Can build into

1050
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:34,655
Where we are take

1051
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:35,935
These people who

1052
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,215
Perpetuate this amount

1053
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:38,239
Carlmont of the world

1054
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,311
You know you should not be able to lie

1055
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:44,127
About people in the most horrendous of ways

1056
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,151
Is and make money for

1057
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,175
I feel like that's

1058
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:46,943
Very

1059
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:47,967
Simple

1060
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:50,527
And yet everyone thinks of him

1061
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:53,855
What's so crazy about it is that you have to say it

1062
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,647
That's that shitt

1063
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:59,743
But you should not be able to do that that shouldn't exist is a sin

1064
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,023
In English right

1065
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:07,935
I mean 48 it is but when you say it like that then I feel like people understand more what

1066
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,215
This is really about

1067
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:12,799
This is about someone taking you know the most

1068
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,591
Personal aspect

1069
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:15,615
Someone's life

1070
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,383
Especially

1071
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:17,407
Grieving

1072
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:18,943
You know the death of a love

1073
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,735
And the death of a child

1074
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,295
Absolutely

1075
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:25,087
And

1076
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,367
Profiting for

1077
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,391
And it's

1078
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:29,951
I think that concept of itself is just

1079
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,975
So gross

1080
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,535
And I think you do I feel like

1081
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34,303
Maybe

1082
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:36,095
I don't know if you and Dan felt and

1083
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:39,679
Situation but sometimes being worried about the jury being red pills

1084
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:40,703
Or

1085
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,775
Yeah yeah yeah

1086
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:49,663
There was there were plenty of times where you know when when the jury has Quest

1087
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,199
Every time the jury

1088
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:52,735
Comes back with question

1089
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:55,295
There's the I think the the natural ends

1090
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,087
To try and overanalyze

1091
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,135
Why they would ask this

1092
00:48:59,391 --> 00:48:59,903
Ticular question

1093
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,439
See if that gives a

1094
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,975
Insight into what they may be thinking

1095
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:04,255
You know Adam

1096
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,791
And so there were a few

1097
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:10,399
It made me think there were at least one or two people who

1098
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:13,215
Hi I was not stoked about being

1099
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,263
If that makes sense

1100
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:19,103
Yeah that happened to me too and that's when I had to remember they might be

1101
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,407
Beat right cuz you know they're also not allowed to talk to

1102
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,687
To each other so they may be

1103
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:25,247
Be trying to illustrate a point for other jurors

1104
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:31,391
Or to clarify for her own sales and I think the guy that was asking is if Dario was a lizard

1105
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:35,231
Person was just having fun

1106
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:41,375
Sure you do you say that

1107
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:45,983
But I think that you don't because we are so close and we see

1108
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,543
Do CDs radicalized

1109
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,567
People in out

1110
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,335
What is audience

1111
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,103
Steven

1112
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,895
You know outside of Alex's audio

1113
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,431
The concern of course is

1114
00:49:54,943 --> 00:50:00,063
Oh my gosh everybody around me is like completely radicalized and then

1115
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,623
Anybody else is just not paying attention

1116
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:04,671
And that's a huge problem

1117
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:07,743
And we need to fix it and I feel like

1118
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:09,023
This really gave

1119
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:11,583
Restored a lot of My Hope and a lot of ways

1120
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:12,863
Where

1121
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,143
People said no

1122
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:16,191
This is disgusting and wrong

1123
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,495
I don't have to know everything about Alex

1124
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:19,263
Jones Center

1125
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:25,919
And that's almost more importantly they don't know everything about Alex

1126
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,455
Like to me

1127
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:29,247
Part of the the jury's

1128
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,295
A verdict in the way that

1129
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:35,647
Restore my you know similarly I had restored faith in Indy

1130
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:36,415
Humanity

1131
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,695
Is is that

1132
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:38,975
Without

1133
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,767
The constant

1134
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,047
Phresher

1135
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:45,631
The of Alex's Media or Fox News or who

1136
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,399
Whomever

1137
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,423
Coloring

1138
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:49,215
The way you think about

1139
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:52,031
In a in a neutral setting

1140
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,335
Every human being

1141
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,359
Can come to the

1142
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,895
Conclusion that Alex is an ass

1143
00:50:57,919 --> 00:51:01,503
That's what was so beautiful about it you know he is legally an a******

1144
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:02,783
It's

1145
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:03,807
Yeah if

1146
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:11,743
Autocomplete Covington Tennessee gas so I was going to say and it just at that that really helped

1147
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:14,815
With and I think that the similar thing happened with the midterm

1148
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:15,583
I think that

1149
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:19,167
It's you do an understated argument for somebody to go

1150
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,703
Hey look at this f****** weirdo

1151
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:25,311
I feel like that was actually defective

1152
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:30,687
Argument against people like Blake Masters and these weirdos and you know the fact that we're always like

1153
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:34,271
Oh man everybody's just f****** pilled of a gills and it's like

1154
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:36,319
Yeah my phone number country

1155
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:41,183
But it is and that's definitely something to watch and something to be worried about but

1156
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:43,231
Most of the country is like

1157
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:45,023
These people suck

1158
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:51,679
What the heck even talkin about half the time

1159
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,215
Took

1160
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:53,983
Listen

1161
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,519
Herschel Walker

1162
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:58,079
Still almost 18 took

1163
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:01,151
The single least qualified

1164
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:03,967
Most hypocritical

1165
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:07,551
Political candidate in the history of the I think the world

1166
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:10,879
To lose a republican race in Georgia

1167
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:12,927
Yeah that that did that

1168
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:19,071
I mean that still is complete I said that's still concerning but at least you know all is not lost

1169
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:21,631
You know everybody

1170
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:28,287
All is not lost because at least these people you know are are really thinking about the issues I did love how judge Bell

1171
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:30,847
Was so thankful to the jury though

1172
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:33,663
She kept calling him a very conscientious jewelry

1173
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:38,015
And noting how much they were on time and everything and people were asking me you know.

1174
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:44,927
Are Judges usually like them to reason like I don't mind cuz you be shot

1175
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:48,767
I was supposed to be here today

1176
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:56,447
Sure I mean you think of I think most people would think of courtrooms because they do

1177
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,727
Do their best to avoid them

1178
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:00,031
As places of almost soup

1179
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,311
Supreme solemnity

1180
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:06,687
So it makes sense to them to think of all the Jerry's always on time they're always on time in the movie

1181
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:08,991
You know but didn't realize that

1182
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:12,831
Jury duty so up when I show up

1183
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:16,159
Vibrate

1184
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,183
So

1185
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:24,095
Yeah but I think that judge Bell is really hit the nail on the head because they were like I saw that there were jurors that were

1186
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:24,863
Engaged

1187
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:25,631
They were

1188
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:29,215
You know I could see where people were taking notes and of course you know

1189
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:33,311
It's very funny that was happening the Connecticut case to as well as a Texas

1190
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:36,895
Case where one jar jar is trying to take notes on

1191
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,943
Soma calyxes saying and

1192
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:39,711
In a table

1193
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,759
The Infowars broadcast

1194
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:43,039
And they just give up

1195
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:47,391
Yeah it's impossible to follow and that that really

1196
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:48,671
You know

1197
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:51,999
And I felt like a lot a lot of people were

1198
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:53,791
Worried that they were

1199
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:54,559
Would come pay wouldn't

1200
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:55,583
Can grass be important

1201
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,607
Sabetha penguin grass

1202
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:00,191
Oh yeah he did some bad stuff but I mean

1203
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,215
We shouldn't be

1204
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:03,007
You know solely held

1205
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,799
Responsible or he shouldn't be that was

1206
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:08,383
Go for it I was really worried about that but I think in both cases

1207
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,663
Now we've seen where

1208
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,199
The jury has

1209
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,735
That's really really thought about the

1210
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:14,527
And

1211
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:16,063
Given their not you know

1212
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:17,599
And I think also

1213
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,367
They

1214
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,135
Don't like

1215
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:21,439
The argument that Reynaldo and dorm

1216
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:22,463
I put forward

1217
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:24,255
Cuz also it treats them like they're

1218
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,023
Stupid

1219
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:28,607
I've also never seen cases where your jury

1220
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:29,375
That

1221
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:31,423
That the defendant

1222
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,703
Called you dumb

1223
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:36,031
Again

1224
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:43,967
But why do you think we're all blue-collar hear what the what the f*** is that about excuse me sir

1225
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:50,367
Jury is in a regular Daria saying that she believes that it's a simulation to Annex

1226
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,135
Sad

1227
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,927
Yeah

1228
00:54:53,951 --> 00:55:00,095
Home adwent when she when she said that to the most basic jury question like which I think was a question that was mess

1229
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,887
Turn on the degree of you know

1230
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:04,959
Are you a lizard person in there like a do you think that

1231
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:09,567
You know this trial is staged then when she was like yeah to an extent I was just like

1232
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:10,591
Oh man

1233
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,151
That was yeah.

1234
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,967
Teresa gave some of the greats

1235
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,295
She's going to go on unsung

1236
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:21,599
I think in the history books for how

1237
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:24,159
Absolutely insane she was in that trial

1238
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:27,743
There were so many moments where she agreed to something

1239
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:30,559
That you were you looked at her dead in the eyes

1240
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:33,631
Just thought if I were bleeding out she would laugh

1241
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:35,423
Like she has gotten

1242
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,191
Nothing

1243
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:40,031
Or would refuse to answer the most basic questions

1244
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:46,431
12 year old who's getting detention like I'm not answering it

1245
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:49,247
Or you know it's

1246
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:53,855
Not answering was the was the main goal of everybody at in Fort Worth

1247
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:58,975
Is it felt like it did feel like that I mean I'm and I think that's also by Design

1248
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:03,839
Find write you you know what the Brittany pause situation I think it was very much by Design hey

1249
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:05,631
Only let her know these things

1250
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:08,447
Even if she asked about x y and z

1251
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,471
Let's not tell her

1252
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:10,239
Right

1253
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:15,615
Right right there very much was that I've also never seen a

1254
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:19,199
Random criminal defense attorney service a corporate representative

1255
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:25,343
I've seen things in these cases I I don't think I

1256
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,135
I don't think two instead will

1257
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,671
Probably see you again

1258
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:36,351
I'm proud to say that we are the the reason that Britney pauses bro

1259
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:39,423
Because of well I guess that this

1260
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:44,543
I guess my wife tweeting and coming on now has officially maybe part of a knowledge fight Cottage

1261
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:45,567
Mystery

1262
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:52,223
Yeah see there you go you're a bottom feeder just like us welcome to the club

1263
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:53,247
You know its first

1264
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:56,831
Oh

1265
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:57,855
Oh man that was

1266
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:04,767
Again again I ended up something that also I don't I'm like if the plaintiffs attorneys are aware of me and you know and I'm

1267

Tubi

1282
00:57:59,039 --> 00:57:59,551
The writing on that

1283
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:02,111
I'm in the middle of a move

1284
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:02,879
So it's been

1285
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,159

Excellent Bell it because of my Southern

1302
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:43,071
My very thick southern accent

1303
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:44,095
Which I'm sure you've met

1304
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:50,751
Don't don't don't look up Ace Attorney that one's on me that was a huge mistake

1305
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:55,103
I feel like kind of rings better but

1306
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:57,151
Sounds good

1307
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:58,687
You can feel it

1308
00:58:58,943 --> 00:58:59,711
Sawyer

1309
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:04,319
So yes before before we go I do want to ask you

1310
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:08,927
5 people one of the questions that people to ask us all the

1311
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:09,951
The time after

1312
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:11,487
6 years of

1313
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:12,767
This nonsense

1314
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:15,071
How do you feel like a defect

1315
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,095
Did you as

1316
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:17,375
A person in the way

1317
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:18,143
You think about that

1318
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:21,471
And I was wondering the the same for you because

1319
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:26,847
When you immerse yourself in this kind of space the way that we have done it

1320
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:27,871
It does change

1321
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:33,247
So I was wondering what kind of feelings that are what kind of feeling of change do you have

1322
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:34,783
That's it

1323
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:35,807
Yeah but

1324
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:36,575
That's a good question

1325
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:37,599
And so I

1326
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:42,719
You do not to be thank you to be so it is even asked very good questions but this is

1327
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:43,999
A very very thoughtful

1328
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:45,791
I

1329
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:49,375
I would actually say not to be corny about it

1330
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:56,031
But I would say it actually has I feel like made me a better lawyer and a better Communicator with

1331
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:56,799
How

1332
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,079
I talked about the law with

1333
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:02,687
Because that's something I've I've actually even discovered I have a real passion

1334
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:05,503
Is telling people about what's going on in these

1335
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:06,527
Types of cases

1336
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,831
Providing some sort of an owl

1337
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,623
I mean I don't know nothing

1338
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:11,647
It's early what that mean

1339
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:12,415
But also its

1340
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:13,951
And the fact that

1341
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:14,975
I was

1342
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,255
You know very

1343
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:17,535
Responded about

1344
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,559
The state of

1345
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,327
Legal

1346
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,119
And

1347
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:21,887
You know thinking

1348
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:24,447
It it seems like all these

1349
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,215
There's

1350
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:26,751
Just so many grifters and illegal

1351
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:29,823
Super fashion and it feels like the only way to get ahead is to

1352
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:30,847
To be one of these despicable

1353
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:31,871
People

1354
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:33,151
And here I am

1355
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:35,455
Refusing but you know there's no

1356
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:39,295
I felt like there was there was like no advantage

1357
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:40,831
Professional unless

1358
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:44,671
I'm honestly I started

1359
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,207
Ghetto trying to

1360
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:48,767
Sebastian.

1361
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:51,327
And I

1362
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,095
I still am

1363
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,119
Hopefully always

1364
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,143
Will be

1365
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:54,911
But

1366
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,191
I

1367
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:59,263
Yeah I feel like I have gotten

1368
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,287
Hope again

1369
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:01,567
And that there are good at

1370
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:03,871
That there are attorneys

1371
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:05,151
Care about

1372
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:08,479
And there are Judges

1373
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:09,247
To care about what

1374
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,015
Behringer

1375
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:10,783
Justice and

1376
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:11,551
And doing the right

1377
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,319
Right thing

1378
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,343
And holding pee

1379
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,135
And there are jury

1380
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:15,903
The people who made up

1381
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:16,671
Madhuri's you know

1382
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:18,975
Boohoo

1383
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:20,767
Say no this is wrong

1384
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,047
And also about

1385
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:22,815
Punisher

1386
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:24,095
That we are now punishing

1387
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,143
Who break the rules

1388
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:27,423
Are grifters

1389
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:29,471
I feel like that has

1390
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,239
Change and

1391
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,007
Made me a lot more

1392
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:32,543
About this

1393
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,335
That I'm actually seeing

1394
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:35,103
Consequences

1395
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:36,383
How far of a bat

1396
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:38,175
Where's it felt like

1397
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:38,943
Before

1398
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:39,711
They seem to

1399
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:40,479
To be the ones

1400
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:41,759
Advantage while every

1401
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:43,039
Everybody else was yeah

1402
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:45,599
I feel like my faith in the legal depression

1403
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:50,719
The legal depression

1404
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:57,375
I was about to say that is one of the most inspiring speeches I've ever heard until you ended it with legal depression.

1405
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:05,311
What is a Bill Pullman made us love in Independence Day we're not remembering that speech right there aliens

1406
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,079
Kill us all

1407
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:08,127
Iraq

1408
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:20,927
Crushing it you were right it higher the store

1409
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:27,327
Good feeling

1410
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:33,727
There's that there's a reason the words are similar

1411
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:37,055
But I feel like my faith in the

1412
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,079
Profession has been

1413
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:41,151
Restored in the fact that people are interested in hearing

1414
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:43,711
About what the families are saying

1415
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:44,735
And

1416
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:47,039
What in visit just about

1417
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:53,439
Oh Alex comes in and it explodes on the stand and then we all make memes and laugh and then forget about how

1418
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,207
Evil he is

1419
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:54,975
That's right

1420
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:58,303
Which I mean we don't have fun and I mean that's fine at the end of a day but

1421
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,863
He does his weird Highwayman DJ

1422
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,399
Stop and throw hatchets

1423
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:04,191
Well he's drinking in the office

1424
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:08,543
Christmas Eve right but at the end of the day it is

1425
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,335
The bankruptcy goes away

1426
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,103
I want you

1427
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:15,967
Will say but I hope I can get one of those

1428
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:20,063
That's all I ask but that might be a big

1429
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:25,183
That's that I don't know I think he had to sell that on account of it was

1430
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:28,255
Two little man it wasn't manly enough for

1431
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:29,791
His rationale

1432
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,095
Oh yeah it's it's

1433
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,143
Governor real man

1434
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:35,167
But

1435
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:40,799
Yeah yeah that is that is one of the things that we respect the most about

1436
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:42,079
You and I

1437
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,127
The people that we've

1438
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,151
Surrounded myself

1439
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,431
Is the

1440
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:48,223
The need to put

1441
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:49,759
The families first

1442
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:51,551
To put the harm first

1443
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,855
And we can all have our fun

1444
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:56,159
After that but not

1445
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,695
To forget that

1446
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:59,487
The reason we're here

1447
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:01,279
AZ is because of this

1448
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,047
Do you know

1449
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:06,143
Yes exactly it's a remember okay well you know yeah he

1450
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,423
Is he says funny

1451
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,959
Stop on the stand we can all make

1452
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:09,983
Make fun of him

1453
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,007
Of course but

1454
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:15,103
You know but that yeah but that we don't lead off with

1455
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:17,407
Right that we instead say

1456
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,943
Oh this is Bihar but

1457
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,223
He is dying to

1458
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,015
Society 2

1459
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:23,039
Ace family

1460
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:24,063
He's too you know

1461
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,855
The people who know these four

1462
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:29,183
You know it it's

1463
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:30,463
Again I'll trauma just

1464
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,231
Kind of

1465
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:32,255
Does itself and get

1466
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:33,279
Down in thing

1467
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:34,559
That's something I also

1468
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,351
The degree of harm.

1469
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,119
Really this has

1470
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:40,447
It's true it's true in imaginable

1471
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:42,239
So when you think about that way

1472
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:43,263
You do 8

1473
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:46,591
It doesn't make the money seem as overwhelming and large

1474
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:47,359
I mean

1475
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,383
You almost do get

1476
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:49,663
Situation where you're like

1477
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:50,943
Man is it

1478
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:51,711
You know

1479
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:53,247
Is this even enough

1480
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:54,015
But

1481
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:56,319
Time will tell with that but

1482
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:03,743
See where it goes I mean you you you think about the is this enough and what one of the powerful things that

1483
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:04,767
Did they kept bringing up with

1484
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,303
How many people were

1485
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:07,583
You know

1486
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:10,655
How many people saw this in

1487
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,703
How many people were influenced

1488
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:13,471
Buy The Sims

1489
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:17,311
Information and you know you think all 1.5 billion is

1490
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:19,871
Is a lot but if you just had all of those people

1491
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,663
Who were taken in

1492
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:22,943
Give a dollar

1493
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:27,807
We be at 3 billion people of the dollars or whatever do you know what it's like

1494
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:31,391
Relatively speaking that harm he's caused

1495
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,159
So huge

1496
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:35,999
That's because we're so unused to money being that big

1497
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:38,303
It's hard to breath

1498
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:42,399
It is but yeah it's also the same difficulty with rapping

1499
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:43,935
But your head around the amount of damage

1500
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:45,727
So I think

1501
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,775
Italy orders you know there's

1502
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:48,543
There's

1503
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:51,359
But we'll see what happens

1504
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:52,383
Appeal form

1505
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:53,663
This case on its side

1506
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:55,711
Supplies

1507
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:56,735
Juicy Noir

1508
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:59,295
I don't expect him to

1509
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:00,575
And they smoke

1510
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:06,463
I say that now doing anything for the rest of his life

1511
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,023
I don't really

1512
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,815
Expected to win a raffle

1513
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:14,143
For the rest of us it was bizarre cuz I GHIN it's

1514
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:22,591
I did I mean it was kind of like a twisted puzzle I felt like an FBI agent doing string on the board trying to be like

1515
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:25,663
Is he or is this

1516
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:30,271
There's got to be a reason just making myself mad as I'm watching all these hearings

1517
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:32,319
You know it

1518
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:37,695
We'll see where that goes there and I don't know if Norms going to be handling the appeal

1519
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:39,231
Or what but

1520
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:40,511
I mean

1521
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:41,279
Suspect he will

1522
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:42,047
But

1523
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:48,447
All that's left for Baraboo maintained that the the luckiest man alive

1524
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:51,007
Is right now

1525
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:52,799
Just because normix

1526
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:53,823
It's like

1527
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:56,383
For all the things that Norm is done

1528
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:59,199
Whenever I found out

1529
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:00,991
The next morning after mark

1530
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:03,039
Had dramatically revealed that

1531
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:04,319
Right

1532
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:07,391
The next morning before they

1533
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:08,671
They the jury of gaunt

1534
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:09,439
The deliberation

1535
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:11,999
I remember right now just going

1536
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:14,047
To talk to the judge

1537
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:14,815
I'm just being like

1538
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:16,607
We would like

1539
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,911
To have that not have happened

1540
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:24,799
Can we get an extension on the 10 days or something is agencies just said I want to do over

1541
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:27,103
And it's like that's that's

1542
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:27,871
Unreal

1543
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,175
But then you know now Norm is like

1544
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:32,223
How about you just make us pay five bucks

1545
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:39,903
Yeah like I got the mobile at right now and it's like to be an a******

1546
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:44,511
And how are you negotiating with us

1547
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:48,095
I really do think that the only way

1548
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:50,655
You could win on or you know

1549
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:52,447
There's no way you can get out with

1550
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:53,983
And write as much as

1551
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:56,543
What are the moments from Connecticut trial that cracked

1552
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:57,567
Me up was

1553
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:00,639
I can't remember exactly what

1554
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:01,407
What it was

1555
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:02,431
The moment but

1556
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:04,735
Judge Bellas in Hayward having a discussion

1557
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:05,759
Ejections

1558
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:06,783
Inside German

1559
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:10,111
Ghetto judge Bella said well I'm assuming there will be in a

1560
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:12,415
Appeal to which Norm said what if we win

1561
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:19,327
Twisted Bell is repeating herself as said I'm assuming there's going to be an appeal you know this is outside the

1562
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:24,959
Presence of a jury and everything so it just cracked me off I hope she was a slave

1563
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:25,983
Buddy

1564
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:28,543
Yasso

1565
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:34,943
That is fantastic and I've certainly had my fine there but you know when

1566
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:41,343
Alex's lawyer say things like he'll he'll need a second job if he doesn't make millions of dollars you know who am I

1567
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:43,647
So

1568
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:45,695
Yeah that that's been fun too

1569
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:48,767
I've enjoyed those moments in another moment that

1570
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:50,559
Had me absolutely cracking

1571
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:52,095
The last Texas hearing

1572
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:53,375
Was

1573
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:55,423
When all was there and

1574
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:56,447
Judge

1575
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:57,215
Maya

1576
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:59,519
Wanted him to get his poster board

1577
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:01,311
You do but he had his own props

1578
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:05,919
I think you'll remember we couldn't we wanted that so bad we wanted that

1579
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:06,943
So bad

1580
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:08,991
And I still I'm dreaming of getting that

1581
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:13,343
Well judge Maya said basically can you please take these out of here

1582
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:16,159
We have them like in the back essentially

1583
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:19,487
And you know these yours and Mark

1584
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:21,279
Said that he would

1585
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:23,583
I think he said he would give her an all 100 bucks for

1586
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,655
And I

1587
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:28,447
Died laughing

1588
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:34,591
I just I'm so glad I was not hit in the courtroom in person that day because I would have

1589
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:36,895
Oh my God I would have had to have one of Alex

1590
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:37,663
Coughing fit

1591
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:39,711
The cover-up mobile

1592
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:42,527
Fantastic

1593
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:47,391
I think that is a great story to end on

1594
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:50,207
