1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge by knowledge

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Dot-com

5
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:06,048
Celine and talk a little bit about

6
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,192
Alex Joe indeed we are.

7
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,264
My bright spot today Jordan

8
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,568
Well I guess

9
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,104
I have

10
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,896
You know I for the last

11
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:24,992
Year or so I have wanted a PlayStation 5

12
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:28,320
First of all.

13
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:36,000
You couldn't spend the money because no one that had any of them if they were impossible to find

14
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:39,840
Before the Christmas this year

15
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,144
For the holiday I was able to

16
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,680
And I decided to get myself

17
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,728
A little bit of a Christmas present

18
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,056
And tell you I got the PS5

19
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,360
And I've been messing around with a couple

20
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,128
Boy games

21
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:56,736
Having a decent time enjoying some Arkham Knights

22
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:03,136
I I saw a Tara because I didn't you you told me that you got it

23
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:06,464
I had no idea what it actually was

24
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:10,560
The PlayStation 5

25
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:14,144
No I saw I saw a thing on TV about it

26
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:20,800
About Arkham Knight because I don't have TV or anyting sure it was it was over with my family for Christmas they had commercials and

27
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,640
It's Batman game

28
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:28,224
Spoiler alert for the first minute

29
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,808
It's a I mean

30
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,088
Look I don't know I guess

31
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,904
I've heard that I don't know this to be dreams I don't pay

32
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,768
A whole lot of attention but I understand there's some backlash about there not being Batman in it

33
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,424
Probably based and sexism a club level pass Batgirl is one of the playable characters share

34
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,728
Enjoyed it so far

35
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,008
It plays exactly

36
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:54,336
Essentially exactly like any of those old

37
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,128
Batman Arkham game

38
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:01,248
It's all you really want I mean honestly deep down it's just a bunch of ones

39
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:05,088
Zero's there are no men or women inside the video game atom

40
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:10,464
And then I started playing it as like mad I missed the Riddler trophies

41
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,096
That was funny was wondering to get Riddler trophy as the game as I played like maybe an hour into it like

42
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,888
Riddler trophy

43
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:21,472
So glad they're on your Riddler trophies

44
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,616
They're all over the f****** city of like I'm never going to get all eight

45
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,920
800 Visa whatever the flat there buddy

46
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,456
Anyway it's fun

47
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:37,856
What's a bright spot

48
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,648
Ill for a week or so ago

49
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:46,048
Concerned about her only communicating

50
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,328
Marvel

51
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,120
Including

52
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:54,752
Four different morbius cover

53
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,800
Morbius was a great way to

54
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:03,200
Appreciate your concern and the nice messages that

55
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,992
Percent of get well soon and such

56
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:08,576
For whatever it's worth you were not overly

57
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,624
Worrisome

58
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:15,744
And I appreciate your offer to it to help out

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,768
Whatever but like

60
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:21,887
You know we got gopuff now that's all we got some NyQuil

61
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,167
That's amazing

62
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:29,567
Yeah that is one of the few things that it does make me feel like we're living in the future

63
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,847
There have been

64
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:37,247
Service like that it was so weird to have in my mind like

65
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,783
I need Aspirin

66
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,087
Or or whatever I need Tylenol or

67
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,647
Can't get down the

68
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,183
Street to the CVS right

69
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,975
Or whatever

70
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,791
Not a problem

71
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,839
Really really spoiled

72
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:57,471
It's it's it makes me feel somewhat older I suppose or something but just like

73
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:02,591
The absolute amazement are you telling me that aspirin can be delivered

74
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,871
Right

75
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,919
Seems like that's not

76
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,735
That complicated of a problem

77
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,087
We took a while song

78
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,879
Yeah I don't know what

79
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,927
Exactly we got

80
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,999
Some sort of a cold or something

81
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:24,863
I'm not sure I tested for covid and I was negative so that did work some

82
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,911
Seemed like that was the case but

83
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:30,495
Yeah I'm feeling much better

84
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,519
You know

85
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,543
Well I'm glad to hear it

86
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,847
Yeah it's tough to take time off

87
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:38,431
Because it's fun I enjoy doing the show the best

88
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:42,271
Talking about this dumbass hole

89
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,063
Also

90
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,879
Compulsion to work

91
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:51,231
Ug who really do and I may have been working on some sites

92
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,071
You may have been working out those I think

93
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,351
Before we started talking

94
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:02,495
Sent out but I was not doing that while I was sick

95
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,287
Abundance of caution

96
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:07,103
Bother other side

97
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:11,199
Side stuff did you breathe and any bubble wrap and send it to China to teach

98
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,991
Teach them a lesson about amen

99
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,807
Good morning in China

100
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,391
Alright

101
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:23,487
So Jordan

102
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,023
On our horse

103
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:29,375
Then we're going to ride in on in Alexandria

104
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,703
So I decided

105
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,751
A little something and that was

106
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,543
Is that I don't want to do it

107
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:42,175
Play episode talking about another 2000 3 episode 9th and 10th

108
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,223

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,087
Hey holiday content is a little bit all over the place for Alec

110
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,391
True event here was what I

00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,767
Yourself he had a video about panda video

114
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:01,119
And the title of it was how one man changed the world and you can too

115
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,911
I like how it's going to be about Jesus

116
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
Yeah

117
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,727
Of course it's Christmas time

118
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,775
Is it going to be about reset

119
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:11,359
It's about Alex of course it's about Alex

120
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:15,199
Yeah what band Change the World by UK to I was like this is not

121
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:19,295

00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,087

00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,903
Big religious Outfitters you say baby

People

125
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,999
A theologian

126
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,559
Spiritual leader

127
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,583
Many would say

128
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,655
And devout Christian I think Alex

129
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,423
Nose

130
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:38,239
Christmas day more than any other day

131
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,519
It should be about out

132
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:46,175
Yeah I will say I didn't actually watch that video so maybe it is all about Jesus but the thumbnail of it is

133
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:52,319
And recover pictures of Alex from probably

134
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,391
Jesus that what that was like alright

135
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,671
My buddy

136
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,439
Have fun

137
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,231
Unless you're throwing a hatchet get the f***

138
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,791
Got to hear

139
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,327
About the year that has

140
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:07,423
Yeah for us it's been really

141
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,215
Interesting

142
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,239
Certainly there been

143
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,519
Developments Lotto

144
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,823
Things about Alex's court cases

145
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,431
Have touched us a little more closely than would be expected true

146
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:22,015
But I don't want to dwell on that I want to think about all of the

147
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:25,087
The dangling threads we have

148
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,159
This is just what I came up off the top of my

149
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
Okay

150
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,743
That's what else have we got

151
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,815
Monkeypox

152
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,607
Still going

153
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,887
The bride has been dropped

154
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,655
Entirely Alex

155
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,935
Not reported on beef

156
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,519
I almost zero case it's now in the United States

157
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,079
Nancy Pelosi's husband's attack being fake

158
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,127
Didn't

159
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:51,711
I don't know what's happening with that Alex you to drop that storyline chair

160
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:58,111
A nuclear war was supposed to have broken out by now only going to last a couple days

161
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,927
Shorts we have both nuclear war starting

162
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:04,511
And Selinsky was on Putin's payroll and all that

163
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,535
Does not

164
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:11,679
We have no update on that all the food plants

165
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,703
We're under attack

166
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:18,847
The food was all under attack

167
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:25,247
All of these things were supposed to make us scared this year

168
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,039
I think it I think it did work out but

169
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:31,135
Just wasting everybody's time

170
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,159
With nonsense

171
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,695
Strangled them scared about stop

172
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:40,095
It does feel like there should be a year and wrap up like like a whatever like a ATV Club or like top 50

173
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:43,167
See things of this year and if you really go through in like list

174
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,215
The amount of things that Alex

175
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,775
Wanted or should have happy

176
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,335
You're like that would be a busy year

177
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,639
Will be a busy f****** year

178
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:58,527
I mean it would be a disaster movie it would be a horror film

179
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,807
If

180
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,575
Westlake

181
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,903
You know like let's let's look at it as like a reverse Liar Liar

182
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:10,559
Where is Jim Carrey not being able to lie it's everything Alex says is spoken in

183
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:16,191
Twilight Zone Agatha Christie novel

184
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,239
The classic Knives Out mystery

185
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,311
Apparently also people are mad about

186
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:27,711
Are they bad about that I've done with backlashes I don't give a s*** I have not seen

187
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,479
This film

188
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,015
Straight but I've heard

189
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,391
Anyway instead of dwelling on

190
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,695
These dangling threads in like how Alex

191
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:44,095
Probably not going to spend the end-of-the-year cleaning up his mess I got this one wrong

192
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:50,239
Every year you should have if you

193
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,775
You should have a rose

194
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:55,871
Every year at the end of the year at the big ol holiday party

195
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:02,015
You sit up at the dais and everybody just kind of makes fun of all the s*** you made up

196
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
Sherp

197
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,879
I will come as a diesel tank

198
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:13,023
Cuz I'm picturing this as a roast like a Friars Club Roast right but each person on the dais

199
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,607
Is one of the things Alex lied about and they almost there

200
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
Alright

201
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:23,775
Feather the concept of the thing afro 608 somebody dressed as a nuclear bomb would walk up Abuela

202
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,847
I bet you thought I was going to drop

203
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,943
Here's the new bomb dropping on you I didn't I got something along those lines

204
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,759
You could be like a food plant on fire

205
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,831
Anyway we're going to be in past

206
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,879

207
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,231

Risen above

00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,911
F*** you and your new world order

251
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,959
And f*** the horse you rode in on

252
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,239
And all your s***

253
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,775
Maybe today

254
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,103
Maybe I'll just be gone a month maybe 5 years

255
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,919
Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow

256
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,455
And you never see me again

257
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,759
That's really what I want to do

258
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,063
I never want to come back here again

259
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,599
I apologize to

260
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,647
Yesterday that I

261
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,719
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

262
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,511
I'll be better tomorrow

263
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,815
He's not even better the past

264
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,423
I like that I like that

265
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:36,799
It probably my birthday by the I think

266
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,615
It was probably by anniversary I was at

267
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:46,015
Just put it in there cuz they will celebrate it and we'll celebrate with you for sure

268
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,575
Celebration of you and the life

269
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,111
And what have you told him

270
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:54,975
I need a absolutely that's the way to do it

271
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:56,767
It's your birthday

272
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,047
Go shorty

273
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:05,215
I understand that is that you're 50

274
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,615
That was karaoke for the day

275
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,407
It sounded like you were saying Beelzebub

276
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,175
Bezel

277
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,455
So

278
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,247
The nights

279
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,783
And

280
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:24,415
When I play this clip you may come around to the idea that my witchcraft already knows no bounds

281
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,303
Information

282
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,071
Today

283
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:31,839
We're going

284
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,375
Discover and I'm going to cover

285
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,495
Orange

286
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,031
The New York Times

287
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,615
Martial law

288
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:54,879
So Alex is gearing up to make people afraid and then

289
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:58,719
Teens how bad her going to be coming to to the US

290
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,023
Think about

291
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,791
Covid

292
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:05,887
The thing about covid relief gets into my head now is

293
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,423
When you look back at all these

294
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,703
All the previous

295
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,751
Possible pandemic

296
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:16,127
You know about global pandemics could become a global pandemic

297
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:20,991
And it seems like they did a good job do we have to like reevaluate

298
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,551
But I feel like we should go back

299
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,111
And re-evaluate the quality of

300
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:29,695
Previous pandemic responses and be like holyshit

301
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:32,511
These guys were unbelievably great

302
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:36,095
What happened with covid it's clearly these guys were the f******

303
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,375
Warriors

304
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:42,239
I think yes definitely there should be a certain amount of that

305
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:47,103
I think you know it can be difficult because they are different

306
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:50,943
Agents shorter different viruses

307
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,759
It's hard to compare 121 and also some

308
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,575
Some of it unfortunately also does come down to lock

309
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:00,159
Some things that are slightly outside of your

310
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,719
Control or require like complex

311
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,791
Cooperation that sometimes you can't rely on other people to

312
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:09,631
True but but yeah I do think they're probably lessons of the past

313
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,655
Destined

314
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,679
You know other

315
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:14,495
Coronavirus outbreak stats

316
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:21,407
What happened then and didn't happen now or vice versa

317
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,343
Well I don't want to stick difference and that is that

318
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,159
Wasn't a millionaire

319
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:35,999
If it 2002-2003 SARS outbreak

320
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,815
That's our new conspiracy theory if there is

321
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:43,423
A potential disaster happening somebody needs to steal all of Alex's yachty

322
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:49,823
And make sure he's nowhere near it and then whenever the disaster is averted Alex could pop back up on there or something like that you know

323
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:56,223
Yes yes we will need to keep him poor as a preventive measure against future outbreaks

324
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,015
From his money

325
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:02,367
And also this is December 2003 this is a bit after

326
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,671
Sorry said already

327
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,231
Yeah it was contained in July

328
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,535
1003 that was when there was like alright

329
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:16,191
Where we got this we got a good handle on this thing is like sporadic cases in 2004 but like it

330
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:19,263
It's not December 2003

331
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,055
The speculation of

332
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,079
This being

333
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,895
It's going to cause quarantine seriously in the United

334
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,175
It stayed at

335
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,455
It's a Longshot

336
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,551
Oh boy

337
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,367
You must think I'm his mind and that is that he's about to go to Houston

338
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,391
Okay

339
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,183
What to do in Houston

340
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,207
There is place

341
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,743
They show movie

342
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,535
Okay Alamo Drafthouse

343
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,095
He's mad cuz they've got

344
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:44,863
Views

345
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:45,887
Don't they

346
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:52,287
No that's pretty cool. The Austin one is apparently cool because he won't stop talk about help

347
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:56,895
Mel Gibson was just there showing The Passion of the Christ

348
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,175
Right and

349
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,967
Apparently he's going to the Houston won

350
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:03,807
The guy who runs the Houston one comes on the show trying to sell tickets

351
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,575
Which is like

352
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:08,159
What kind of a I'm sorry what movie

353
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:11,487
Very busy

354
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:15,327
I realize I haven't smelled this out at right is doing an event

355
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,887
Right in this at the Houston

356
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,655
Draft

357
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:23,519
Where are you showing one of his films during the day and then they're showing they live

358
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,567
Okay so it's sort of a big event

359
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,591
Right but

360
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,687
None of the theaters at the Alamo Drafthouse ours is that big

361
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:37,343
And if they're needing to move tickets by having the manager come on Alex's show as I can

362
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,671
Do a little PS I don't know what's going on here this is

363
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,951
This is like

364
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:46,047
The bad version of do it morning radio to try and Celtic

365
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,607

Tickets for Net10 ticket Soul just to do a show man bright implies one of two things one

371
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,807
Is like a really bad club or no draw

372
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:08,831
Yeah and

W many hours is backdrop

377
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:22,143
Announced they were doing tonight of they live I bet they would have done pretty well for them

378
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:26,239
Yeah maybe Alex is a negative factor in this

379
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,775
So anyway

380
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,335
He talks a little bit here about his last time

381
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,103
Doing one of these

382
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:31,871
Rescreening

Country

385
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:06,943
Probably

386
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,807
40 minutes

387
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,367
To get your tickets online

Folding chairs

00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,920
I don't know they'll be there this time

393
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,808
Great place

394
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:54,560
It's a great place to meet like-minded people like Mel Gibson's Holocaust

395
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:58,912
Mel Gibson's dad was there so what meet Holocaust deniers

396
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,960
You know where to go what a git

397
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,008
What is celebrity appearance

398
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,592
The dead of Mel Gibson

399
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:12,224
Yeah dude we got Richard Spencer's Dad here today selling f******

400
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,624
Cars outside of the BMW so you know Nazis it next time I see bad they're doing all right for themselves

401
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,648
I should say

402
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,440
The interest of fairness

403
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:27,840
I don't know what Richard Spencer's dad's beliefs are I do know what hot you did something really sorry

404
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,608
About that

405
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,656
Also I don't know if I am in luck

406
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,472
I Do by Alex's story about

407
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,312
You letting people in free and out of this stuff

408
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,104
Sound like the Alex I know

409
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,128
But

410
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,152
This sound

411
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,200
Really

412
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,992
Low-stakes

413
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:45,760
Yeah

414
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,576
For the Alex that we know in the present day

415
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:51,392
Like somebody who's giving like

416
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:55,488
A family member directions of how to get in free to the show

417
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,048
Actor of half an hour early you can't

418
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:01,120
Show open doors

419
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,680
Alright babe oh yeah this is

420
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:08,032
This is an almost weird 222

421
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:15,200
Obviously people come from somewhere they don't just start where they are but

422
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,224
For this type of

423
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,248
Singto then

424
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:22,880
Steamroll into what it became you know your I would understand it just type

425
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:23,904
Peppa Pig

426
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,952
Later on he became a slave

427
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,744
More successful version of himself

428
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,144
Hope you know

429
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,936
Go back this would make sense

430
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,984
But we live in now where it's like

431
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,264
He's turned into

432
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,800
F****** Super shredder

433
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:45,920
After drinking too much booze and now it's it's all collapsing around

434
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:56,928
Episode not too long ago he flew to Kansas City to do a local radio

435
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,072
At this point in the past he is just like

436
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,912
I want to I want to say one thing

437
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:10,496
I think some people have a little bit less excitement about

438
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,032
The past episode does opposed

439
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,312
The present because

440
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,104
Present has a lot of like

441
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,384
Hot Topic

442
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,992
Some things that are in the news and no kidding Alex's take on it can sometimes

443
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:26,880
You know help understand where a lot of right-wing talking points are I understand that and I don't want to

444
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,184
Ignore that

445
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:29,952
Completely

446
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:34,304
But going back to the past has some other side advantages

447
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,840
And this day live

448
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,632
Show is kind of touching

449
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,168
She's close to one of them in that is

450
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:43,264
I want to find more movie reviews

451
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:46,592
I want to find more episodes where Alex

452
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,896
Explain exactly what he thinks

453
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,176
Art is saying

454
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,968
Timmy

455
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,736
Are you

456
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:58,368
Recently remembered that we did that episode talking about his view of the second Matrix movie

457
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,392
And Blake

458
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,976
Oh yeah to me is I need more of that

459
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,512
I need more of like

460
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,280
Alex

461
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:10,144
Saying I believe that this is the message of Avatar or whatever

462
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,216
Yeah him trying to interpret art outside of

463
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:13,984
Whenever he

464
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,336
Leaving politics in the n in really does try to get into art criticism

465
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,128
Art for its own sake

466
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,944
Yeah is one of the windows into a truly bizarre my

467
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,784
That is that is what I want to find

468
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,088
Is the gold of digging for these Hills

469
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,136
So anyway we get back to store

470
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:34,464
Sound a little familiar

471
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,120
U.s. quarantine

472
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,384
Programs

473
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,152
For sure

474
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,224
According to

475
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,272
Thermometer

476
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,464
99 + 4

477
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,512
Police firefighters

478
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,536
Medical workers

479
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,240
Has been altered

480
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,408
The fear Monger was that weapon

481
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,944
Remind

482
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:32,832
The Commerce

483
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:40,256
Martial law

484
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,864
In Colorado Springs

485
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,632
The farmers

486
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,216
When's the Commerce

487
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:57,152
Dynamic to the game that right-wing propaganda s******* like Alex have to engage in the

488
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,688
Call out a little bit here

489
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,480
In order to run their game of

490
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:04,320
Constantly making the audience afraid about novel and exciting threat

491
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:07,136
They're required to rewrite their own past ideas

492
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:13,280
Alex the compellingly freakout his listeners about covid being a lab-made bioweapon in 2020

493
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:19,168
It's pretty important for him to not give off the impression that he's just the kind of guy that says that all the time

494
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,520
You would lose a lot of his ability to convince them that he's proven that the

495
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:27,872
The sky is falling if they were made aware

496
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,664
But he's really is making s*** up

497
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:36,320
2020 the 2003 SARS outbreak is real in service of helping Alex make the argument that the

498
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,088
The current one is

499
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:37,856
Is not

500
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:44,512
Hey things have gotten out of control in 2003 the way they did it in our present antiva

501
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,816
Game as he has recently

502
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:49,632
But it wouldn't have been nearly as impactful giving his

503
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,168
Bar smaller influencer

504
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:54,752
And the Dynamics around social media not being there at the time

505
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:01,664
The model State emergency Powers Act was a piece of draft legislation that was crafted by a Georgetown law professor with

506
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,200
Support from the CDC

507
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:09,088
It was not ever adopted or pass on a federal level though some state governments of past elements of it

508
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:15,232
For instance in March 2003 Arizona passed a bill requiring the department of health services to redact

509
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,536
Personally and identifying info

510
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,560
From health record

511
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,840
Before they release publicly

512
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:25,472
The couple of these State bills do provide a clarification of what law enforcement entities

513
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:28,800
Can do to assist with Department of Health orders involving cortines

514
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:32,384
But it's a far cry from anything like martial law with Alex's say

515
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:35,712
Plus this is the state government to states rights or something

516
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,600
Also Alex fails to mention that his mortal enemy the ACLU is an entity leading

517
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:45,184
The opposition to the model State emergency Powers Act

518
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,208
Do the concerned

519
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,232
How about vague language

520
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,512
Which they could lead to civil

521
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,536
Infringement

522
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,072
House just ignores that

523
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,120
Because it would make it harder for him to paint them is

524
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,400
The evil demon globulin

525
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:57,472
This to his audience of acknowledge what they actually do

526
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,776
How does further mixing up his history

527
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:06,688
Saddam used chemical weapons on civilians in 1984 but the shipments of West Nile were made in 1985

528
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,016
They weren't specifically to Sadam Ali worth

529
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,808
Made by Rumsfeld but it did happen

530
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:18,720
There wasn't a recce scientist who previously been a researcher in Fort Collins Colorado who received shipments of West Nile

531
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,000
Presumably Ford lab

532
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:20,768
Research purposes

533
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,584
There's a huge conversation that deserves

534
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,376
We had and has been had but

535
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:30,240
Maybe could be had more about the unintended consequences of dual-use chemical agents

536
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:33,568
There were sold to a Rockin for research purposes

537
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,336
Before

538
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,360
Desert Storm

539
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:39,456
But that actual conversation is almost nothing to do with West Nile

540
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,480
And Alex

541
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,248
Is

542
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,272
All over the place

543
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,064
But today

544
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,880
The extent that you know our soldiers did

545
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,648
End up

546
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,184
Dino finding these

547
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,464
These old

548
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,048
I'm stopping and being effect

549
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,072
Did buy them

550
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,096
Is

551
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,632
On

552
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:00,704
Acceptable

553
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,984
Agree

554
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,752
But

555
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:08,896
It makes me want it like listening to that makes me wonder how old those conservative Bingo cards really are you know like that

556
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:09,920
Like are we going to

557
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:13,504
To find fossilized records of a dinosaur been like

558
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,040
Are there busing in

559
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:18,624
Protester dinosaurs you know like is it's the same s***

560
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,904
From the gym

561
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,976
Well you know you always see

562
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,512
People

563
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:28,352
I am a little bit worried about this coming out of my mouth now because I have not looked

564
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:31,680
To Intuit you know you do see those like political cartoons

565
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,960
That are

566
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,240
Ostensibly from

567
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:39,872
70 years ago you like thematically fairly similar to

568
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,920
To now when there is

569
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,200
But there's things that it like

570
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,992
What kind of mirror totally

571
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,576
Some of the Bingo cards probably

572
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,600
Rudy

573
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,136
Yeah because you know it

574
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,416
Because

575
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,952
Is it and it it has to be

576
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,512
Because the bingo card has nothing to do with what's being

577
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,072
Instead the bingo card is bad thinking

578
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,864
It is how you are thinking

579
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,632
Poorly

580
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,936
In response to an infant

581
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:08,032
So it's it's like a it's like any old

582
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,056
Logical fallacy

583
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:12,640
The fallacy isn't changing its the thinking that's causing

584
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,968
This is largely similar things

585
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,736
Like

586
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,016
Being

587
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:21,600
Surrounded by people who you perceive to not be like

588
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,368
AcuRite

589
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:25,184
New technology that you find Freddy

590
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,232
Those are kind of

591
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,000
Pretty

592
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:28,768
Common

593
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:34,912
Or Public Health crisis is another hot hot water changes for

594
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,192
Bad thinking

595
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,008
It's not going to be that sucker

596
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,288
Change

597
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,056
From time.

598
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:45,664
I mean just this

599
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,392
Emergency

600
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,024
1 out of 100

601
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,168
You're not scared

602
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,664
Super

603
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,712
40 million people

604
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,248
About that

605
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:26,112
You're the one

606
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,464
That is not fear-mongering

607
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,632
Jerk talking point of comparing a public health concern to the flu

608
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,656
In order to minimize

609
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:43,008
There were relatively few deaths from the 2002 outbreak of SARS

610
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:47,360
But a lot of it probably comes down to there being a robust response to it and ask

611
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,128
Getting lucky

612
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,712
Alex's just a little bit off on that flew Story 2

613
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,272
In 1998 researchers found

614
00:32:54,528 --> 00:33:00,160
Fragments of the 1918 flu in 6 under the bodies from the Norwegian

615
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:04,768
That flew is one that really scares scientist

616
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:08,864
Because it wasn't really clear why it was so deadly and how it moves

617
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,632
So fast

618
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,680
Research on that end of things is

619
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:14,752
Top because there aren't exactly a ton of preserved samples of the

620
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,520
The flu the people

621
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,288
Printers work with

622
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,848
That's the goal was to find somebody

623
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,640
Who might have contained the virus

624
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:21,664
Got really deep

625
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,432
Frozen

626
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,712
Which led people to

627
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,736
To the Arctic

628
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:31,136
They tried the time machine but everybody was trying to kill Hitler with it and then it collapsed in on itself after creating paradoxes terrible ideas

629
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,160
24 bodies

630
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,440
Let's go to the cold

631
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,232
So from a New York Times article

632
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:41,632
Quote in a diary kept by the coal mining company here doctor Duncan found the names of seven men

633
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,424
18 to 29 years old

634
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,264
Farmers and fishermen who had just arrived here to earn extra money

635
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,544
Hey winter jobs in

636
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,312
The mine

637
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,360
But they have contracted

638
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:55,200
Flew on the boat trip from the mainland and died in the first week

639
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,736
Of October 1980

640
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,880
He's a fascinating story but ultimately they did not find samples that could be used for research since the body

641
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,696
Please turn to have not actually been buried in permafrost

642
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,232
As they had expect

643
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:13,632
Right and I'll just following this story he probably should have known about this by 2003 but in reality

644
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,912
The details of the story

645
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:22,848
The only part of the story that has any value is the insinuations he can make out of Sensational in it and inaccurate

646
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:23,872
Versions of headline

647
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:27,712
That's why it's still lives on in this form just

648
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,760
Yeah yeah that's

649
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:34,112
That's a bit different from the store the story they found

650
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:39,744
Living samples of the flu that killed 40 to 50 million people in their turning into a weapon

651
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,584
The story of they went looking and didn't find anything

652
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,608
Less scary

653
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:51,008
Less like at the beginning of a Godzilla movie when Godzilla comes out of the water and then blowing stuff up your like

654
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:51,776
Oh that's scary

655
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,056
But if it was just

656
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:53,824
Water

657
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,640
You mean like this is not a movie at all but there's like a gecko

658
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:59,200
Exactly like that it's not a movie

659
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,224
Vista Vista

660
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,504
Yeah

661
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,576
I think if I understand correctly from what I was looking at

662
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,600
Itzy

663
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:10,976
The issue was they thought that the people were buried deeper than they were

664
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:13,280
And so it would have preserved

665
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,400
M d price and it was not you

666
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:21,984
Even close I'm so the ground would have thought in Frozen

667
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,032
And thawed and Frozen therefore there's no

668
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:30,688
Usable samples that's a true like National Treasure ass moment you know that's Nicolas Cage

669
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:37,088
It's being like I figured it out we've come up with this long circular would circuitous route to get these samples

670
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,648
Because we can't find him any other way we've dug

671
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,952
F****** Norwegian Earth

672
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,232
There's no

673
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:47,328
I was reading

674
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:50,912
Maybe was a little unfair to the people who buried them

675
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:57,312
Speculations

676
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:02,944
They didn't want to dig all the way down cuz it was cold out to Lazy bad for my fault

677
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:09,088
And padrino you still markdown it was happy or whatever put the other the other one was a little bit less

678
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,368
I'm sort of suspicious

679
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,392
So that was like

680
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,720
They might have been scared of being exposed to a

681
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:21,120
I wouldn't want to touch Play Cloudy likes a little bit more sensitive

682
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:28,288
Quit jumping gravediggers won't help us save people from

683
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,568
Future

684
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:36,224
So Alex talked about this a little bit so it ends up mocking something that says in hindsight

685
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,016
Quite a good prediction

686
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,352
The one in Austin

687
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,008
It's a Marshalls

688
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,480
He'll require masks

689
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,952
For martial law

690
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,488
Brace yourselves for a

691
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,328
Or dr. iten was

692
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,120
Ghetto pretty

693
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:28,704
The commonly accepted in node within the medical and

694
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,008
Epidemiologic

695
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,056
The problem with those

696
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:33,824
Predictions

697
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,360
Is that they are true

698
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,896
Regardless of

699
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,688
When or if they come

700
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,480
Like when they come true is not

701
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,760
The important factor

702
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,040
It's not like all

703
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:45,600
He predicted something amazing it snows like no

704
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,904
This is an inevitability about

705
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,208
Lightsaber icing with humans

706
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,512
There will be another pandemic

707
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,048
How it f****** works

708
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:57,632
You don't you can't mock people in real life

709
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:00,448
Not a prediction math

710
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,984
That's how it works man

711
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,288
It will rain

712
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,312
Eventually

713
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,848
What exactly

714
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,384
You can have an umbrella

715
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,408
Or

716
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,688
Do you run the risk of getting

717
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,712
Wescom

718
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,992
And getting rain.

719
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,296
These are the inevitabilities

720
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:18,880
And we option that's the way it goes

721
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,512
You are still going to get wet

722
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,536
Sure

723
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:30,656
So I find it to be a little bit Rich that Alex and kind of beings

724
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,448
Smug about this when the guy was just

725
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,728
Totally right

726
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,264
Of course he was

727
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:38,336
Bombs

728
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,360
I'd Russia

729
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,176
We're not on Russia

730
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:45,504
Steambow in 2003

731
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,320
Russia

732
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:52,160
Bomber detonated explosives

733
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,952
Square

734
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,008
Victims

735
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,432
Peace at Russia

736
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:16,992
A broken window

737
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,272
The

738
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,320
Alarm could be heard

739
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:29,536
There are real terrorists but

740
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,840
Putin uses it as a police state Crackdown

741
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,632
So this one might be real

742
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:37,472
But yeah Alex says never never heard

743
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,496
Rush hour food

744
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,544
Doing this kind of thing

745
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,568
In the present

746
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,848
I mean

747
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:43,616
Steve

748
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,920
He called him and he said he does it

749
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:52,320
All the time like it's a regular like

750
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,344
Police state

751
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,928
Somebody's leg

752
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:03,072
So you pretend that there's a car bombers he has a habit of terrorizing

753
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:07,168
Our real terrorists

754
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,192
Somewhere

755
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,728
But not in Russia

756
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:10,752
Southall pool

757
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,032
Haha

758
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,056
Anyway that's curious

759
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:13,824
It's weird

760
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,872
So Alex a number calls

761
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,896
On this episode

762
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,480
This this

763
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:24,064
This color is I mean this this is bad news I don't know how else to

764
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:32,256
There's it there's something that we know and that is at Alex's films have a 92 95-98

765
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:34,560
Percent Effectiveness rate

766
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,328
Super effect

767
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:40,192
Yeah they're dangerous there more transmissible than most diseases yeah yeah

768
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:42,752
But unfortunately

769
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,776
The caller calls in

770
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:48,384
And says that like people aren't enjoying them that much

771
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,688
Alex's

772
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,712
Good luck

773
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,088
Jupiter police

774
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,160
Bro

775
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,072
Waking up roughly

776
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,008
Because lately I've been I've been hearing from a

777
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:18,080
All of them

778
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:22,688
Tri-County mental average

779
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:27,040
What are you talkin about mental Everett

780
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:32,672
Fingers that doesn't why would you edit it why would you edit it down

781
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:35,488
I got to be modest you got to stay humble

782
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:40,096
I don't understand

783
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,656
Okay so you're at

784
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:45,728
I think it's probably because there had been like

785
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,008
Some despondent

786
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,032
Ishq calls

787
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:53,151
Sure like there had been a couple people within the last week or so on his show who had said like

788
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,687
You know people aren't responding

789
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,967
2 XYZ

790
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,527
Is it maybe just in the sake of like

791
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:01,855
Let's at least match the energy that the colors are bringing

792
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:05,183
It's not over sell this thing it's going to look glaring

793
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:07,999
We're down 280

794
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:13,631
This is kind of like a negotiation strategy know you start so delusional right

795
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:18,239
Somehow the reasonable is even more delusional

796
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,055
The crazy hot

797
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,847
Absurd

798
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,127
I mean if you count plate

799
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:28,223
Then maybe a

800
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,527
People are nice

801
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,063
20%

802
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,343
Best

803
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,111
Best

804
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,647
I mean

805
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:39,231
Look how many family members does Mel Gibson have

806
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:42,815
That does give the number

807
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:47,935
So Alex is down on these tapes man 80%

808
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,751
That's a big head you say 80% to 90%

809
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,031
What you mean 270

810
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,383
Everyone's a little bit sad

811
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:02,783
That prompts I think a little bit of a conversation about how important ingrate Alice's tapes are

812
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,879
Thank you for

813
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:07,903

856
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:27,679
Creepiest Chris

00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:32,799
Message from Louisiana Dentures I've ever to buy at what the fuk was that

My VCR is giving me trouble

861
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:52,255
That was the saddest thing I think I've ever heard in my entire life my VCR is giving me troubles but the

862
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,791
The tapes are the only way we can

863
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,071
Can fight meme

864
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:55,839
God

865
00:45:56,095 --> 00:46:01,471
Your leak genuinely afraid that your wife is going to be taken to a

866
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:04,031
FEMA camp and raped by a foreign Soldier

867
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,567
That's what you think

868
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,103
And the solution

869
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:12,991
Is spread Alex's Palmyra in marketing for Alex

870
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:15,295
Happened in that man's brain

871
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:17,343
Alex

872
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,135
Outfit

873
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:25,535
Alex scaring people about a hundred different things that I can't keep track of anything and then

874
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,815
Selling them the solution

875
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,863
Bissell

876
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,143
The impotence

877
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,935
Of Alex's

878
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,215
Just sort of model

879
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:39,359
Good example of that where it's like the only thing we can do is

880
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:41,151
Promote Alex's

881
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,175
Contact

882
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,455
This is the

883
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:46,783
The end-all-be-all of the fight against the globalist

884
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,575
Is just being Alex's Street to you

885
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,111
Yeah yeah

886
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,903
I mean the thing is

887
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:52,927
And I listen

888
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,719
This is a weird little

889
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:55,743
Side thing

890
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,023
What's what's

891
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,559
Strange to me about that

892
00:46:59,071 --> 00:46:59,839
Is that Alex

893
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,631
Talks almost non-stop about like

894
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:06,239
Suicide bombers and Ed all of these things you know like

895
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,543
People who are in an actual fight

896
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:15,967
Driven to a point of desperation so serious that the only way they feel like they have to fight back the only thing they have to fight back

897
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:16,735
Back with his I live

898
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:20,063
And he's telling these people they're in that type of fight

899
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,879
And the way they have to fight with everything that God is by

900
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,159
Making video

901
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:28,767
Sprite and giving them to people and fixing your VCR

902
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:29,535
Yeah

903
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,815
How does that not

904
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:33,119
Breakthrough your cognitive dissonance

905
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,679
I'm not sure

906
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:42,335
Really really bums me out I'm not some

907
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:46,175
People who takes like holidays too seriously

908
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,455
I think you and I are both

909
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,223
Kind of like

910
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:48,991
Christmas

911
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:51,807
Real raised Christian of course

912
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:57,439
Have kind of a weariness of Chris Christmas

913
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:04,863
There is something about this guy being like this Christmas please make a copy of Alex's tape

914
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:10,495
It's like the worst Miracle on 34th Street speech

915
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:16,895
Please just believe he's from a bad Christmas movie

916
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:22,271
Sounds so genuine it sounds so Earnest it sounds like this man

917
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,551
What's to leave the world

918
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:26,367
Boys knowing that he doesn't have much time left

919
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,647
Xbox

920
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,415
But but

921
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:31,231

You telling me more things about how poorly my business is run

995
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,655
I know it

996
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:57,567
I think that maybe there is even a vulnerability that Alex has at this point in his career of like

997
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,639
Appearing that he has other people who do things

998
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,663
Like shipping

999
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:02,687
Departments in

1000
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:04,223
Stuff like that

1001
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,503
I did the

1002
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:07,039
Got to be the one man

1003
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:10,111
Business ideas should be

1004
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:15,487
Looks like him putting he stamps on the envelope that I have

1005
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,791
Yeah that that's kind of the image

1006
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,583
Think maybe

1007
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:22,143
Hanging up on the guy what kind of bus

1008
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:25,471
About a little bit well I mean that's a good thing we don't do our calling

1009
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:28,031
Because then people call it'll be like

1010
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:31,871
I haven't gotten my button yet we're like yeah you haven't

Liberty from

1018
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,399

Have made it

1027
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,119
Very clear

1028
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:29,727
To anyone who wants that information and the French

1029
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:32,031
Sculpture is even

1030
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:33,567
Alright so this should be

1031
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,847
Widely known

1032
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:36,127
That

1033
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,407
It's not the United States

1034
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:40,735
Symbol of freedom and Hope

1035
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:44,575

1036

Daredevil

1037
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:52,255
It's either a crossdresser or it is the devil

1038
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:56,863
Yeah and it's got a illuminati crown and torch

1039
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,679
Prometheus I guess maybe

1040
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,471
Yeah none of this is

1041
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,239
Based on 8th

1042
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:05,311
There was speculation that

1043
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:07,359
It was based

1044
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:09,407
On the sculptors mother

1045
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:10,431
And then

1046
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,199
Two people heads

1047
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:15,807
Suggested that the sculptors brother also looks fairly similar

1048
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:22,207
Resemblance

1049
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:23,231
FreedomPop around

1050
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,255
And

1051
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:30,655
You know this isn't like something that I was just pulling out of thin air right there are people who Bandy these ID

1052
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:32,447
Videos about the like a model for a

1053
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,751
Could have been his brother or

1054
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:37,055
Something along those lines but

1055
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:40,383
It's saying it's in mainstream book

1056
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:43,455
And value know that sculpture Center

1057
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:50,879
Try to be more interesting than he actually is

1058
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:51,903
Based off of

1059
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,439
Then you're going to because I'll

1060
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:54,719
Secret

1061
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:55,999
Michelangelo's David

1062
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:57,279
Not ask

1063
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:59,583
What wasn't actually a

1064
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,119
Michelangelo didn't even know the

1065
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,399
Nevermind

1066
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,679
Andrina's

1067
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:04,959
Did have a head

1068
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,055
That's a common misconception

1069
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:09,823
Conception

1070
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,615
She didn't have an arm

1071
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,407
She did have a head

1072
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,943
And then the other arm fell off

1073
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:17,759
Wait somebody stole the head of the statue

1074
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:18,783
To have no head

1075
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,391
Where to get the no head for

1076
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,415
From

1077
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:26,463
Sculpture that has no head

1078
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:32,351
Plenty of sculptures that have no head

1079
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,119
And you can make

1080
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,655
Not have a head screw

1081
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,935
So the 9th

1082
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:37,727
You know

1083
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,263
Picture

1084
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:45,919
They're complaining about to Soros being a bioweapon so that's that's a good bit of fun there's an issue

1085
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:46,687
Stuff about these two

1086
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:52,319
Calls about Lakes customer service and said

1087
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:54,367
Christmas movie speech

1088
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:55,391
About these days

1089
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,159
The sads

1090
00:55:56,671 --> 00:56:01,535
Bizarre preoccupation and then also Alex's a little bit of

1091
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,327
Sponsor so that's

1092
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,095
That's the crew

1093
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:04,863
Christmas spirit

1094
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:05,631
That's fun

1095
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:09,215
And Alex has a big

1096
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:09,983
Story

1097
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,807
For the

1098
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:33,279
Describe is a Nazi

1099
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:52,735
Fox grabbing

1100
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:58,623
Terrified

1101
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:00,671
Story suck

1102
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:05,279
It's tragedy and I'm going to guess that Alex is going to miss the forest

1103
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,559
Patrice talking about it

1104
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,327
He always does

1105
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:08,863
On November 5th

1106
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,167
2003 the police in Goose

1107
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:17,311
Creek South Carolina conducted a raid on students at Stratford High School after the principal decided that one student

1108
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:19,103
Was possibly selling weed

1109
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:21,407
The student body of the schools

1110
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:23,455
25% African-American

1111
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:29,855
But over quote more than two-thirds of those caught up in the sweep where Africa

1112
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:34,719
Ultimately no drugs or weapons were found and no charges were ever filed

1113
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:36,511
Great a cynical view of things

1114
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:42,911
Might lead one to assume that the only reason that this became a story at all is because there was surveillance video of the rated

1115
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:44,447
Self and this is

1116
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:46,751
Kind of bleach it to imagine

1117
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:47,775
That this is

1118
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:48,543
Good

1119
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,823
Conceivably

1120
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,639
Be happening in other schools and what that my

1121
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:53,407
Must be like

1122
00:57:54,431 --> 00:58:00,575
What are the reasons that the story proceeded the way that it did is because 20 of the students who were the subject of this

1123
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:05,951
Raber represented by the ACLU who had the resources to take this all the way to a settlement

1124
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:10,047
The school district handled searches and

1125
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:11,327
Established a fund

1126
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:12,863
For the students who are victimized

1127
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,399
Best cover medical expenses

1128
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,679
And therapy

1129
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:20,799
This lawyer that Alex has autism member of the legal team that is also representing some

1130
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:22,847
Students and that's great as well

1131
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:26,687
So much of this comes down to a conversation about

1132
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:28,991
And I think it's pretty clear that Alex

1133
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:29,759
Isn't going

1134
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:35,647
One of the reasons that this case is particularly suspicious was the timing of the rate

1135
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:36,415
Which took place at

1136
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:37,695
6:45 a.m.

1137
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:43,839
The reason Mississippi suspicious is because that was prior to the arrival time of most of the School's bus

1138
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:48,959
The only buses that it arrived were the ones that picked up student to live relatively close

1139
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:51,775
Which was a group that was predominantly black

1140
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,055
In Essen

1141
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:53,823
The school

1142
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:57,407
Intentionally or not create the situation where the primarily White

1143
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:58,943
8 students would arrive at school

1144
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:00,991
2 seed of mostly blacks dude

1145
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:03,551
Things being searched and made to kneel while please help them

1146
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:07,903
It's a dehumanizing scene and the race aspect of it is

1147
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:10,207
Pretty much impossible to ignore

1148
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:11,999
But we'll see how Alex

1149
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:14,559
I mean I just

1150
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:16,351
I am not

1151
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,679
Going to have to be a lot of effort

1152
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:21,983
Can I have to be a lot of effort to

1153
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:24,287
To pretend that this is not about race

1154
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:25,567
Yeah

1155
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:27,359
Well I mean I think

1156
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:29,663
I think you could probably make

1157
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:31,711
A couple of

1158
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:33,503
Interesting ways

1159
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:35,039
This around this one

1160
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:37,087
Is that it's not all

1161
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:37,855
About Rick's

1162
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:44,511
There's a large portion and maybe if you want to focus on some of those other things to the exclusion

1163
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:46,047
Turn of the larger conversation

1164
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:48,095
But if that's

1165
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,399
The way Alex Mike's

1166
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:52,959
Cc is economic C

1167
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:57,055
Because it's all about economics because of the

1168
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:58,591
Regional

1169
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,895
It's the areas

1170
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:03,455
And then you could just be like well it

1171
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,223
It's police state

1172
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:05,503
You know like

1173
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:07,039
Wow

1174
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:10,367
There is there is a truth to it that this is

1175
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:12,671
An appropriate policing of NTB

1176
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:14,463
You know having

1177
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,999
Dogs

1178
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:20,095
Doing a research

1179
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:22,655
Of a school over something

1180
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:23,679
You have no problem

1181
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:26,495
Cars are no real reason outside of a

1182
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:29,311
Yeah kind of level of evidence

1183
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:31,103
It's it's intrusive

1184
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:31,871
Very least

1185
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:33,919
Yeah all of the laws that we have

1186
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:34,943
To keep that from happening

1187
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:37,247
Yeah but it seems like the laws are being used

1188
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,015
To make that have

1189
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,039
Which is an issue

1190
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:44,159
Babies fair enough that there is like

1191
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:46,207
The police stady aspect

1192
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:47,743
But

1193
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:49,535
Against focus on that

1194
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:50,559
Without looking

1195
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:51,839
The broader picture of it

1196
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:52,607
I think is a

1197
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:55,935
It's not dealing with story as a b

1198
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:58,239
Seltzer

1199
01:00:58,751 --> 01:00:59,519
Alex

1200
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:03,103
Talks a little bit about a news story about this rate

1201
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,639
And this

1202
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,663
Is dumb

1203
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:11,039
On one of the time

1204
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,575
And that you cannot have a hole

1205
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,599
Call GroupMe

1206
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:17,439
Sweet

1207
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:21,279
Personnel

1208
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:25,887
Adduction

1209
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,287
You do not have the dog.

1210
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:43,039
Train

1211
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,367
Dogs

1212
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:47,647
So for one thing

1213
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:49,951
Czechoslovakia dissolved in 1993

1214
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:53,791
So if this dog was trained there that's a pretty old.

1215
01:01:54,047 --> 01:02:00,191
I have no idea why a small-town department in South Carolina with Outsource their drug dog training to Eastern Europe

1216
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:00,959
But that seems

1217
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:06,335
Kind of cost-prohibitive if you want the best you have to pay for it okay

1218
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:12,735
Please start training center in North Carolina as well as Slovakia

1219
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:13,759
Play the Czech Republic

1220
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:16,063
Once they split apart and their dog training

1221
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,343
Went to s***

1222
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:19,135
So I was really confused about this

1223
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:25,535
Aspirator article that Alex's reading from and it turns out that it says the dog is a Czechoslovakian

1224
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:28,351
Alex

1225
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:29,887
Taking the dogs breed

1226
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:36,287
I'm pretending that it begins with the dog was trained in Europe I guess because it makes the dog sound more scary

1227
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:42,687
I will say this I am slightly more terrified of an Eastern European German Shepherd

1228
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:49,343
Stereotypically terrifying place to train soap again.

1229
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:53,439
Also at no point in the article does it say that the dog whose name is Major

1230
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:56,255
They don't attack

1231
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,023
Dog

1232
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:57,791
This is

1233
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:01,119
Best Alex lying about a partner in the article that.

1234
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:03,167
Describe the difference between passive

1235
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04,447
Active alert

1236
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:05,215
Detection.

1237
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:09,823
Some dogs respond to finding drugs by sitting which is passive train

1238
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,103
Ansible Berkeley

1239
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:11,871
Which is the more grass

1240
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:12,639
Style

1241
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:17,503
I was either lying about this or just making up a detail to create an angle for the audience

1242
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:19,295
To hang on to that doesn't involve the key

1243
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:20,831
Clear racism that underlies

1244
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:21,599
The story

1245
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:24,159
Everything about the raid in the search sucks

1246
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:25,951
And I'm not minimizing any of that stuff

1247
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:29,023
I'm just saying that I was not a good source of information on any

1248
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:34,911
If you have the article he's reporting on in front of you and you watch along as Alex reads

1249
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:37,983
It often becomes really clear how is process work

1250
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:42,079
He's basically just skimming along and finding words to use as Anchor Point

1251
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:44,383
And in this case Czechoslovakia is a

1252
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:46,431
Pretty glaring an embarrassing one

1253
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:51,295
This behavior is constant and consistent throughout his career so generally if people listen

1254
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:52,063
Alex

1255
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:58,463
Brother best for them to double-check his work so you can tell how much of it is just he's making up to sound smarter and more interesting

1256
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,487
Weller putting

1257
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:02,559
Literally zero effort into doing any show prep

1258
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:03,583
Cuz why would you

1259
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:04,607
Yeah

1260
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:07,423
That's he knows that the s*** that he saying isn't

1261
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:10,495
Truth why put time into preparing

1262
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:16,127
It almost Works to your disadvantage because if you have a

1263
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:17,919
Well-prepared lie

1264
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:19,199
It's too good

1265
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:19,967
Tubi

1266
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:26,367
To be true xability

1267
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:29,951
Stick with it so you can't change it as much later on your like

1268
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:31,743
I put a lot of work into this bowl

1269
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:38,143
I'm not going to just go ahead and say that Putin is a good guy now

1270
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:39,423
Chebakia goddamnit

1271
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:40,959
Hello how am I

1272
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:42,751
Oh my God I can't believe that that's

1273
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:43,519
How do you

1274
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,591
So I got something a little bit backwards

1275
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:47,615
And that is on

1276
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:49,151
The 9th

1277
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:54,271
That first Show interview with Larry Pratt

1278
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:57,855
Gunownersofamerica is water filter

1279
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:59,135
Their sponsor comes in

1280
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:01,183
And here's a little taste of that

1281
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:20,895
It really is

1282
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:21,919
And

1283
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:23,199
Alex Weaver

1284
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:24,991
We got a couple of Christmas

1285
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:27,295
That we wanted to share with

1286
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,183
A thought crime

1287
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:42,399
Yeah man can say Christmas got a war on his

1288
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:43,423
Boy

1289
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:44,703
I have some

1290
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:45,727
Very

1291
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:47,775
Left

1292
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:54,943
What is that unseated destroy God type liberal

1293
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:57,759
A number of them said Merry Christmas

1294
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:03,135
Merry Christmas to you

1295
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:08,767
2003 they care less than 19 years later

1296
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,303
Even less the other

1297
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:11,071
That's a lot of fun

1298
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:17,215
One of the things that I think is interesting to Note 2 is that I'm noticing a

1299
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:17,983
Trend

1300
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,263
In this.

1301
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:21,567
Alex's career where a lot of the Abbott

1302
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:22,847
Add stuff is

1303
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:24,639
Brokered programming

1304
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:25,407
But

1305
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:27,455
Pretty clear what it is

1306
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:29,247
It's strange

1307
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:33,599
Because it doesn't feel like they're trying to hide that they are an infomercial

1308
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:37,183
They're still blending content and the pitch

1309
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:39,487
That is for sure in April 8th

1310
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:40,767
Really difficult

1311
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:42,047
To tell what's leading what

1312
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,095
You wouldn't

1313
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:45,119
Never

1314
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:47,167
Mistake this for not

1315
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:48,191
A sponsored

1316
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,215
Bit of

1317
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:53,567
Whereas in the present-day and closer to the present day

1318
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:54,847
That line blurs

1319
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:55,871
Quite a bit

1320
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:58,687
Yeah this is very clearly this is

1321
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:02,783
The segment where I'm going to make money by letting this guy try and make money

1322
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:03,807
That's the SEC

1323
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:10,463
We all know it I can't say that Alex even makes clear while there I think it's actually just after the

1324
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,743
Guy leaves

1325
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:14,303
He pays for all of the bandwidth

1326
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:16,607
Stuff on shortwave

1327
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:17,631
So like

1328
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:19,167
He pays for all of that

1329
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:20,959
And in exchange she comes on and

1330
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:26,591
They sell his water filter and I'm sure baby Alex makes money on top of that

1331
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:28,639
Play to get to taste of each

1332
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:29,407
Filter

1333
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:31,199
Ethically speaking

1334
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:34,015
You know you're not trying to

1335
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:37,855
Firestone on anybody

1336
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:40,415
Cannabis it really does come down to like

1337
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:47,071
Are you focusing on an exaggerating water-based issues in order to sell water filters

1338
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:49,119
And ignoring

1339
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:51,935
Other real water issues like

1340
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:58,335
You know parts of the country that don't have access to Clearwater because those aren't people who could afford your water filter

1341
01:07:58,591 --> 01:07:59,359
Wayfair

1342
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:01,919
Angles in math

1343
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:04,735
But in terms of like just trying to be like

1344
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:06,783
We're not doing today

1345
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,063
That seems to be a bit

1346
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:10,879
Yeah yeah yeah the ethical issues

1347
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:13,695
With this are more similar to like when

1348
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:15,743
Breakfast cereal showed you what a balance

1349
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:16,767
What's breakfast look like

1350
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,047
And it was like

1351
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:20,095
Bacon eggs ham

1352
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:22,143
6 pieces of fruit

1353
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:24,703
Two glasses of milk and orange juice all to make it

1354
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:30,335
It seemed like the amount of sugar you were wondering marshmallow

1355
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:32,639
Yeah yeah there's there's some information missing

1356
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:35,199
On the 10th

1357
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:36,991
Skulls

1358
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:39,039
Detox dolls in pass man

1359
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:40,063
Tell you what

1360
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:40,831
He

1361
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:41,855
Takes calls

1362
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:43,135
Why do the same people

1363
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:46,207
That does some true

1364
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:48,767
Man

1365
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:55,423
Metal Man in the same way that he's not going to sell out a theater without giving away tickets he's not going to open the phones

1366
01:08:55,679 --> 01:09:00,031
Not the same f****** people calling in Louisiana

1367
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:03,103
Oh good I can't handle another Christmas message you no no no

1368
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:05,663
It's another character that we know though

1369
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:10,271
Is it old man house phone it's Dan Illinois

1370
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:12,319
She's on

1371
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:13,599
All the time

1372
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:17,695
He gets out he must have the hotline number cuz he is constantly on

1373
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:24,095
And I don't I don't play every time he's around because I don't want it to be excessive like I'm Dan I live in Illinois

1374
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:25,375
Play this guy's Dan Illinois

1375
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:27,679
It's not the co-host of info

1376
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:28,703
No

1377
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:32,031
This this Bears match

1378
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:32,799
I think you might be

1379
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:33,823
Maybe somebody

1380
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:43,039
Are you doing Alex

1381
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:45,599
I'm going to confuse about all this

1382
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:46,623
Protesting against

1383
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:47,391
Mel Gibson

1384
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,671
Anything else like that

1385
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:57,887
Where is a thing

1386
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,679
Christian's brother exist

1387
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:00,703
Believe In Christ

1388
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:01,471
Scott

1389
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:03,775
Which people by their

1390
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,127
Hope he wasn't

1391
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:09,663
Gotti was a blasphemer like

1392
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:12,735
It says in the Bible

1393
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:21,439
Trulia

1394
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:22,975
Is it more of a Jewish

1395
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:25,791
I am going

1396
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:26,559
2 Chainz

1397
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:31,423
My name in Illinois I don't want to be associated with from Illinois

1398
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:37,823
Problem that people have with your religion isn't so much the religion part so much as the part where

1399
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:38,591
It makes you go

1400
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:41,663
They don't believe Jesus is God

1401
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:44,991
And they that means that they believe that he's a blasphemer

1402
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:48,319
So obviously we need to get one that's the religion part that's

1403
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:51,391
The problem comes into conflict sure

1404
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,159
Usher

1405
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:55,487
The idea that

1406
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:59,839
There is a I guess a failing of other people because

1407
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:00,863
They have not

1408
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:02,655
Become part of your religion

1409
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:05,471
That that that is where

1410
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:07,263
Comes it causes problems

1411
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:10,591
Like here's the thing nobody's mad if you say merry

1412
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:11,871
Christmas to them

1413
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:13,919
Generally people are mad if you say

1414
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:18,527
You have to celebrate Christmas and if you don't see Merry Christmas back to me you're the

1415
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:19,295
Devil

1416
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,319
Right right

1417
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:24,415
I'm perfectly happy to say Merry Christmas or happy holidays to anybody

1418
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,439
Whatever wine

1419
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:29,279
I don't want someone yelling at me

1420
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:33,119
There's no war on River my end

1421
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,655
Nevermind

1422
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:35,935
My Warriors

1423
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:38,751
Play be alone.

1424
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:39,519
Stop

1425
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:42,847
Annoy

1426
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:44,127
Prick

1427
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:48,479
Alex gets another call and then another thing that happens

1428
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:50,783
Is a b in 2003

1429
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:51,551
Is

1430
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,087
Colors call-in

1431
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:55,135
Maybe Alex's like

1432
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:56,671
Coast to Coast training

1433
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:59,487
Is the colors of Colin with

1434
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:00,255
Silly idea

1435
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:02,559
And kiwi

1436
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:06,655
Let's roll with that type of humor people

1437
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:09,215
I wanted to go into something else I think

1438
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:10,239
Interesting

1439
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:11,519
And I want to know if

1440
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:12,287
You heard anything

1441
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:13,055
Think about this

1442
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,591
Someone told us

1443
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:16,383
Know someone in washing

1444
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:17,407
DC

1445
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,431
That

1446
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:19,711
Behind

1447
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:20,991
Control Talib

1448
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:22,527
Before the year 2000

1449
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:23,551
1060 route

1450
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:25,343
To relocate with their families

1451
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:27,903
Because

1452
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:36,351
East Coast

1453
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:38,143
Caribbean

1454
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:49,407
So this caller is asking

1455
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:52,479
Based on Intel that she has got

1456
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:53,503
Higher-ups

1457
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:54,271
Have a plan

1458
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:56,063
Time to evacuate B

1459
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:57,343
2006

1460
01:12:57,855 --> 01:13:01,439
And Alex's responses are B up Island

1461
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:06,047
You have no idea how about you think that they're trying to escape but you don't even

1462
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:07,583
Know how much they're trying to

1463
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:10,143
Escape I know they're trying to escape

1464
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:14,751
So much more than you did that I'm the most knowing that they are trying to escape yeah

1465
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:16,287
You think you got intelligence

1466
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:19,615
You Maria Bamford character with whatever voice that is

1467
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:26,527
This is a yes this is a signing off like if you're this person whose call again you're going to leave this phone call with

1468
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:31,135
Boy my Intel is good wow Alex has

1469
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:37,279
Those people who told me that insane thing are very trustworthy people and I can't wait to hear what they have

1470
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:38,303
To say next

1471
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:42,655
Things like maybe people who are

1472
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:45,215
Literally in an episode

1473
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:49,311
What does today

1474
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:50,079
Very

1475
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:53,151
What what I'm getting at is

1476
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:54,175
The definition

1477
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:56,479
Koto 23,000

1478
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:57,759
15

1479
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:59,039
Telegrafi

1480
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:00,831
The meaning of United States is

1481
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:11,071
Point that I want to make

1482
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:11,839
Here is

1483
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:17,471
Softer

1484
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:18,751
On the court system

1485
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:23,871
What is it that you protect you protect your driver's license look at your driver's license

1486
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:26,431
Her name is spelled all capital letters

1487
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:33,599
Human looking for Doom

1488
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:36,415
Your corporation Drive Comfort Inn

1489
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:40,511
I definitely need to turn around

1490
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:41,535
Is our courts

1491
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:42,815
Alternative

1492
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:44,607
Coronavirus

1493
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:52,799
Right right

1494
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:57,919
Yep they found common ground and weird sovereign

1495
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:58,943
Some s***

1496
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:02,015
Just call in with some

1497
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:08,415
Silly nonsense and Alex is going to be like you bet this is this all works for me

1498
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:10,207
This comports with

1499
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:11,231
My

1500
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:13,279
Bizarre right-wing weirdo Dennis

1501
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:14,559
But

1502
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:15,839
Unfortunately

1503
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:16,863
Sometimes

1504
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:19,423
Other callers who have ideas

1505
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:20,703
That run counter

1506
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:22,751
To Alex's

1507
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:24,543
Third world

1508
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:26,591
Haha and this can't stand

1509
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:28,127
And Alex has to push back on

1510
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:29,663
For instance

1511
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:31,199
Another call

1512
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:32,479
It's from a guy

1513
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:33,759
2

1514
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:35,551
He's actually read operation North

1515
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:39,647
Oh no and has a little bit of a concern

1516
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:46,047
About how what could be a concern for somebody who's actually read it well it doesn't necessarily say like

1517
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:46,815
People are going to be

1518
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:50,655
Kill. There's that problem

1519
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:58,079
Military forces

1520
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:06,271
I got page 9

1521
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:11,903
In route to Florida real or

1522
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:20,863
It just talked about

1523
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:21,631
You're not

1524
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:24,703
Shooting archery

1525
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:27,263
Just talking about the

1526
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:29,311
What about the unarmed vessel

1527
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:36,223
Dementia

1528
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:46,719
Yasso

1529
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:52,095
Who just bullying

1530
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:53,631
But Alex is doing

1531
01:16:53,887 --> 01:17:00,031
Has rehearsed talking points about Northwoods which he uses to lend undeserved support to his conspiracies about things like

1532
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:02,847
9/11 and the event recent Beltway Sniper attacks

1533
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:06,175
Going to stand up to a person just reading the doctor

1534
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:08,223
This is dicey territory

1535
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:11,551
Two things that you see demonstrated in that clip

1536
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:14,879
The first thing is the Absurd victory

1537
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:16,415
But he claims over this collar

1538
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:19,231
Exclaims of the document says that the globalist

1539
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:23,583
Paramilitary forces will shoot people in DC in Miami and then explains

1540
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:24,863
How to set up

1541
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,655
This isn't really a cure

1542
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:31,519
The document talks about developing a communist Cuban Terror plot quote

1543
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:34,591
Cuban refugees seeking Haven in the United

1544
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:38,943
This would involve killing anyone or any paramilitary group

1545
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:40,991
Although it does say it may involve

1546
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:42,015
Up to wound

1547
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:46,367
They also say that quote via agents

1548
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:50,975
And the release of prepare documents substantiating Cuban involvement would be helpful

1549
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:53,535
In projecting the idea of an irresponsible

1550
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:57,631
This is fairly close to discussing how to blame a patsy but

1551
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:58,655
It's unclear if

1552
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:01,727
The Cuban agents they're referring to dates will be blamed for anything

1553
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:05,311
Where's the goal would just be to arrest some agents in order to create public

1554
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:07,359
Perception that they should be to blame

1555
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:08,127
Or

1556
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:10,943
There's even parts of this plan

1557
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:16,063
That suggests using Cuban Friendly's in order to pretend to be

1558
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:20,671
Cuban communist in order to make it look like they were attacking something

1559
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:25,279
These Cuban agents might even be dummies later.

1560
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:29,375
Yeah it's splitting hairs a little bit here so I'm going to go ahead and give Alex half-credit

1561
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:33,215
The document does suggest creating false perception but who's to blame

1562
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:34,239
False

1563
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,519
Fake attacks whatever

1564
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:40,127
The colors that reads the part about sinking real or simulated chip

1565
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:43,967
Refugees and I suspect

1566
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:45,759
Closest he's going to get to a win

1567
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:47,807
So you pretend that this fully supports

1568
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:49,087
What can you just claim

1569
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:49,855
But it does

1570
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:54,719
I don't need The Disappearance of a win in order to protect the air of frustration

1571
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:55,999
And that he's always right with

1572
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:56,767
People questioning

1573
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:58,815
This goes a long way toward

1574
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:00,351
The second aspect

1575
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:04,959
Does this clip putting that in motion which is the force the color to accept the notion

1576
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:06,495
Everything is vague

1577
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:09,567
And because of that all of Alex's unsupported and extreme

1578
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:11,359
Conclusions are actually what the

1579
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:13,151
It's Adam

1580
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:16,735
Man with the collar read the words on the page that aren't there

1581
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:19,039
Because Alex insist that they are

1582
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:21,855
And it's something that the audience watches and on

1583
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:23,391
Some level they probably understand

1584
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:28,511
Yeah Alex understands reality better than you do so you need to subvert your reality to him

1585
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:30,815
It is very bizarre and scary masks

1586
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:32,607
It's the most f*****-up

1587
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:34,143
Example of

1588
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,167
Just

1589
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:35,935
I mean

1590
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:38,495
It's it's a big bully with authority

1591
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:40,287
While you're holding a book

1592
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:44,127
Yelling at you to say that the book says what they tell you

1593
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:45,919
Doesn't matter what the book says

1594
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:47,199
You say what they say

1595
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:48,479
Yeah and it's

1596
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:49,759
Work

1597
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:50,783
And that it work

1598
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:51,807
Over the phone

1599
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:53,599
F***** up

1600
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:54,879
Manuel that's me

1601
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:57,183
Extreme ^ balance exactly

1602
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:03,071
Like I can get it more if it's Alex's in imposing frame on your like on a desk

1603
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:04,863
You know like trying to read

1604
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:06,143
Quietly and he's got his

1605
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:07,935
Big ass up in front of your butt

1606
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:11,263
Over-the-phone Manchester know I'm reading the sentence

1607
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:15,872
I was I was reading through Northwoods

1608
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:17,152
I'm trying to find Blake

1609
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:19,200
The instances of things that

1610
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:21,504
Could be construed as

1611
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,272
Like

1612
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:23,808
Actual viola

1613
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:24,832
Paris

1614
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:25,600
Suggestion

1615
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:26,624
And

1616
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,184
The closest thing really is

1617
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:33,280
That's sinking a boat load of cute Cuban refugees on Route 2

1618
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:34,560
Florida

1619
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:36,096
Disease does real or simulated

1620
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:40,192
Right kind of the closest thing you're going to get in there

1621
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:40,960
And

1622
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:42,496
I mean

1623
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:43,776
I think

1624
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:46,336
Even in the context of the document

1625
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:47,872
And the other stuff they're saying

1626
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:49,920
Even a real thinking

1627
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:54,528
Of the boat wouldn't involve be like

1628
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:57,600
It's a real boat we're really thinking it and then

1629
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:58,880
There will be life raft

1630
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:03,488
Red stuff for everybody or whatever the people who are on board will be

1631
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:05,280
Well I mean

1632
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:07,328
But that's the point of the point of

1633
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:08,096
The document

1634
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:09,632
Is coming up with

1635
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:11,168
A plan that isn't

1636
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:12,704
Let's just go blow people up

1637
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:19,104
You know the whole idea is very easy for them just to do so if that were the goal you would not need

1638
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,640
If we wanted violence

1639
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:25,248
Violence is our Jam man weave

1640
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:27,040
You know

1641
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:30,112
Make no mistake

1642
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:33,184
The proposals listed in that document would lead to a whole lot of

1643
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:39,584
Call goal of it being to provide a justification to attack you before they had time to enter

1644
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,608
Mutual defense pact with

1645
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:41,632
Soviet Union

1646
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:43,936
Even the suggestion that they have about just

1647
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:45,216
Harassing cubic

1648
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:47,008
Could have severe consequences

1649
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:50,848
Leaving aside any of the false flag ideas you might take away from the

1650
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,384
It was a bad doctor

1651
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,664
Good thing it was

1652
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,688
Was flatly rejected

1653
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:56,992
Because it would have resulted in a ton of death

1654
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,808
However none of that death will be due to the false flag

1655
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:01,344
Eggs that were suggested in the tech

1656
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,624
That's just something Alex

1657
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:04,416
Dentist

1658
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:05,184
Right

1659
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:11,584
I know there's another thing that people don't bring up often enough about that operation Northwood

1660
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,888
Incredibly stupid plan

1661
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,704
Not very well it's a bad plan

1662
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:19,264
It's it's not going to achieve the goals

1663
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:21,056
But they think it's going to

1664
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:22,336
Probably not

1665
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:24,384
And it's also not a plan

1666
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,688
Sort of 8

1667
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:31,552
Elevator

1668
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:37,952
Throwing spaghetti at the wall coordinated

1669
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:39,232
Obviously it's

1670
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:44,864
The NSA Whoever has the document that was released

1671
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:46,912
The full thing is 15 pages

1672
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:47,936
But

1673
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:50,496
Only a few pages of the actual

1674
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:51,520
The other other

1675
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:54,848
Sheets like the cover page and stuff like that

1676
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:56,640
It's not a long

1677
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:58,688
None of it is

1678
01:22:59,200 --> 01:22:59,712
Like

1679
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:03,296
Very well-articulated about how these plans would work

1680
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:06,112
Like one of the plans they have is just like

1681
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:08,928
Start rumors and then the bread season

1682
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:10,976
Lots of them

1683
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:14,048
It does feel like it's more of a

1684
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:16,352
Picture of a whiteboard of like one of those

1685
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:22,240
Giant school classroom white boards with everybody's ideas written on it really small then somebody just took a

1686
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:23,008
A picture

1687
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:24,032
Ml

1688
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:25,568
What's the plan

1689
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:28,640
The the the actual

1690
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:29,920
Appendix

1691
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:32,224
Which is where

1692
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:32,992
The actual

1693
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:34,272
Be the sort of description

1694
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:35,296
Plans

1695
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:37,088
RN starts on page

1696
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:37,856
10

1697
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:47,584
Yeah the reason that it's confusing is because there is there's a numbering of the pages

1698
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,376
From the original

1699
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:53,984
At the bottom of the page right and what page it is in terms of be like 15 page

1700
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,264
Does that were released

1701
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,800
In terms of the pages that were released

1702
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:58,080
It starts on page 10

1703
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:01,152
And then it goes through

1704
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:02,432
Fifth

1705
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,224
So it it's just

1706
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,504
Those five pages

1707
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:07,808
And

1708
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:08,832
One of them

1709
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:10,624
Start rumors parentheses

1710
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:11,392
Money

1711
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:13,696
Use clandestine radio

1712
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:17,280
Yeah

1713
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:19,328
Start rumors spread

1714
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:26,240
Just one though one of them is start riots and hear the Base main gate

1715
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:27,776
Friendly Cuban

1716
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:32,128
Not very specific

1717
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:33,408
Put up on the wall

1718
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:34,432
Go to

1719
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:35,200
Okay

1720
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:37,760
What else you got

1721
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:39,040
Large fires

1722
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:39,808
Scooters

1723
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:42,624
I like that scooters who got scooters put it up on the board

1724
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:44,928
So

1725
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:47,488
I heard children's hands

1726
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:50,816
With nothing else around it what it what it what was else going on

1727
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:52,096
Also apparently

1728
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:53,632
Outer space

1729
01:24:57,472 --> 01:24:58,240
For the spirit

1730
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:02,080
People

1731
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:20,000
Gavin accident

1732
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:22,560
I mean it

1733
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:27,680
Shadow Park

1734
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:34,848
How are you not picking out something

1735
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:36,128
Who cares

1736
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:41,248
Glenn Corbett

1737
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:42,016
Is

1738
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:43,552
Listen we just

1739
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:44,576
Figured out space

1740
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:45,344
Like

1741
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,112
Giada

1742
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:50,464
Figured it out some 1962

1743
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,256
And actually I looked at the date

1744
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:53,792
This is like

1745
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:56,864
Two weeks after John Glenn left

1746
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:57,632
Warriors versus

1747
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:59,936
Orbitz

1748
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:04,544
So now that we got that figured out obviously we also have the capability

1749
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:08,896
To knock it out of orbit magically actually hurting him

1750
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:09,664
Doubt

1751
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:11,968
Do you know what the

1752
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:14,016
Big problem with this is

1753
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:15,552
Oh boy

1754
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:17,088
When you say big

1755
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,392
That's a that's a relative value.

1756
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:21,440
What is the

1757
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:22,720
Premise

1758
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:26,048
Of these false flag like what to be desired and gold

1759
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:30,400
I believe it's to stop

1760
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:32,192
The Cuban

1761
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:33,472
From getting involved

1762
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:34,496
The thing

1763
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:36,032
It's to provide Justice

1764
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:37,312
Suffocation to attack

1765
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:38,592
Cuba

1766
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:41,152
So whatever you do

1767
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:42,688
Needs to be blamed on

1768
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:43,968
Cuba

1769
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:46,528
Cuba shot John Glenn out of

1770
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:49,600
Lidl

1771
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:56,000
Little Bill, all right now I'd I know that you and I would both think in order to

1772
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:58,560
Say shoot John Glenn out of space

1773
01:26:59,072 --> 01:26:59,840
You would me

1774
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:02,912
Rocket and Debbie capability to fire things in

1775
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:05,216
Likes of which worm

1776
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:08,288
Big short supply at that time

1777
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:11,104
So much so that they were all monitored

1778
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,128
All the time

1779
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:16,224
I mean like I guess you could make an argument that they have

1780
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,248
You know Alliance

1781
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:18,528
Swiffer Soviet Union

1782
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:20,064
And maybe they have rocket

1783
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:21,088
It's inside your butt

1784
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:21,856
At that point

1785
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:31,072
Not really baby daddy Cuba is like a

1786
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:33,120
Hey will get to you later

1787
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:33,888
We got

1788
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:35,936
Russia shooting people out of space

1789
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:36,960
Yeah

1790
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:39,520
John Glenn being false flag in space

1791
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:43,360
He's not going to be a Prius for war with Cuba

1792
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:44,896
Of all things

1793
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:47,456
Concept

1794
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,016
Actually convinced the world

1795
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:54,368
That John Glenn was shot out of space By by the Soviet Union

1796
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:55,904
The world war

1797
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:56,672
Right

1798
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:58,720
You can't just shoot a man out of space

1799
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:02,048
That's that's just everybody's got to solve that problem first

1800
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,328
That's my rule

1801
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:06,144
Okay where is

1802
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:10,496
View like sort of rules about no militarization of space coming to play

1803
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:11,776
I think they came into play

1804
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:13,824
Books like the 50s

1805
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,616
I'm not sure but if it was

1806
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:18,432
Before that then you could make an argument that it's the Wild West

1807
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:20,736
Yeah that's a point

1808
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:23,552
I didn't know it was wrong at the time

1809
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,112
Yeah

1810
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:28,672
I just think that this is stupid

1811
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:34,048
I got to say

1812
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:36,096
This is not

1813
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:43,264
Volkswagen Bug bunnies place mats

1814
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,800
Not on the list

1815
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:49,152
Alongside start rumors start rumors

1816
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:49,920
Steve Madden

1817
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:54,272
Parentheses is one of them John Glenn got shot out of space by Cuba and barrettes

1818
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:55,296
The fees are parentheses

1819
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:57,600
Here's another one of the suggestions now

1820
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:58,880
Consider the

1821
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:01,184
Jump

1822
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:02,976
Between this

1823
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:05,280
Baseball swag

1824
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:11,936
Log mortar shells from outside of Base interface somewhat damaged installation

1825
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:15,520
I have low-tech and high-tech operations at the same time

1826
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:21,920
People protect themselves against one of the other you can't be protected against both damn but use the word LOB

1827
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:24,224
Top shot put

1828
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,552
So throw couple grenades

1829
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:29,088
Nearby somebody's house

1830
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:32,928
I think maybe Alex doesn't have a great handle on this.

1831
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:34,976
Might not know might not

1832
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:38,560
Alex this is a fella from Denmark

1833
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:41,376
Very exciting to get an international caller

1834
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:45,216
Not so exciting find out that to you so maybe 90

1835
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:52,640
We have the arms of the Illuminati

1836
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:53,920
Time you attack Leelanau

1837
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:58,528
Corruption

1838
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:13,888
The Simon wiesenthal Center

1839
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:16,960
Probably Alexandra

1840
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:19,776
Island

1841
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:22,848
Management

1842
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,408
Maybe that late

1843
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,432
Kind of

1844
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:27,456
Connection Savannah

1845
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:28,480
Inflation

1846
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:31,552
Maybe

1847
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:33,856
Well there's a lot of organization

1848
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:34,880
It's a horrible thing

1849
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:38,464
Way to push back on that

1850
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:39,232
It's so Horace

1851
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:41,792
It's so horrible to be called racist

1852
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,096
Yeah that's all responses

1853
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:47,680
Good but both promised to call her and from Alex

1854
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:49,472
You know you

1855
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:50,752
Is it some

1856
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:53,056
Maybe startling

1857
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,336
To go back in

1858
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:56,128
You know just see the

1859
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,152
Kind of

1860
01:30:57,408 --> 01:31:00,480
Consistency of these types of colors

1861
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:02,784
Complete

1862
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,832
Inability or unwillingness

1863
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:05,600
2

1864
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:09,952
I'm stopping any meaningful what do you think

1865
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:12,512
Overtime that something would have changed

1866
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:15,072
In some weight like he would have gotten more

1867
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:16,864
Prepared for them or like

1868
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:20,704
Would be more capable of pushing back or more capable of

1869
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:27,872
The closing the closing the conversation down without having to go to help but it seems like it's been pretty much the same like

1870
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:29,920
Law Group

1871
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:36,320
Wish you hadn't said that Monday you know what you going to do that sounds nice actually I agree with you

1872
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:38,880
Could be forgiven I think if you're in Alex's audience

1873
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:41,440
If you came away with the impression that like

1874
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:45,024
He agrees with all of the most toxic awful

1875
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,304
Viewpoint

1876
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:47,584
But

1877
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:50,144
He doesn't want to say things to protect his own like

1878
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,424
Bottom line

1879
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:52,192
Or whatever

1880
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:53,472
Like I don't

1881
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:54,752
Think that's necessary

1882
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:56,032
Sara Lee the case

1883
01:31:57,312 --> 01:32:00,896
It would not be very difficult to talk yourself into it if you're listening to this and

1884
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:02,688
You know you have those

1885
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:04,992
Portable toxic

1886
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:11,392
I mean just based on all the non all the non word clue

1887
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:13,440
The non-verbal clues

1888
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:19,328
The tone of voice the way that he's pausing all of those little things could definitely make you add up to be in like

1889
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:20,864
Well he didn't say his

1890
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,144
1st and honest

1891
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:22,912
Response

1892
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:25,216
He said what he was supposed to to make the money

1893
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:28,288
Yeah the refusal to

1894
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:31,872
Even really recognize this guy is saying that like

1895
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:38,272
The Jews run all of these groups that you are saying our evil at are like out to get

1896
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:39,808
Patriots and Destroy Christian

1897
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:42,112
You're not even

1898
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:44,160
You just leaving that vert

1899
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:46,464
I'm telling you the things that you're telling me

1900
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:47,744
And you're just going like

1901
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:50,048
Maybe

1902
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:55,680
So this guy I would keep them on for a while and he asked him about that

1903
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:58,240
Denmarkian who hates Jews come on

1904
01:32:58,496 --> 01:33:00,544
He asked him about like opposition to

1905
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:01,312
To the EU

1906
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:03,104
And I

1907
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:03,872
That's wrong

1908
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:04,896
About the EU

1909
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:06,176
And then this guy

1910
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:08,224
It goes forward even more

1911
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:29,984
Most of them

1912
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:31,520
Even the juice

1913
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:38,432
I do know the Rothschild

1914
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:39,968
I control the meat to Hendon

1915
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:40,736
My two

1916
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:43,040
Alright Sir William

1917
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:44,320
Call from Denmark

1918
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:47,392
The word

1919
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:56,096
See how the Rothschilds run the media and then why you like to eat apparently

1920
01:33:56,352 --> 01:34:02,496
Those numbers are way off in terms of approval as I think he's very popular

1921
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:04,288
The inverse in both country

1922
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:06,592
Yeah I think you could probably find a couple

1923
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:10,176
I know that grease was a bit lower

1924
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:11,200
Pompeii

1925
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:14,016
Call me favorability about

1926
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:15,296
More than more than once

1927
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:18,112
Yeah I think I think now though

1928
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:22,976
Watching Everybody in the EU is watching Great Britain

1929
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:25,280
Eat itself alive and I think they're all like

1930
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:31,680
KB you douchebags

1931
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:34,752
Full disclosure the numbers that I was talking about or from 2,000

1932
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:35,520
22

1933
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:36,288
So like

1934
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:37,824
Stay relevant

1935
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,872
Bully 2 2003

1936
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:42,944
But I don't think that they've swung this far

1937
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:48,320
The median is 26% unfavorable 72% favorable

1938
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:52,672
Greece is the outlier here with 49% unfavorable 50

1939
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:58,304
I mean if you recall what happened whenever the 2008 financial collapse and they force

1940
01:34:58,560 --> 01:34:59,840
Disgrace to eat it

1941
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:01,120
Essentially

1942
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:02,912
Instead of writing off all of the debt

1943
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:03,680
Right

1944
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:07,264
Outside of the EU even

1945
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:10,080
Strong favorability

1946
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:13,920
Among the countries pulled by the Pew Research Center

1947
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:18,528
27% unfavorability among the 19 country medium

1948
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:19,808
But they they looked at

1949
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:22,368
9% favorable

1950
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:23,392
Hey

1951
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:27,744
So I don't know Alex is off of this guy's name from Denmark

1952
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:33,120
I just don't feel like maybe maybe anti-semites from Denmark and Alex

1953
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:36,192
Don't have their fingers on the pulse of the main

1954
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:43,104
Good chemistry you can tell how this call was falling apart there at the end and outside like

1955
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:45,408
You have to take care now

1956
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:51,552
This is the Alex fulfilling the promise of talking to the lawyer of the student

1957
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:53,344
From

1958
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,392
Stratford

1959
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:56,160
High School

1960
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:57,696
Yeah in South Carolina

1961
01:35:58,208 --> 01:36:00,768
Not a very long interview and

1962
01:36:01,024 --> 01:36:03,328
This caller he has ended

1963
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:05,120
Being there for some calls

1964
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:06,656
It's pretty unfortunate

1965
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:07,424
Because

1966
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:08,704
The

1967
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:11,520
The lawyer himself is blackmail

1968
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:13,568
And he brings up

1969
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:16,896
The dynamic Vincent play with

1970
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:19,968
The video recording of the actual raid

1971
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:24,064
Being similar in to the Rodney King

1972
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:25,088
Beating

1973
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:26,880
In terms of people being able to

1974
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:28,416
To see the actual thing

1975
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:29,696
Elicit an emotional

1976
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:30,720
Respond to people

1977
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:35,328
Experience it far more vividly than things they can only abstractly

1978
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:36,352
Think about

1979
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:43,264
Vanderbilt the number of callers call in and say how dare you compare this to rugby kick he was a horrible

1980
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:48,896
Criminal

1981
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:50,944
It's very

1982
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:51,712
Weird

1983
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:57,600
He seems like a just a lawyer who's trying to do a case

1984
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:59,392
And what have you

1985
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:01,184
I hadn't

1986
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:03,744
Actually does

1987
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,536
Kind of bring up the racial

1988
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:07,328
Dynamic interesting

1989
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:10,656
Yeah but it's on it's on societal unsatisfying

1990
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:11,680
Unfulfilling

1991
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:13,984
Dogs that are trained

1992
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:14,752
2

1993
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:16,544
Attack to train to be a

1994
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:18,080
Two police in there

1995
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:19,360
Police activity

1996
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:20,896
They're used to dealing with criminal

1997
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:22,176
Corsa

1998
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:24,736
Do the criminals in

1999
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:25,760
And to use that on

2000
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:27,296
On

2001
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:28,320
Age 30

2002
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:29,344
317

2003
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:32,672
Is the imagination

2004
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:33,952
Imagination

2005
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:35,488
Any one of our children going

2006
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:51,104
Well what

2007
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,664
What you said is very interesting and yeah and what we

2008
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:55,456
Founded

2009
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:56,224
If you can think back

2010
01:37:56,736 --> 01:37:57,248
60z used

2011
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:58,528
The police dog in those in

2012
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:02,880
Was that not only

2013
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:03,648
Only blackston

2014
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:05,952
Although this section of the hall

2015
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:08,512
Entrance for the

2016
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:09,536
The bus that was from

2017
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:11,072
More Rural and

2018
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:15,936
Okay

2019
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:22,336
Remind and reminds me of apartheid in South Africa

2020
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:23,872
Yeah it's a coincidence

2021
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:25,664
I mean

2022
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:30,528
You know if something reminds you of apartheid South Africa

2023
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:33,600
It's because you just regular all the part-time

2024
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:34,880
Where you are right now

2025
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:38,720
It's in it's not apartheid South Africa is apartheid

2026
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:39,744
South Carolina

2027
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,816
It's always been there that's where it lives

2028
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:44,096
It-it's

2029
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:47,168
Very easy to convince Alex and his acquaintance

2030
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:48,192
Unreal

2031
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:49,728
Brick is huge

2032
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:50,496
Bringing up

2033
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:52,544
The two-thirds of the students

2034
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:54,592
Who were caught up in the sweep

2035
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:56,128
Were African Americans

2036
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:58,688
And that

2037
01:38:58,944 --> 01:38:59,456
Is

2038
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:03,040
An issue and for the

2039
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:04,064
It's because the quince

2040
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:06,880
Incidents because there were white students

2041
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:09,440
Your 2/3

2042
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:11,744
Two-thirds were African-American 1/3

2043
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:12,512
Not every

2044
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:13,280
Working America

2045
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:14,816
Not if you

2046
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:18,912
Think that the school is 2/3 African-American

2047
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:21,472
Then maybe that is coincidental

2048
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:24,800
But when you recognize it under 25%

2049
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:27,360
Those numbers become

2050
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:28,384
Much worse

2051
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:34,016
Yeah they look real bad only if there's intent behind them I mean it makes

2052
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:34,784
Tubi

2053
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:37,088
The 2/3 number

2054
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,392
Far more disproportionately

2055
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:41,696
And it makes the

2056
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:44,256
The 20 30 33%

2057
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:46,816
The 130 other 1/3

2058
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:48,608
Much less

2059
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:49,888
Statistically relevant

2060
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:55,776
That's what this is the extent to which Alex

2061
01:39:57,824 --> 01:39:58,848
It's just baffling for me

2062
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:00,128
Like Alex does

2063
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:01,664
He brings it up

2064
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:04,480
She brings up apartheid South Africa

2065
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:07,296
Spencer's very strange to my meme

2066
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:08,320
What

2067
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:11,648
Okay

2068
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:12,928
Here's the problem I have

2069
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:17,536
Here's a problem I have and it's a big one and it's one that I don't think we're going to get around probably not

2070
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:21,120
If something reminds you of apartheid South Africa

2071
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:23,424
I don't care what that thing is

2072
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:25,472
It's a problem that needs to be fixed from the

2073
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:26,496
Bottom up

2074
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:30,848
If it reminds you of apartheid South Africa

2075
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:32,896
It needs to be destroyed

2076
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:34,688
So

2077
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:40,320
I don't understand how you could even bring that up about the movie and then and then be moved on

2078
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:44,672
Just be like hey that reminds me of South Africa

2079
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:46,976
No big deal alright well I'm going to keep going

2080
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:50,048
That is not okay

2081
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:51,840
They like it and apartheid South Africa

2082
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:55,936
Whatever it is

2083
01:40:57,472 --> 01:41:00,288
Fair enough enough

2084
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:05,664
Yeah well I mean your policy there I think is it sensible

2085
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:06,944
Move over it

2086
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:07,968
Yeah yeah yeah

2087
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:08,736
At least ask

2088
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:11,040
A number to follow-up questions.

2089
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:12,576
Don't accept

2090
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:16,672
Any excuse that it's a coincidence

2091
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:20,256
That's not the Alex Jones wife

2092
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:22,560
Infowars is not made for follow-up

2093
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:25,120
Coincidentally

2094
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:27,168
It's like sucks Africa

2095
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:31,776
Particularly when the thing that's reminiscent

2096
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:34,848
Is targeted harassment and a

2097
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:36,128
Abuse of black

2098
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:37,408
Yep

2099
01:41:37,664 --> 01:41:38,432
Yeah

2100
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:39,456
Anyway

2101
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:41,504
In the past

2102
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:44,064
There is some fun and there is some not fun

2103
01:41:44,576 --> 01:41:45,344
Ain't that the way

2104
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:47,392
Always love

2105
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:48,416
A nice

2106
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:52,256
Customer service call on are always fun

2107
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:53,024
The best

2108
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:58,912
Dogs are pretty sweet

2109
01:41:59,168 --> 01:42:02,240
There's something there's something about Louisiana Dentures message

2110
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:03,008
That is going

2111
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:09,408
To stick with me I'm going to be thinking about very sad

2112
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:12,224
Get another bite 27 Old voice that's possible

2113
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:15,040
Astro

2114
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:17,344
The nature of this stuff

2115
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,648
Looks like the new pretty

2116
01:42:19,904 --> 01:42:20,672
Frequent

2117
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:23,744
Instances of anti-Semitic collars that Alex has

2118
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:25,792
No ability to push back on

2119
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:31,936
And the fact that one of them is dead in Illinois who calls in every other every third show

2120
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:33,472
Get through concert

2121
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:35,520
Bentley is a regular that's

2122
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:36,800
Troubling

2123
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:42,432
Virus Thing 2

2124
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:43,712
Like it's just the

2125
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:45,504
The Echoes of the present

2126
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:47,296
And that in ways that are

2127
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:49,088
Kind of

2128
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,624
I mean it is

2129
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:52,416
It is

2130
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:55,488
One thing that I love about the past episodes

2131
01:42:55,744 --> 01:43:00,352
Is that they are emblematic of something that's so crucial

2132
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:02,656
Which is just a very simple

2133
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:05,216
If you don't deal with the problem it's going to get worse

2134
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:07,264
True you know

2135
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:10,336
So many we see so many things where it's like

2136
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:12,640
We didn't deal with a problem

2137
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:14,176
When did

2138
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:17,504
Information problem was there

2139
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:21,856
Every reason to think it would take care of itself kind of or like

2140
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:23,648
I suppose you know if you

2141
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:26,208
Take time to know about things

2142
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:27,232
You would hear these

2143
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:28,256
Things to be like

2144
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:33,120
Who's going to leave no idiot would buy me this noise and that's

2145
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:36,448
That's unfortunately turns out to have been a naive

2146
01:43:36,704 --> 01:43:37,216
Position

2147
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:39,776
Yep yeah that is

2148
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:43,360
What is the second element to event that is

2149
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:44,384
If you look back

2150
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:45,920
Opossum you see all the

2151
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:46,688
Dislike

2152
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:49,504
Constant similarity

2153
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:51,552
You know basically what you're saying

2154
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:53,088
As if you flip it

2155
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:54,368
It really does

2156
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,928
Put into perspective the way that Alex

2157
01:43:57,184 --> 01:43:57,696
Deals with

2158
01:43:57,952 --> 01:43:59,232
Like immediately

2159
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:04,352
And these stories that are breaking news now in the present-day that

2160
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:07,680
Breaking news 20 years ago they doing the same s*** it

2161
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:11,008
You know it kind of cuts both ways

2162
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:12,800
Ideally it should be able

2163
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:15,360
To illustrate somebody who's caught up in that

2164
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:16,896
Wright cycle that like

2165
01:44:17,152 --> 01:44:17,920
No this is

2166
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:18,944
This is the same

2167
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:19,968
That's all

2168
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:23,552
The carousel carousel

2169
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:24,832
Yeah I mean

2170
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:25,856
It's it's

2171
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:28,928
It's hard to it's hard to not think like

2172
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:32,256
Well this is a problem from then

2173
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:38,656
But you know like when we were talking about with the Bingo cards this is a problem this is the same problem from the same

2174
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:42,240
Bad thinking that's been going on for forever

2175
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:44,800
And it just never been dealt with

2176
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:46,592
Because either we never

2177
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:49,664
Found a successful way to deal with it

2178
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:52,736
Or we don't have the political or capital

2179
01:44:52,992 --> 01:44:55,552
Necessary to deal with the problem or the prior

2180
01:44:55,808 --> 01:44:57,856
Yeah I would have to be because

2181
01:44:58,368 --> 01:44:59,904
And it's so obvious

2182
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:04,768
The biggest problem we're having right now is most people don't believe in the real world

2183
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:08,864
Isn't that

2184
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:09,632
That

2185
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:11,424
Is the

2186
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:14,496
The place the the point

2187
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:15,520
From which

2188
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:16,800
The so many crap

2189
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:18,336
It is

2190
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:20,896
It's just we don't believe in the real world

2191
01:45:21,152 --> 01:45:26,784
Point where a lot of bulshit start spreading out how to make you believe in real

2192
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:28,320
The ultimate question

2193
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:29,600
And it's pretty

2194
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:33,696
Apparently to make people believe in on reality

2195
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:35,744
Czechoslovakian dog

2196
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,536
Oh my God

2197
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:40,096
Eastern European murder dogs from

2198
01:45:40,352 --> 01:45:41,376
20 years ago

2199
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:48,288
Another episode of a likely be as bomber ish

2200
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:52,128
Website.com

2201
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:54,432
We are on Twitter that knowledge underscore fight

2202
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:58,528
But until then I'm Neo I'm Leo I'm dzx

2203
01:45:58,784 --> 01:46:00,832
Clark

2204
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,536
I really feel like I should have thought of a

2205
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:11,072
A bit during the time away

2206
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:12,352
I had a whole week

2207
01:46:13,888 --> 01:46:15,936
Yeah but you were little failure in

2208
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:17,216
Non sinking about

2209
01:46:18,752 --> 01:46:19,264
True

2210
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:20,032
