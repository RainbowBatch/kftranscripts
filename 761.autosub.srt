1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect but knowledge B I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Dot-com

5
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:06,048
Exit around worship at the altar of Selena little bit about

6
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:06,816
Alex

7
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:10,912
Jones Auto

8
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,240
Something caught in my throat

9
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,544
Oh damn

10
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,824
Quick question

11
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,224
Well my bright spot today Jordan is that I finally got around to finishing

12
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:30,368
Better Call Saul finally made it through the last season

13
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,952
Spoiler

14
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:39,328
Pretty thoughts I guess so good not enough level

15
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,120
Baton

16
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,912
That is fair always

17
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:49,312
Love that Lavell Crawford

18
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:53,408
So that's always near and dear to my heart tour in comic 4

19
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:59,808
Before just landed up in a weird situation long before he was on Breaking Bad

20
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,344
He was on

21
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,648
80s comic shows

22
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,696
Regularly Elysium on there

23
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:10,816
Thought it was hilarious find me and my buddies had his CD taking a fat break

24
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:18,496
Clan MacLeod

25
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,800
I'm a large dude

26
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,568
We got it man

27
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:26,176
But you just soak the delivery so great week and my buddies got scolded

28
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:30,528
Because he came to Deja Vu The Comedy Club in Columbia we got

29
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,832
Scolded cuz we were laughing too hard

30
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:38,464
Man and his voice is so distinct in any really uses it well

31
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,232
Yeah

32
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,280
Some other thoughts that I had

33
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,304
That's it

34
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,328
I don't know

35
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,936
I thought it was I don't know if this is their intention

36
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,216
But I ran out of

37
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,544
Patience with the character of Saul

38
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,336
I think it is there.

39
00:02:54,592 --> 00:03:00,224
Yeah after six seasons how can you not be tired of a fast-talking con man

40
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,528
Well there's Thursday like pesos

41
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:07,904
Obviously that runs through especially like some of the earlier seasons

42
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,672
Turned in

43
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,208
To Saul Goodman

44
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:16,096
That is is pretty interesting like a person does terrible things but

45
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,632
What you feel for them actually

46
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,192
I just thought it was an interesting exercise

47
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,216
As in like

48
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,520
Where is the point where that has

49
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,080
We've had enough of that

50
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:30,688
Is it is intentional Bravo correct

51
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,480
Yeah

52
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,016
It's fascinating

53
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,552
The how how

54
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,600
What would I say

55
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,904
It's fairly difficult

56
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:40,928
2

57
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,744
Create a character that is

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,792
Morally bankrupt

59
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:49,120
And then still set your TV series with that

60
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,936
In as the hero in their own mind

61
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:52,960
You know

62
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,544
So he's traveling throughout this world and you see all these justification

63
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,312
Did you make

64
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,360
And you can feel the pesos of it right

65
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:03,968
But in real life you'll be like f****** s*** out of here for you man go

66
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:07,808
I also think it's not morally bankrupt enough

67
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,600
Do you know

68
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:16,000
I think there's a little bit of trying to take out of both bags if that's even a metaphor

69
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,583
But anyway it was enjoyable enough but I did resent that

70
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:25,471
It seemed to me that there were like 10 episodes of season the last season there were 13 but I didn't

71
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,543
It was fairly late at night

72
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:34,175
And I was like all right I'm on I'm on episode 835

73
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:34,943
Another app

74
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,759
Then you got to finish it

75
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:44,159
You can't not anyway with your bright my bright spot is

76
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,487
So

77
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,303
This is not a spoiler

78
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,143
Like Walt and Jesse Breaking Bad come back

79
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,679
For cameos

80
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:03,871
Got to say

81
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,711
Refreshing is hell

82
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,015
Zia's he Jessie

83
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,319
You know it right you forget

84
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,855
Like the amount of

85
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,647
Charm

86
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:21,535
It's like characters a lot of fun character that somehow you're like

87
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,071
Yeah man I'm route

88
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:26,399
For you while I'm not sure if that got old

89
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,239
Forgotten cuz it's been awhile since I watch Breaking

90
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,847
It does make me want to watch Breaking Bad again but I still have not

91
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:38,175
You know what's weird

92
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:44,575
Where is my response to Walt was this a******

93
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,671
Who knows

94
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:55,071
Viator up to doing that I apologize

95
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,095
Final Fantasy 9

96
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,191
Rice

97
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,983
Started doing the taco

98
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05,055
Started doing a Final Fantasy 1 through 50

99
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,871
Marathon

100
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,151
He's just going

101
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:15,807
I think he said that I think there's like an hour break but essentially he's just started them take a little nap he's been going on for 3

102
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,599
Days or something now I didn't dislike

103
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:22,975
50 to 3 hours straight if you trying to speed run

104
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,791
Okay is there even a record

105
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,863
Lydia strikebreakers adjust settings own

106
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,167
Assume that it what it really is

107
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,447
Is an active Ulta

108
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,239
Right somebody

109
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,263
Is going

110
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,031
To do that

111
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:41,407
So what he's doing is doing that in order to save the rest of the human race from half

112
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,199
Is he doing it for charity

113
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,991
No I don't think so

114
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:49,087
I have no idea this opportunity perhaps

115
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,647
Everybody's watching I'm not you

116
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,463
To it here's here's what I think

117
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
Thinking about

118
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:59,327
So I know I've only played the Final Fantasy 7 remake

119
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,607
At your best

120
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,167
No it's a modern game

121
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,959
Has like the Aesthetics of

122
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,983
Of a

123
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:10,335
Good a fairly current game and I've seen the original Final Fantasy

124
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,359
B7

125
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,943
Back wheels Graphics look like it was only gone

126
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,223
The seventh one

127
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
Right

128
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,783
Who's the first one like azure

129
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,831
It was

130
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,135
I mean I want to say it was more like

131
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,439
Did Doug you had like

132
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,791
Just pixels then you would walk up and then left and it'll be like you got into a fight

133
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,559
Near like

134
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,839
Fight and they're like

135
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,375
You won the fight

136
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,959
The first one was Bubble Bobble

137
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:41,055
It's shocking to me I mean that would even be fun

138
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,615
I mean I don't want to watch this guy play for like

139
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:47,967
Days at a time but it would be very interesting to see the evolution of

140
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,295
I like the style and the Aesthetics of it and like

141
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,831
That that would be

142
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:58,975
Let's be worth it to skim through and then I saw some of the

143
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:05,375
Video game and I sat there watching for like 15-20 minutes

144
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,143
I would be like

145
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:10,751
Okay with putting on in the background

146
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,799
And he's playing it

147
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,103
You slowly losing his mind Izu

148
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,407
At one point I think I turned it on

149
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:23,807
And he had not spoken for like a half hour I don't know what's going on I do think there's something so great about

150
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,343
Endurance-based

151
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,415
Comedy

152
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,695
There's something

153
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,975
So

154
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,743
Kindred

155
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,535
I feel to him doing

156
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:38,399
Something and absurd just because you know it needs

157
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:44,799
Like the George Lucas talk show with their life they special they did 30-something hours of all

158
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,847
All the live-action Star Wars movies

159
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,151
It's what you got to do

160
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:55,551
You end up going nuts do that sometime every episode of Infowars Marathon

161
00:08:55,807 --> 00:09:00,159
We will live that long we got to do okay

162
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:00,927
Somebody's going

163
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,719
Jordan today

164
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,487
We have an episode

165
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,815
To do it won't be days long

166
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,863
Situation

167
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:13,215
2003 episode

168
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,007
Okay here's why all right

169
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,591
I got down to business and I was I was I couldn't go back to

170
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,383
To the present we're going to check in on him

171
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,711
Clip of Alex from the 28th

172
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,735
So that was when

173
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
Gotcha

174
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,295
And I just was like I'm out

175
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:17,215
He sounds like s*** yeah why does it sound so shity a reminder Steven the audio he sounds like someone hit him with

176
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,799
The tranq darts like right before they started the show

177
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,079
It sounds

178
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,151
Sucks there's no spark of life in it

179
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:26,943
A-to-z

180
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:31,039
Bomber he doesn't go to calls

181
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:38,719
I got to get out of here man we got to talk about the present

182
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,279
I'm listening to this is making me sad

183
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,047
It's the end of the

184
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,095
The year I don't want to deal with that

185
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,375
He's just doing like

186
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,423
One of his big narratives

187
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,519
Was the covid-19 conspiracy theory that he's pretending is current but it's

188
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,311
The talking point that he had from January

189
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:57,407
Like he's just reusing it as if it's some new bombshell

190
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,943
Like I can't I can't do the

191
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,503
Anniversary of him make

192
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:07,903
Thing that b******* claim Sono your mind resets every year

193
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,927
Greatest reset

194
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:15,583
So I decided I'm going to stick around in December 2003

195
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,863
2003

196
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,399
And this

197
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,423
Is a roller

198
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,215
Okay

199
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,495
At the beginning

200
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,263
You're going to think

201
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,055
You're going to be really serious about it

202
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:25,823
And then

203
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,127
You still going to be a little mad but there's some fun

204
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:32,223
The first Jordan let's say hello.

205
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:38,623

00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,943
Unlove in 2012

226
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,831
Ari might still have been on the temperature

227
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:45,183
I'm wondering if this is a kony2012 take but I just think that whenever anybody much

228
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,719
2012

229
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,511

Thank you so much you're now

241
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,263
About

242
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,591
I'm a policy wonk

243
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,871
Alright so

244
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,895
We're in the past

245
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,943
December 11th 2000

246
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,503
I think it was first clip you're going to

247
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,783
To get why I said

248
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,319
This might be in a

249
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,111
Infuriating seeming episode

250
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,447
Call Kurt.

251
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,983
Poncho

252
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,263
Joining

253
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,871
Phyllis Schlafly is on but this

254
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,895
Twists

255
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,431
In a way that you wouldn't

256
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,711
Spectacularly

257
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:18,367
I'm probably over selling this in terms of it being some kind of like really fun thing but I found it remarkably

258
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,135
Ugly Entertainer

259
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:23,487
I also love the idea of Alex saying hello to the ships at sea

260
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,791
That was a that was a turn

261
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:31,167
I wasn't sure if he was on some sort of special broadcast for the troops

262
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:36,287
This is a Uso radio

263
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311
Yeah

264
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:43,711
So there's some new stories that Alex gets 2nd and here is the first one

265
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,503
And we're about to die

266
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,367
The website

267
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,863
Paramilitaries

268
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,399
Northern

269
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:19,807
Except

270
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:23,647
Did hold on

271
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:29,791
Play did he just say everybody doing for the last 24 years while

272
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,327
Market

273
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:35,679
We'll see this is why Alex was concerned about the euro

274
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,591
To this has to do with it

275
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,151
Trio of bombs that were detonated in Dublin

276
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:49,247
On May 17th 1974 ultimately killing 26

277
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,039
And injuring hundreds more

278
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,367
This was followed up by another bomb that went off in Mont

279
00:15:55,391 --> 00:16:01,535
2003 former Irish Supreme Court Judge Henry Barron Was preparing to release her

280
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,071
For detailing and investigation

281
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,863
Into British intelligence

282
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,631
Involvement

283
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,655
In the troubles

284
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,983
And one of the things that was a big takeaway was that British

285
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,775
Intelligence of likely cluded

286
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,335
With a loyalist terrorists in the carrying out of

287
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,615
These bombings

288
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,151
Everyone is shocked

289
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,199
This is awful but

290
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:24,063
Even the underlying report that Alex is using as a source stopped short of saying that it can be proved

291
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,343
Alex Azar

292
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,647
Uncertain and I'm careful about.

293
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,927
Detail

294
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:34,559
Another detail but Alex is getting wrong is that he saying that these bombings that British intelligence is suspected of involvement in

295
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,095
Happened in Northern Ireland

296
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,935
The two cities that they occurred in are both in Ireland

297
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:46,079
There's a pretty critical detail when you consider the Dynamics of Alex's ideas about false flags and all that

298
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:52,479
But you just get it wrong and then it's established and he moves on that's what was confusing me

299
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,527
Allegiances bombing Northern Ireland

300
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,831
To blame it on the Irish

301
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,879
But that's not what's happening

302
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,903
We just bombed

303
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,999
The IRA giving clandestine support to loyalist

304
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,023
Terrorist

305
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,303
In Ireland

306
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,095
That was

307
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,375
That's the story

308
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:12,959
In a way that would lead you to

309
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,775
The conclusion you came to

310
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,311
Cuz I mean historically

311
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:20,639
I'm going to I'm going to just go out on a limb here and I'm going to say

312
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,455
The British have not been on the Irish

313
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,223
Woodside

314
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,271
So Alex has this story

315
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,575
And a bit poorly

316
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,623
Natural gets details wrong

317
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,695
Nea like actual point

318
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:37,535
Of what this this aberrant the judge

319
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,583
Yeah I was putting out Dorothy

320
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,863
These stories are actually about

321
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:41,887
What

322
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,191
He does get back to another story

323
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,983
This was on our last episode

324
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,007
Seemed very strange

325
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,543
If you recall there was a judge

326
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,567
That said

327
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,335
Hey

328
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,615
If you said Jesus

329
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,151
Put you in jail

330
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,223
I do recall the prison

331
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,247
That was

332
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:02,367
I was very confused by this natural and Alex brings it back up

333
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,159
And we get some new details

334
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,055
Word

335
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,439
Facebook

336
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,607
Good for you

337
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,167
Little thing you should know about Samuel cat

338
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:51,007
I was going to say there's no way this guy is a cool dude

339
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:57,407
In 2009 he resigned his position is Judge instead of facing an impeachment hearing over charges that he sexually assaulted

340
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,943
Did multiple former employees

341
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:05,343
He ended up being sentenced to 33 months in prison for obstruction of justice involving those accusations

342
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,927
And in the course of it came out to that like he would tell

343
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:14,815
Repeat like people he was harassing that like I am the law sucks

344
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:21,215
I was trying to dig up his stuff about him saying that no one could say Jesus if his graduation but there weren't any stories of

345
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,239
About it from 2000

346
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,775
Three what you think there would be

347
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,823
If that was a true story

348
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,127
Fox News would have turned that into a

349
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,919
Years-long investigation

350
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,943
Multi here's the thing

351
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,223
What was poking around

352
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,783
Then I found an article on a Christian blog

353
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,575
And it started to come into Focus

354
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:41,439
Apparently this story about cat comes from a book by David Limbaugh

355
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,975
Titled persecution

356
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,023
How Liberals are Waging War against

357
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:45,791
Christian

358
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,583
According to this book

359
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,911
Kent made the proclamation in May 1995

360
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:57,823
Alex is reporting this as a present a story cuz he's probably just seen blogs that are repeating this thing that was published

361
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,103
In Limbaugh's book

362
00:19:59,359 --> 00:19:59,871
Which came out

363
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,663
In August 2003

364
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,711
Probably biking

365
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,479
He thinks that this is

366
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,295
The thing that just happened that's because of lazy

367
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,855
Opportunistic reporting that goes on in

368
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,647
Sensational ass

369
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,695
Victimization blog

370
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:20,351
This claim is reported all over apocalyptic Christian Media and its told differently in different venues

371
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:26,751
For instance it's often reported as a threat about a graduation in the outlets that want to appear more news like

372
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,103
John Hagee doomsday preacher wrote about Canton his book

373
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,383
Can America survive

374
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,663
10 Prosthetics signs

375
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,431
We are the

376
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,711
The terminal generation

377
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
And it hits

378
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,247
Two little different

379
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,551
For one thing

380
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:44,159
It isn't about graduation ceremony anymore at this time it's about anybody praying in school

381
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,463
It also seems a bit more severe

382
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,743
Quote

383
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,815
Anyone who thinks I'm kidding about this better think again

384
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:56,447
Anyone who violates these orders is going to wish that he or she had died as a child when this court gets through with it

385
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,215
Alright

386
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,287
Okay eventually we're going to have

387
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,847
How to deal with lying as a problem

388
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:08,223
Right they're going to wish they died as a child this is insane

389
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,503
What the f***

390
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,271
Is happening

391
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,831
I don't know what you can't just say this

392
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,647
So I looked around a little bit more and I was able to

393
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,952
Find some news for 1995

394
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,720
Explain with

395
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,000
Okay

396
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:24,864
In Galveston Texas a lawyer representing four students brought a suit against the school

397
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,888
System because they had

398
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,424
Formal prayers

399
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,216
Before graduation ceremonies

400
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:32,032
And before every home football game

401
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:35,872
Head because of folks also they routinely would hand out Bibles

402
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,176
What's on school ground

403
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,200
Sprout a Class Act

404
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:39,968
Action suit against

405
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,248
The school district

406
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:48,160
I can find no concrete evidence that can't ever said anything about people who said Jesus wishing they hadn't been born but VSCO

407
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:51,232
Did eventually make it all the way

408
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,280
In Santa Fe Independent School District

409
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,304
Versus do

410
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,608
Where the Court ruled that these prayers

411
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,912
Even if they were written and delivered by students

412
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,960
Constituted policy of the school

413
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,752
And therefore broke the establishment

414
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,520
Claws

415
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:10,176
Interesting bit of trivia the lawyer who represented the school district in their argument that the arm feel had it

416
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:14,016
Was Jay Sekulow

417
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:20,416
Who would go on to be one of Trump's top attorneys and they perjured himself during the impeachment hearings

418
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,440
Life

419
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:25,536
So weird characters my backup

420
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:30,144
Does make sense in a certain level in a hopeful way

421
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,472
You can't be that many people with

422
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,240
No shame

423
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:37,568
Right

424
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,616
The fact that they are recycling

425
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:42,176
It doesn't fly that like there's enough people who wouldn't

426
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:47,296
Show me so many nights on the on the chessboard you know you can't have more or less

427
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,320
Well I guess

428
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:52,672
I was going to I was going to robot that but this kind of works for your argument to and that is that like

429
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,952
There may be a

430
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,976
Honda of

431
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,256
People who have no shame

432
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,792
But there's only

433
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:04,192
A few who have any Talent over here.

434
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,216
Sacrifice Randolph

435
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:09,568
Anyway I don't know if these quotes that are being thrown around are accurate and

436
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,360
More likely what happened is that at

437
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:14,176
The judge said if they were going to have a prayer

438
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:14,944
Sectarian

439
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,784
Which is Being Framed as he was anti Jesus and if you say.

440
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,088
I will say however the same Kansas

441
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:24,928
Giant piece of s*** and if there's anyone that I think has the character

442
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,976
Possibly say something like that quote

443
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,816
I'm not going to say it's impossible that this

444
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,608
This quote is real but if it

445
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,376
Is

446
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,400
It's being used

447
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,680
Very out of context

448
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:42,080
And it happened in 1995 years later on Alex ascioti's pretending

449
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:44,896
It's a little bit more

450
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,456
Yeah I mean a guy who's

451
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:51,808
Documented is saying things along the lines of I am the law

452
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:58,208
May have allowed a couple of Judge Dredd punishments in his time it might have been

453
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,232
The government

454
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,864
I mean I was thinking about it

455
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,144
It would be

456
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,424
The jet like us

457
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,984
Covering something that happened in 24

458
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,520
As if it was

459
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,056
Like happening right

460
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,848
Floppy

461
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,616
That's terrible

462
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,640
Yeah let's

463
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,408
Parable

464
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,456
Anyway

465
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,480
Does mother bad news

466
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,584
You all want

467
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,864
You love everybody

468
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,936
You can read Harry Potter which is witchcraft

469
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,472
The craft activity

470
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,496
But if you're

471
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,520
If you're in kindergarten

472
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,544
And you pray

473
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,568
Over a snack

474
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,592
You go to jail

475
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,872
Are you getting rest

476
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,896
I don't

477
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,688
Understand how you could

478
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:53,760
Could not see the glaring difference between

479
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:57,856
The two even as an offhand comment of being like Oh but you can

480
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:01,440
Talk about witches in Harry Potter all day there's that you want like

481
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:04,256
That's so not similar to pray

482
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,328
And also

483
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,400
I don't think you can get arrested as a kindergartener you can

484
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,424
Antritis

485
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,472
An adult but only if we pray

486
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,008
3 states Mississippi

487
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:21,408
Is everyone could be tried as an adult in Mississippi Louisiana because sometimes how do you pronounce

488
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,688
Okay

489
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,736
Misses

490
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:31,136
Have you been hanging out with a guy makes copies Alex's table

491
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,696
Mississippi

492
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,768
So I'm Alex has some

493
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,632
Deceit about this whole story about the you going to jail

494
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,168
For saying Jesus

495
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,776
Worshiper

496
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,824
The Muslims wear their head

497
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,872
Dresses

498
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,480
Accepted

499
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,720
First Amendment

500
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,256
Everything I can tell it would have been

501
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,560
Totally fine for a student to thank Jesus in

502
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,328
Acceptance speech

503
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,472
These You Came. The prayers that were being held before football games and before the graduation ceremony

504
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,264
Do you like a actual formal Benedict

505
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:26,432
Typically in cases like this Alex needs to lie about details in order to make the situation seem more egregious than a text

506
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:30,528
2 years since the real world version of events is actually fairly sensible

507
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,320
If you're not a zealot

508
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,344
But you kind of get

509
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,368
What the point is

510
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,392
Yeah you can't do

511
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,184
Alex needs to like

512
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,952
Lie

513
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,488
Because it's

514
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,512
Acquired

515
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:45,376
In service of amplifying feelings of victimhood the only thing that makes any of these stories

516
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,400
Useful things

517
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,424
Well I mean

518
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,704
Fuel if he were

519
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,984
Not to lie

520
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,008
Then he would have

521
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,312
Have to as a free speech absolute

522
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,872
Be against prayer

523
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,896
Being in that school

524
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,712
I think you find a way around it

525
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,272
Well his way around it is lying

526
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,576
Butcher but you could lie differently

527
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:07,648
I feel like that doesn't

528
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,208
The fundamental thing that I say

529
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:13,792
You can preserve your free speech absolutism by lying about

530
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:16,096
A different thing

531
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,376
Right right

532
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:23,264
No I agree with you so you could like twice

533
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,800
That that's the Alex Jones Way

534
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,080
Alex

535
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,360
He's a good mind

536
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,896
To do something about this

537
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,200
He's going to do something about this

538
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,272
Letter writing

539
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,472
Diabetic

540
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:54,752
You're going to need a timer

541
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,896
And he's an impact all of our

542
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,712
I think if there was a judge you was like

543
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,504
You can't say Jesus

544
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:08,576
At your graduation or will put you in jail for 6 months

545
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:12,416
I would totally say Jesus as much as possible

546
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,464
F*** you

547
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,864
Yeah Lanvin ACLU would defend you from Bono

548
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,144
I do love this

549
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,752
I got a good mind to go back in time and belt

550
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:31,104
The most banal use for a time machine one could imagine

551
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,176
You don't like I think that there is something to be said for like

552
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:40,576
Like if you are a student there and this situation that I was lying about is actually the way he describes

553
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:43,136
You should go Jesus or something like that

554
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:48,000
This is an inappropriate effusive

555
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,352
Student I think would be well within their right

556
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,376
To do that

557
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,936
For Alex to go there just

558
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,960
To do that

559
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,728
An insane person

560
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:58,752
Right

561
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,288
Hind

562
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,568
Side of the realm of like

563
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,104
Principal and more like

564
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,896
Exactly

565
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:08,736
That really is how it feels

566
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:15,136
Kitchen for me Chef seems a little bit

567
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,672
Student protests would be

568
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:19,488
We talked about

569
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:22,304
Louisiana man tape man

570
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,120
Episode

571
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,400
No longer

572
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:32,544
Super effective to like 80% on Alex's tabulation but he keeps his mind

573
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,384
Hey running tabulated and I have some great news

574
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,152
Backup

575
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,968
Things are on the upward swing

576
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:40,736
Giving

577
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,016
Some people that

578
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,064
Still have refused to watch him

579
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,344
No

580
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,112
It's real

581
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,392
Don't want to come out of that

582
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,672
Sleepy world

583
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,464
Percentage

584
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,232
What you say

585
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:54,816
Let's one

586
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,840
We we get

587
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:56,608
Literally

588
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,888
99.9

589
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:58,912
Percent

590
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,448
They did they love

591
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,240
Bankruptcy

592
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:13,504
He's thinking this guy for what he's doing but I think

593
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,784
More what do you think

594
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,552
Infor is like

595
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,088
Thank you for giving me a

596
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,368
Chard

597
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,672
Hundred percent absolutely

598
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:25,280
I am no longer down in the dumps with Louisiana tape man we are cooking

599
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,328
79.9

600
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:33,728
Both of us know that 99.9 isn't absolutely insane number but it makes me feel a hell of a lot

601
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:40,128
You better I appreciate what you're doing sir but I cannot imagine that you're giving out enough tapes to have a decimal

602
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:40,896
104

603
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:44,480
Decibel point this is nonsense at least

604
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,504
1000

605
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,272
Yeah

606
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
Not a chance

607
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:51,904
So on his last show rrls episode weeks.

608
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,976
Salix having a conversation with his water filter sponsor

609
00:30:55,232 --> 00:31:01,120
And on this episode Alex has another bit of broker programming with his water filter sponsor

610
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:05,728
It's a different person I'm sorry the same company and they make the same joke

611
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,104
Quickly

612
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,712
Chiron

613
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,344
Special

614
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,952
Whitewater

615
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,608
Radio host

616
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,632
Just get 6 months

617
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,168
Imprisoned

618
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,960
Absolutely nuts

619
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,496
Let's see you say that

620
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:41,312
6 times and that's equivalent to being a judge

621
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,360
Convicted of sexual assault

622
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:47,200
Multiple employees Route 3 months more than that

623
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:50,016
That's what I mean this is just a little stale

624
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,808
So Phyllis Lyon

625
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,160
And she has she has some point

626
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,440
That she wants

627
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:04,352
For those who may not be as familiar with talked about Phyllis Laughlin quite a while it's been a long time but she has come up she's

628
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,888
Been on Infowars in the past

629
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,168
That we've discussed

630
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,960
She is an old school

631
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:13,056
Far-right anti-feminist

632
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,336
Anti-communist

633
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,128
Yeah I figure

634
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,176
John Birch Society Jason

635
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:21,248
You better involved with them and then started

636
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,016
The Eagle Forum

637
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:27,136
Which is largely a lot a lot of work to do with

638
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:32,768
Anti women's causes

639
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:38,656
CareSpot in history for it very very strongly Auntie reproductive health

640
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,424
Access

641
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:43,520
Very strongly against women and workplaces

642
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,824
Against women making

643
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,360
Decisions for themselves

644
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,176
Differently than that but

645
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,224
At the end of the day there's a lot of that

646
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:55,808
It's okay if she comes on and these are the

647
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,832
Issues

648
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:57,600
That are most

649
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,368
Important

650
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,024
Well I think

651
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,304
One of the biggest

652
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,608
Is the out-of-control federal court

653
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,424
The judicial activist

654
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,448
Are trying to

655
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,472
Play claw

656
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:14,752
How to do things

657
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,312
No elected legislature would do

658
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,104
I'm so we find

659
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,640
Jimenez attack

660
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,920
State after state

661
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:22,944
The dead rabbit

662
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
The Pledge of Allegiance

663
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:24,736
Deborah

664
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:25,504
The ten

665
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,296
And to redefine

666
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,064
Marriage

667
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,600
So the out-of-control court

668
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,368
Yes

669
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:34,976
So out of control control Pledge of Allegiance

670
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:35,744
Getting rid of

671
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,024
10th Amendment

672
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:42,912
What you mean by that is like ten commandments not being posted in government building

673
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:45,728
Natsu

674
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:49,056
People are moving towards marriage equality in

675
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:49,824
Makes her mad

676
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,104
They're out of control

677
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:56,480
So don't seem like very serious grievances that will tell me the country

678
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:59,808
If we don't have children saying the Pledge of Allegiance every morning

679
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,368
How will they learn 20 years later how

680
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:05,184
I'm saying it was for them to say the Pledge of Allegiance every morning

681
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,720
Right maybe I'm

682
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:10,816
Weird but I don't really have that much of a problem with a pledge of allegiance

683
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:14,656
I know it's a little bit f***** up and kind of weird

684
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,448
You know just conceptually but

685
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:19,264
I don't really think it affected me that much

686
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:25,152
Saying the Pledge everyday I never felt that I had actually pledged my allegiance to anything

687
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:30,272
Not really it was the formality or whatever and knowing more than any

688
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:33,600
A perfect world maybe it wouldn't be something that happens

689
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:39,488
But the priorities I realize I'm not sure that it indoctrinates kids or anything like I don't

690
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,512
I don't know it's

691
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,560
It's weird

692
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,608
Just from

693
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,632
Like what

694
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:52,032
It is a stamp

695
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:52,800
I could be convinced

696
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:54,848
We have

697
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,640
A staggering list

698
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,176
Problem

699
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,200
That effect

700
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:02,016
Every single thing that we do worldwide

701
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:06,112
Play through now if we're talking about dividing up

702
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:08,160
Energy necessary to solve

703
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:13,792
These problems I'm not going to put a lot of energy towards the Pledge of Allegiance sure that's kind of situation

704
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,072
Begone

705
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,632
There seem to be as fundamental issues

706
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,192
Schools in

707
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:20,960
Students

708
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,496
That would be

709
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:23,776
Much more important

710
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:30,176
I find I mean but fundamentally I find it insane to pledge ones allegiance to any country or govern

711
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,224
Body or anything along those lines

712
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,528
See that's why I could be sweat

713
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,600
I wouldn't pledge my allegiance in f******

714
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:38,880
You

715
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,720
You have to earn my allegiance on the

716
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:47,584
The daily every single day. Where's that cat

717
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:53,216
Alex and Slam Flea in here I don't know if you heard this story

718
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,240
About this judge

719
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,776
Bratz your talk with the attitude

720
00:35:56,032 --> 00:36:01,152
Control4 just judges hold marinade

721
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:01,920
Yeah

722
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:02,944
We cannot let the

723
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,224
The judges presume

724
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,248
To make law

725
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,040
Such as telling us

726
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,320
The Pledge of Allegiance

727
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,136
Probably can't have Mary

728
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,160
Why does a man and a woman

729
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,936
There's a quote from the judge

730
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,568
Quote

731
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,104
Marshall

732
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,688
Score

733
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,208
Houston Texas

734
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,000
Accountright

735
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,048
Is it outrageous or something

736
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:50,816
Constitute

737
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,352
Acknowledge

738
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,120
God

739
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,912
And this is why I am urging

740
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,448
That the US

741
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:58,240
Exercise its right

742
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,776
Established in

743
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,056
3 of the US,

744
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,360
2 West Rogers

745
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,640
Accord

746
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,176
Over the acknowledge

747
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:06,944
Mother of God

748
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:11,040
Telling that Alex can ramble off a story about Judge Kent is iffy

749
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,064
The current headline

750
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,880
Response to it without any awareness

751
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,184
She's just accepting Alex's framing

752
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,464
This was a big

753
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,000
In case in terms of religious

754
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,024
Expression at school

755
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:27,168
Like I said it ended up going all the way to the Supreme Court who made their ruling on it in June 2000

756
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,264
This is an eight-year-old story but at the point Alex's covering it

757
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,080
The ruling from the court is only three years back

758
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:38,944
Is it squarely in the Wheelhouse of both Alex and Felix Aviles

759
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,296
Right there on awareness of this is pretty f****** embarrassing

760
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:50,208
When Alex rattles office headline Phyllis should recognize what he's talking about in say that was eight years ago in that

761
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,488
Happened but she doesn't

762
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,024
He could be that

763
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,328
She doesn't know the case in which case

764
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:58,144
She clearly doesn't take the issue she's covering as seriously as she

765
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,544
She pretends to be the chinos full well that it's an old story but they pushing it as if its current is help

766
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:07,616
In terms of pushing her own narratives and the agenda

767
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:12,224
It's not that compelling to argue the courts need to be overhauled

768
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,760
Because of a news story from almost

769
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:16,064
The decade ago that such an on news

770
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,392
Everyone on this show thinks it happened last week

771
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,440
That's not going to really get the audience

772
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,208
Excited

773
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:23,744
You need that immediately

774
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,792
To make a threat to the audience feel press

775
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,328
Like I Need a Hero

776
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,096
Step Up

777
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,144
Victimization they're being told there

778
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,680
Right right

779
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,752
To be clear on this

780
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,544
This was already decide

781
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,336
In the Supreme Court

782
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:40,128
Yeah that's this point in time

783
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:40,896
3 years ago

784
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,968
Buy a d2000 supreme court if I

785
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,248
Recall correctly

786
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:49,344
The fight before Supreme Court that stole the election for Bush

787
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,624
Brett's not age

788
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,416
That's not it

789
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,464
Left-leaning judicial Act

790
00:38:55,488 --> 00:39:00,352
Here's where you're wrong

791
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:03,936
I forgot that Aleta was still on the left wing-back

792
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:04,704
2000

793
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,496
Alita was not on the

794
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,800
Court wait no

795
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,824
You was

796
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,104
Yeah

797
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:11,872
We wait

798
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:14,944
A 2000

799
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,736
Thomas was on the court hears what

800
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:17,504
Confused

801
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,808
Because the Supreme Court does come up

802
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:23,136
And Connor is a vote

803
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,160
Yeah

804
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,696
Aledo replaced her

805
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:32,096
And that's why I got confused because in this episode there is a mention of Every Day O'Connor

806
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,888
She's dead by 2000

807
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,680
Right I think she retired

808
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,216
Call Albert like what

809
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,264
What's up

810
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:45,408
Where do you place her on the ideological Spectrum

811
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,432
Very less

812
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,712
For now

813
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,760
But conservative

814
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,576
Apparently

815
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,856
She's a arch feminine

816
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,144
Those are real

817
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,424
Appointed by Republican

818
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,448
President

819
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:10,240
We're just simply

820
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,008
Somehow

821
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,288
Cheated or mislead

822
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,056
By the

823
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,592
By the people they appointed

824
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,384
For example

825
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,152
Ferrari

826
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:19,200
Appointed Sandra O'Connor

827
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,248
And he made the

828
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:23,040
Mistaken during his campaign

829
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,064
They're saying he was going to

830
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:24,832
Point of woman

831
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,880
And then she was the only woman

832
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:27,904
Shown

833
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,952
My guess is

834
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,512
He said to her Sandra of course you're pro-life aren't

835
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,792
She said of course

836
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,560
Surprised

837
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,352
And then she

838
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,400
Want to write

839
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,704
Took the appoint

840
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,472
My dad has

841
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,056
Things ever said

842
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,128
Too bad how they are

843
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,920
Reagan

844
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,200
Yeah that sounds right

845
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,992
Correction

846
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,808
Same bolita was not on the court until 2000

847
00:40:56,064 --> 00:41:02,208
6 yeah she retired in 2005 or newer retirement 2005

848
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,488
Are timelines a little bit off

849
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,768
What was the one that I was

850
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,560
Robert

851
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:10,144
No no it was

852
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,680
Ibaby is the Tony guy

853
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:14,752
I'm great at Supreme Court names

854
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,288
The guy who looks like a toad

855
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,312
I think he's dead now

856
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:22,944
The guy who looks like a toad you say

857
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,808
Sure I do that doesn't narrow it down as much as we'd like Connor is still alive

858
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,344
No s***

859
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,880
92 years Young

860
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,416
Could have could have swore she

861
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,976
How about that barely know

862
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:37,280
John Paul Stevens

863
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:40,352
Is everything else now I think Kennedy

864
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,120
Yes

865
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,400
Candidate David souter

866
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,448
Okay

867
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:48,032
Through

868
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,592
Every every Justice

869
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:53,407
Politically active at the age of 12

870
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:59,807
So I don't have all of the Supreme Court Justices from 2,000. Feel right to me that'll

871
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:03,647
Toledo would have been there that early

872
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:07,231
We all we all have time

873
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:10,303
Confusion

874
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:15,423
Yes accurate was appointed by Bush

875
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,727
A fair amount of the justices on the

876
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,007
Supreme Court are kind of like

877
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,567
In a lot of it does feel a bit like

878
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:26,943
You know just fill in the blank of things to grab onto

879
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,247
But yeah

880
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,039
So Sandra Day O'Connor

881
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:31,807
Noted

882
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:34,111
Are fairly conservative

883
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,647
Member of the Court

884
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,183
Was a

885
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:40,255
Big-time feminists to trick trick

886
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:44,351
It's just because you didn't overturn Roe v Wade

887
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,399
But they're responding to

888
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,703
So now I told you there's a little bit of a toy

889
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:51,775
And here's here's where it starts to come into play

890
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:53,567
I like

891
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,615
Might not understand

892
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,639
The way his audio

893
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,223
Because they don't like Phyllis Schlafly

894
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,503
What

895
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:05,599
Interesting she Pals around with

896
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,135
The neocon

897
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:09,183
Well that's fair support

898
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:11,231
Bushcutz bear she's support

899
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,279
What's the GOP in general

900
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,303
And

901
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,095
Alex is trying his audience

902
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,119
Understand

903
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,911
Set the neocon

904
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:19,935
Are all

905
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,215
Bucking communist

906
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:25,055
They are all trotskyite evil who are in disguise

907
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:29,407
Because the only people who are pure are the Ron Paul types

908
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:32,223
The real severely

909
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:36,063
Right-wing people who think that

910
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:40,671
Anybody like George Bush at his secret communist

911
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,975
Before those people were the governor

912
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:46,303
And now that that was back whenever the tables have turned

913
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,607
Do you know the the Neo cons were running everyday

914
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:52,191
Yeah and so Alex doesn't realize this and I don't think he expects

915
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:56,287
That to be the response that they get when they take calls spray

916
00:43:56,799 --> 00:44:00,127
So Phyllis is in there and they take calls and they're pretty hostile

917
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:07,551
Hey Alex

918
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:09,599
Thanks for the opportunity

919
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:13,951
Shuffle you don't followed you for years

920
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:17,023
I'd like to know what Grassroots movement you're going to get it

921
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:17,791
Involved with

922
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:19,583
No

923
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:22,143
Representative Ron Paul in Texas

924
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,191
In the middle of summer headache

925
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,727
Stop funds for UNESCO

926
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,775
A wonderful Amendment to the Giants

927
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:28,543
State

928
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,079
Commerce

929
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,127
I didn't hear a peep

930
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:35,967
Anything from Kelly shaft late to get on that know you may have done it

931
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:36,991
But you know

932
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:40,575
George Bush we knew George Bush when he was attacked

933
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,111
Workforce

934
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:44,159
Board nominees Workforce Development

935
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,695
Boards are running our counties

936
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:46,975
Running our town

937
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,255
Appointed

938
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,791
We are inundated

939
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:53,631
Confusion mr. Boyd chedelic that quits Indiana

940
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,679
UNESCO need 60 million dollars

941
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,703
All bad

942
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,799
Phyllis

943
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,591
Well you're right

944
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:06,175
And I was too tied up with other issues that I didn't get on the

945
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,455
Ernesto fight but I can

946
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,991
Completely agree with you

947
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,527
And everybody who

948
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:12,319
Who knows me knows that I oppose you

949
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,087
Enough

950
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,879
Getting out of your Nesco

951
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:15,647
Best things

952
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,415
Ronald Reagan

953
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:19,743
Well

954
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:24,351
I don't think there was a good reason.

955
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:27,167
Look I hate Phyllis Schlafly but she's being too polite

956
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,239
That's that's

957
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:32,031
There's got to be a feeling of like

958
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,311
Do you know who the

959
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:39,199
Exactly what I was thinking

960
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:39,967
What have

961
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,991
You done

962
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:47,135
I didn't work on the UNESCO fun do you even know what UNESCO f****** cares about

963
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,183
UNESCO

964
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:55,583
I am your favorite heads favorite skinhead

965
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,631
Before you were born

966
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:03,007
I was trying to limit people's rights when you were wearing short pants

967
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:07,871
For women could wear pants I was trying to keep them from wearing pants

968
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,407
That's how deep I go

969
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:14,527
Yeah this isn't like disrespectful honestly terrible yet

970
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:20,415
What you kind of like to see but it's quite a surprise to me that like

971
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:23,999
I thought they take calls and it would you know

972
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:28,095
Refined or boring

973
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:31,679
That's fascinating back then they hadn't

974
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:35,775
They didn't have the people in power so they were just trying to tear down every

975
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,055
Restructure

976
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,383
On the air go ahead

977
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,431
Hey are you guys doing

978
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,991
I kind of don't like

979
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,783
Take away that

980
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,063
You apologize

981
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:48,831
4

982
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:49,855
Republican Administration

983
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:50,623
I noticed that you

984
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,391
You said that

985
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,415
Reagan was

986
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,439
Full when I came

987
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,207
2

988
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,511
Saturday O'Connor

989
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,071
Phillips

990
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,399
Said that long beforehand that she's a pro board and now

991
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,167
Bush

992
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:06,239
I will tell you

993
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,263
Did I public

994
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,055
Opposed Pandora Connors

995
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:10,591
But at the time

996
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,407
Bush

997
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:14,687
Are you aware that

998
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,967
Miguel Estrada by the way

999
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:16,991
Is a pro board

1000
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:19,551
Wedding friend-of-the-court briefs on half-and-half

1001
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:20,575
Woman against pro-life

1002
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,367
I have heard

1003
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:23,903
Alright

1004
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:26,207
Now you can't tell me Bush wasn't aware of that

1005
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,023
I mean

1006
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:30,559
Bo Derek

1007
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,327
Excuse for that

1008
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,119
Well I guess

1009
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,143
Defending

1010
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,191
I don't know

1011
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:41,567
These people do not like her

1012
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:45,919
Just feel like they're coming at her with a lot of grievances that she has

1013
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:52,319
No control over whatsoever answers are fair I don't know ask him

1014
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,343
Look for him yeah

1015
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,415
Show me there is a fairness to that answer but like

1016
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:59,487
This is exactly what would happen

1017
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:00,767
Based on the way out

1018
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:01,535
His prime

1019
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:04,095
Anybody who's supporting bush

1020
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,119
Is

1021
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:12,031
Up to something or they're not ideologically pure enough whereas Phyllis Schlafly is been a major

1022
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,311
Part of building d

1023
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,591
Extreme right-wing

1024
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:15,871
The Alex and his audience

1025
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:16,895
To enjoy

1026
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:17,663
At this point

1027
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:19,455
Now at the same time

1028
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:22,271
She's also Savvy enough to understand that like

1029
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:24,063
All right there is a need

1030
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,623
For me to work within some

1031
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:31,487
Instructure is pursue these policy goals at the point when

1032
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,279
There is a possibility of getting a

1033
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,047
The past

1034
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:35,327
A pipe dream nonsense

1035
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,095
Things about

1036
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:39,167
Ron Paul ever even making it out of the primary

1037
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,447
It's not going to fly

1038
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,543
Beetle respect that they have no respect

1039
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:45,311
For the fact

1040
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,079
What you like

1041
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,127
Done here

1042
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:54,527
It's hard for them to buy the way I talk

1043
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:59,135
Love not heard of Provo pro-life

1044
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:01,695
Proboard I'm down for it that's what I've got

1045
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:04,255
But but it does

1046
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,279
It does feel like

1047
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:07,583
Concept

1048
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,631
Of exploiting the system

1049
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,679
Is not one that they are willing

1050
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:12,703
To accept you know like

1051
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:13,983
Definitely is not like

1052
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:14,751
Listen

1053
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:17,055
I agree with what Bush did about

1054
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:19,103
She's like listen I disagree with them too

1055
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,383
Can only ask

1056
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,175
Exploit what I can explain

1057
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:22,943
To accomplish

1058
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,479
The goals that you and I both

1059
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:27,039
I don't have the power

1060
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:29,599
To do whatever I want and just say

1061
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:37,791
It's a function I think of and idealism that was marrying Infowars back then that I don't think exist anymore

1062
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:42,143
Taking over a little bit.

1063
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:46,239
At this point there is like this idea but we have to have this expectation of

1064
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,775
Everybody Must

1065
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:50,335
You must demand them do everything

1066
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,359
Yeah that you want

1067
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,383
It's

1068
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,687
It's kind of interesting to see

1069
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,967
It run up again

1070
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,503
Someone like Phyllis Schlafly

1071
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:58,527
Right boot

1072
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,831
By all accounts be

1073
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:01,599
Royalty

1074
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,647
In the space

1075
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:07,743
That's it I mean yeah she that's like she built dizzy

1076
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,303
In terms of far-right being a piece of s***

1077
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,071
You know

1078
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,095
A big part of it

1079
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:13,119
Big Park

1080
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,911
So I just thought this was funny

1081
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:17,215
There's nothing really groundbreaking here but

1082
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:20,287
When they went to commercial Alex forgot to turn off his mic

1083
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:23,871
Wheeless

1084
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:28,223
The gravity filter

1085
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,759
Design

1086
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:38,975
+ 888

1087
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,535

Toll-free AAA

1089
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:45,887
3438

1090
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:54,335
I just had a fun night about that

1091
00:50:55,359 --> 00:51:01,503
I'll pick behind the curtain it doesn't need to be like s*** talking whenever somebody. You know whose Sole shoes in fun is that is

1092
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,295
Sometimes just

1093
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,063
What are the times

1094
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,183
Do you have a definite recognition that Alex

1095
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:09,951
Screening them

1096
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:13,535
Call 2002

1097
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:16,351
Just a little fun

1098
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:20,447
Back in the day this was such a weird operation that he could have them Mike's

1099
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,263
Ellen during commercial what fun

1100
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,567
Anyway Phyllis leaves

1101
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:30,431
Man I feel bad for a little bit not really cuz you suck

1102
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,455
I feel bad

1103
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:37,855
Cuz as soon as she leaves Alex Tarkan talkingshit on her

1104
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:40,415
He's doing a little dirty

1105
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,351
Rosewater corruption

1106
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:00,383
You're a communist if you're not for it

1107
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,759
Where is

1108
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,295
Well I don't know why

1109
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:12,415
Have a great travel

1110
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:17,535
Mike

1111
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:20,863
Do a little disrespectful impression and

1112
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:26,239
If that's something that she's playing Coy like I don't know

1113
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:30,079
Securities is like any time we've ever guessed it on a live show that can

1114
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:32,383
Continues after we've left

1115
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:35,199
Like the fear is the moment we get off there

1116
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:35,967
Just going to start talking

1117
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:39,039
Consider these assholes

1118
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:41,087
But I know that the

1119
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:42,367
Good better good hose

1120
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,647
Just would never do that

1121
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:44,671
That right you know

1122
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:51,327
So to have him do it both reinforces a good host would never do that and also it could happen to you

1123
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,607
You

1124
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,655
I thought I found it just tastes

1125
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:58,495
But then also the other thing too that you noticing that clip is this

1126
00:52:58,751 --> 00:52:59,519
Like just

1127
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:02,079
Consistent things that Alex does

1128
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:05,663
Where you have something that key Zappos

1129
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,943
Was too or bad

1130
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:13,343
And the only way he can talk about it is also by pointing out something else that's bad

1131
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,647
You are mad at her butt

1132
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:16,415
Ann Coulter

1133
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,439
So much worse

1134
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,207
Right

1135
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:21,279
There's that deflector anything that is just

1136
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:24,095
Use can't deal with anything on it

1137
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,119
Its own term

1138
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:31,263
It's almost the apotheosis of that like choose the lesser of two evils concept

1139
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:35,871
He's like that's literally his guiding principle of like oh I found this thing was bad

1140
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,943
But mathematically this things worse

1141
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,223
So I guess I'm cool with this

1142
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:44,575
And yet at the same time you can't do that as it relates to

1143
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:46,367
The GOP

1144
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,415
Wild

1145
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:49,439
Yeah

1146
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:53,023
But the holders continue

1147
00:53:58,911 --> 00:53:59,935
I would like to talk

1148
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,983
Because I would have liked to ask her if she wants

1149
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,519
White 911 the road

1150
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,311
Centuries OverWatch

1151
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:07,615
I don't know

1152
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:09,919
And also not a creature from Jekyll Island

1153
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:13,247
She was chews friends of G Edward Griffin

1154
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:16,063
What are you talkin about she ever read

1155
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:20,415
Creature from Jekyll Island pets to probably has a special thanks in the book

1156
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:23,231
It's crazy

1157
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:24,511
Crazy

1158
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:25,791
That's a wild

1159
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:27,327
It's a code

1160
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,887
Do you think she ever read creature from Jekyll Island

1161
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:31,167
Like ask

1162
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:33,983
G Edward Griffin what he thinks about Phyllis Schlafly

1163
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:36,031
Addario yeah yeah

1164
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,567
Man

1165
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:40,895
They just eat their own they just do

1166
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:43,199
You know the cycle for these right-wing

1167
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:44,223
Shitheadsteve

1168
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:46,271
Is that that rap lyrics

1169
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:48,063
I'm who your favorite MC tells

1170
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:48,831
The kids about

1171
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:52,159
Schlafly is to these assholes

1172
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,183
But it is

1173
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:57,023
It is like a generational tide almost you know like

1174
00:54:57,279 --> 00:55:02,399
That's that early generation pushes things as far as they can and then there's a slow push back

1175
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:04,703
And during that time. Because they didn't

1176
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:05,471
When

1177
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:06,495
You know cuz they didn't

1178
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:07,775
Defeat the enemy

1179
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:08,799
They are

1180
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:09,823
Treated as failure

1181
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,127
Here's another your treated as somebody who's capitulated

1182
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:15,199
Pushing things so f****** far

1183
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:17,503
You don't even notice how far they pushed it

1184
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:19,807
You make you feel like they didn't do it

1185
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:22,111
No they

1186
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,647
Eat their own during that.

1187
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,695
Then a new piece of s*** comes along

1188
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:28,255
You know you have all this stuff it's an endless cycle

1189
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:31,839
But simultaneously there is a little bit of

1190
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:34,143
Probably

1191
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:39,263
Sexism in there to pick up getting the same treatment

1192
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:43,103
And he is definitely somebody who would be that past generation

1193
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:45,151
Didn't get s*** done true

1194
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:47,711
Ron Paul isn't kidding

1195
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:52,063
Yeah I'm going to go out on a limb and say that you might

1196
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:55,903
Maybe correct the right-wing has chosen a woman as a scapegoat

1197
00:55:56,159 --> 00:56:02,303
This is unprecedented the right-wing necessarily but Alex's audience in callers have

1198
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:07,935
Clear a pretty clear

1199
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:15,359
Alex has his collar and he's like yeah

1200
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:17,919
My tapes Bohemian Grove

1201
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:19,967
Person that I want to ask

1202
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,063
Mr. post the same

1203
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:25,087
That I called

1204
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,111
And ask them

1205
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:26,879
Ann Coulter

1206
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,207
Set about

1207
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:31,743
Offend

1208
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,279
Supportive

1209
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:35,583
You know

1210
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:36,863
Quarter is as

1211
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:37,631
Having done

1212
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:38,655
Good things

1213
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:39,679
When not heating

1214
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:40,703
Bohemian Grove

1215
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:41,983
The pace in the worship

1216
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:43,519
Call Deedee mobile

1217
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:53,503
No one is denying it

1218
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:01,695
How was your day going

1219
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:20,895
Worshipping Muslim stuff

1220
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,431
Alright

1221
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,455
Weird

1222
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:25,759
80k one

1223
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:26,527
Prayer

1224
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:27,807
Needs to be in schools

1225
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:28,575
But only my

1226
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:30,367
Alright know that Muslims

1227
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:33,183
Stop know if you catch somebody worshiping that Muslim self

1228
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:38,559
Six months in jail

1229
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:40,863
Suggesting a path that Alex should have gone down

1230
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,399
Which is bringing up

1231
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:47,263
How can she support George Bush if he went to Bohemian Grove

1232
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:50,335
That would have been good I would have been good been good

1233
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,103
Because then

1234
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,127
I could convince

1235
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:54,175
Her to not support bush

1236
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:56,479
Because Alex is still holding onto like

1237
00:57:56,735 --> 00:58:00,063
The value that she holds as a far-right figure

1238
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:02,879
And you don't understand

1239
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:07,743
Be The Winning Edge in the history of all this done in a way that the audience

1240
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:09,279
Not everybody

1241
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:10,047
Appreciate

1242
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:13,119
Hey so he could get Phyllis onto his team

1243
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,399
Of this

1244
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,167
Extreme

1245
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:16,191
Only

1246
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:21,055
Ron Paul only the farthest of farthest right is is good right

1247
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:23,615
Then there could be some value in that for him

1248
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,663
And meanwhile

1249
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:29,247
Stalking was trying to tear her down

1250
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:35,135
Daughter she's one of them even like the rest of them come on you have to say

1251
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:37,695
But the things you say work

1252
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:39,487
The other thing that I want to

1253
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:41,279
Point out that I think is really funny

1254
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,303
Is that

1255
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,839
Alex is obsessed with David

1256
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:44,607
Gherkin

1257
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:46,143
Is this like

1258
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:50,751
SS gergen goes the world you know like it's

1259
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:52,799
Everytime it brings up Bohemian Grove

1260
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:53,567
It's like

1261
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,615
David gergen is talked about it

1262
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:56,383
Yeah

1263
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:58,943
I mean it was in the Washington Times

1264
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:03,551
Admittedly

1265
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:04,575
No one's denying

1266
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:09,695
Maybe they were twenty years prior to this or something

1267
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:17,887
Maybe they didn't want people to come to their phone and nudity and there aren't a lot of water

1268
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:18,655
Easy walk in

1269
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:19,679
Yeah

1270
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:20,703
Sure

1271
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:23,775
David gergen is not a onion

1272
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:25,567
Notable

1273
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:27,615
Figure now the public figure easily

1274
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,639
Bruno butt

1275
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,175
I don't know

1276
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:36,575
Are you at the Oracle at Delphi the only reason that he brings him up I realize this is that in

1277
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:37,599
Film

1278
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,879
Alex Fox

1279
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:40,671
To David gergen on the street

1280
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:42,463
And brings up Bohemian Grove

1281
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:44,767
And I was like towels

1282
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:47,327
Is gergen I'm the guy who videotaped stuff in

1283
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,607
It's knock it out and he's like well I

1284
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:49,631
Disrespect you doing

1285
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:56,031
I don't think that's cool you broke the secrecy

1286
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:57,567
Good news like this figure of like

1287
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:59,615
Monumental importance

1288
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:01,663
Pop through the cell of Susan Basel

1289
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:04,223
Bubble Bo knows he exists

1290
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:06,527
Yeah yeah Alex is not look

1291
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:12,159
A video of Alex with him so it makes sense to heighten this person's important

1292
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:14,975
Proxy

1293
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:21,375
Make sure he is the greatest then I am also the greatest pro wrestling stuff your competitor

1294
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:22,399
Supposed to

1295
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:25,727
If you beat them that means you beat

1296
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:29,311
The best or the second

1297
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,079
The bomb

1298
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,359
No it sucks

1299
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:36,479
One last clip pran to Alex's ruminating on his

1300
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:37,503
I did I did

1301
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:40,063
Mangrove

1302
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:43,903
Should have brought that up the way he talks to himself on air like at 6

1303
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,103
Motion picture

1304
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,407
Making pho

1305
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,063
Alright

1306
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:12,831
Okay

1307
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:19,487
Boggles my mind Harry Shearer is a member of the he's not he went one time

1308
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:21,535
You got it like a guest invitation

1309
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:25,119
Bikes for a day or so. You talked about this

1310
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:25,887
A bit

1311
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:28,959
Because I have all the things he does some like politics

1312
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:30,751
Like his radio shows politic

1313
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:33,823
Text Jason

1314
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,871
Called like a little show

1315
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:36,895
Or something like that

1316
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:38,175
Alright

1317
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,455
But yes we can

1318
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:41,759
He has he has some like proximity

1319
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:42,783
Cheetah politics

1320
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:44,575
Have you ever seen Teddy Bears Picnic

1321
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:46,367
I have not seen Teddy Bears Picnic

1322
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:47,391
Can't believe that

1323
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,951
It's 82 Major

1324
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:56,351
Motion Picture do you would think that because it was written almost entirely just to attack Alex Jones

1325
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:59,679
I would have some familiarity with it but unfortunately I don't

1326
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:00,959
It's

1327
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:03,775
Like I said on a day

1328
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:05,055
The guest

1329
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:06,079
Visit or whatever.

1330
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:06,847
To The Grove

1331
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:09,151
And so you decided to make a parody of

1332
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:10,175
Love

1333
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,455
Alexis video

1334
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:14,783
Just of the growth in limited release

1335
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:18,367
It grossed about $2000000 and it is a 0%

1336
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,135
Score on Rotten

1337
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:19,903
Tomatoes

1338
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:24,767
That's not great the consensus of the reviews that I read that it was but it is basically like a

1339
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:26,047
Not well made

1340
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:26,815
Christopher Guest

1341
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:32,447
Movie he has a lot of similar cast members

1342
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,215
A guest

1343
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:34,495
Some of that

1344
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,287
Serta Sensibility

1345
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:37,823
Is is still

1346
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:39,103
Built-in floaties

1347
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,639
Fred Willard

1348
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:41,663
Is Americorps

1349
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:47,551
Bob Einstein Super Dave Osborne Hellyeah

1350
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,575
The cast list

1351
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:50,623
And the only thing I saw missing from there

1352
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:52,671
Was my man Bob Balaban

1353
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:55,999
Malabar

1354
01:02:56,255 --> 01:03:00,351
I'm not sure that Alex is actually made fun of in the film since I didn't watch it but

1355
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:04,959
Plot does involve a disgruntled waiter trying to sneak footage out

1356
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:08,799
So maybe there's an Alex parody in there. It's

1357
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:11,103
They didn't make the film to Mach

1358
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,383
Alex no

1359
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:14,431
The if there's any

1360
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,455
Connection to it

1361
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,991
I think would be interesting

1362
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:18,527
If Alex was like

1363
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,575
Enough of a touchstone

1364
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:22,367
Harry Shearer to put

1365
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:23,135
That

1366
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:23,903
Wrinkle In

1367
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:28,511
The parody of Bohemian Grove that might

1368
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:29,535
Be something

1369
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:31,583
That would come up in your like

1370
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:34,655
Sort of workshopping ideas I like

1371
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:41,055
What else can we do with this idea this thing by Jon Ronson we did that whole thing

1372
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:47,455
So then that led you to Alex Jones doing the thing

1373
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:48,479
Darkseeker

1374
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:50,783
The secret rulers of the world exactly

1375
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,575
That's entirely possible

1376
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:53,855
Yeah

1377
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:55,647
So yeah I don't know I

1378
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:56,415
I don't want to watch

1379
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,183
Just movie

1380
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:58,463
But I might

1381
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:01,279
The things are you for the show

1382
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:03,583
Picnic

1383
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:04,607
What if

1384
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:07,935
What if it is just a

1385
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:09,215
I don't think

1386
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:12,031
Think so no wonder it's got a 0%

1387
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:15,871
Ya-ya-ya your waist

1388
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:16,895
To your goddamn time

1389
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:21,503
Especially if you don't have her and you don't have the Balaban guy

1390
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:22,527
I got to have the Balaban

1391
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,319
Alright I'm pulling up the

1392
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:25,855
The cast list here

1393
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:27,903
Would you believe that it is not

1394
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:29,439
Easy to find

1395
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:31,743
On the list of credits

1396
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:33,279
A Harry Shearer

1397
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:36,607
IQ plays character named Joey Levitt

1398
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:39,167
I also directed and written

1399
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,775
It's alright check this out Michael McKean

1400
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:45,055
What of course

1401
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,335
Better Call Saul

1402
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:51,455
John Michael Higgins my man told Michael he has in there

1403
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:55,039
Alan Thicke play some self

1404
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:59,391
Build blanket self that's not in order

1405
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:01,183
Okay Fred Willard

1406
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:03,999
Annabelle gurwitch

1407
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:08,351
Call famously one-time Fred Willard came into the theater that I worked at Columbia

1408
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:10,143
Orchids at Forum 8 Theaters

1409
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:11,679
And we saw him come in and like

1410
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:12,959
F****** Fred Willard

1411
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,751
The hell is going on here

1412
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,287
And no one believed me

1413
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,079
It so I decided

1414
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:20,895
But I would wait until he was coming out of the theater

1415
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:23,711
And I would at the concession stand Yelp

1416
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:25,759
And then duck

1417
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:33,695
I did that interview that is a great meeting a celebrity Buffett

1418
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:36,767
Morgue

1419
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,047
Fairchild watch

1420
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:42,655
George Wendt

1421
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:44,191
Great Chicago

1422
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:45,471
Yeah

1423
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:46,751
Kurtwood Smith

1424
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:48,031
Kurtwood Smith

1425
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:50,079
The dad from that 70 show

1426
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:55,711
Also make you cough more importantly

1427
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:59,807
Obviously

1428
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:01,599
Okay

1429
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:06,463
Dick you are maybe the most famous linebacker on the planet

1430
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:09,023
We're going to have you play waiter number three

1431
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:11,071
The guy who played Jay Peterman

1432
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:16,959
Larry Miller

1433
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:23,615
Larry Miller that's a lot of talented people

1434
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:31,295
What about to a bad person

1435
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:34,111
Maybe

1436
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,903
The secret element

1437
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:37,183
Give me a recipe

1438
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:39,999
Christopher Guest

1439
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:40,767
Or

1440
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:44,863
Bob Balaban I could be one of the three what are the three

1441
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:47,679
Maybe making fun of Alex maybe not

1442
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:52,031
Anyway we come to the end of this and it maybe not that like

1443
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:55,359
Importance of an episode of maybe not a whole lot happened but

1444
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:57,407
I think it's important that we do come

1445
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:58,431
Some

1446
01:06:58,687 --> 01:06:59,199
Clarity

1447
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:02,271
About whether or not people are going to get arrested for saying

1448
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:04,063
Ali answer

1449
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,623
If not not

1450
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:07,391
Since

1451
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:08,159
1995

1452
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,439
Probably not even

1453
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,463
Probably not even

1454
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:11,487
But

1455
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:12,255
Also

1456
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,047
Man

1457
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:15,583
Seeing Phyllis Schlafly treated

1458
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:16,863
Rough like this

1459
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:24,031
It's not ungratifying in Subway's about it it's a little it's a little bit

1460
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:28,895
A place where they should be heralded

1461
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:30,175
People be like

1462
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,967
No no no you're not

1463
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:33,503
Conservative enough for us

1464
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:35,295
It's kind of fun

1465
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:38,879
It reminds me so much of like

1466
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:41,183
Listening to that

1467
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:42,975
Took me back to the debates

1468
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:46,815
It's in 2016 when Trump just ran roughshod over all these people

1469
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:47,839
Like

1470
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:48,607
With with

1471
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:53,215
Tons of political experience being dicks for 10 20 years

1472
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:56,799
F****** Jeb Bush's a member of the political douchebag fam

1473
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:58,847
All of that s***

1474
01:07:59,103 --> 01:07:59,615
And he just

1475
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:03,967
You suck like it was that easy and everybody was like yeah they do so

1476
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:05,247
You know like

1477
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,271
Trump was the

1478
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:07,039
Mafiosos

1479
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:09,599
Of the Abby's people in two

1480
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:11,135
That's what

1481
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:12,159
They had started

1482
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:15,231
That little colonel of s*** talking Phyllis Schlafly

1483
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:16,767
Is what lettuce do Trump

1484
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:17,791
What they're like

1485
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:21,119
They're basically taking a gamble that the emperor X

1486
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,399
He has no clothes

1487

01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:54,303
The worst

1526
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:58,143
Heralding her is like a a l

1527
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:01,215
The conservative movement as introducing calls come in
