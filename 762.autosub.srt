1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,832
Knowledge vype.com

5
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,536
A little bit about

6
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:11,936
Alex Jones

7
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:16,288
My first year

8
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,080
Jordan today it is

9
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,480
I finally I've been resistant to join see bbworld

10
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:30,624
The Comedy Bang Bang

11
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,904
The idea of it

12
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:32,928
I resent

13
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,000
All of the Earwolf business model

14
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,560
And everything sort of funneling people into this

15
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,096
This is

16
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,912
The service of man you know they had the Howell

17
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,800
Just seems like you get your s*** together what is going on with all this

18
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,080
Hi this is

19
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:56,736
Hey what's up to this cup do another subscription to you by it's not surprising that these creative people

20
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,760
People are bad busy

21
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,528
NetSpend

22
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,832
The problem is they're trying to be businessmen of the first

23
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:07,232
What are you guys doing I don't know I'm sure there's information that I am not privy to and there's some sort of an explanation

24
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,304
I don't know what it is but anyway I'm deeply resentful

25
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,328
Of course

26
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,888
But I finally signed up and the reason

27
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,960
Was because I didn't realize there was a show

28
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,264
That's at 10 bolts does

29
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,336
About his character Randy snutz okay

30
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,128
He has a show called hey Randy

31
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,152
Bandits

32
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:25,920
The best

33
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,944
Okay

34
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,712
It's so good

35
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:33,088
I don't know what it is Percival Tim bolts is just amazing

36
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,904
When I first moved to Chicago

37
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,256
Every Sunday night me and my buddy Dan Sherwood go to the family tree hope

38
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,304
Houseboat accident

39
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,328
Ohio

00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:46,656
At 10 bolts and a couple of dudes there improv show

Is Brillion

43
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:53,824
So funny and this character there's just something about it this Dirtbag guy

44
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,848
It just takes it

45
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,128
It's very relatable and

46
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,664
His instincts are just so

47
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,736
Goddamn sharp the rest of the people who run the show too or just

48
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:05,344
Of course it's just very few things are like really laugh

49
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,416
Out loud kind of things they get like

50
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:11,744
Got guttural don't I know it man it's

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,120
Just the best literally my entire career trying to make you laugh and it's not easy

52
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,680
What we've done 780 of I've got

53
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:26,080
480 wisdom this number in Capitola

54
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,432
You shouldn't feel bad

55
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:33,248
That's a load number but it's

56
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,296
Compared to other flags

57
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:41,696
Anyway hey Randy grape grape

58
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,464
Amber and I

59
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,280
I really hope that they're going to make more of them

60
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,048
Because

61
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,840
There's only nine and they're all

62
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:54,240
Betasso no need to make more episodes get to work man

63
00:03:54,496 --> 00:04:00,640
Mother stuff that's a might be worthwhile on their bananas for bonanza

64
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:04,736
Everything took that behind the pay while I was I was weeping weeping uncontrolled

65
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,784
Absolute well there's more of it there

66
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,184
My bright spot is I have absolutely torn through can lose the grace

67
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,976
To King's books

68
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,095
Fantastic Can't Wrap cannot recommend them enough

69
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,143
What he does

70
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,911
Is he takes

71
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:26,239
The 100 Schools. Of Chinese philosophy between

72
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:30,079
You do 400 100 bcee somewhere around there

73
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,895
And kind of anthropomorphize is it

74
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:39,295
Into a fantasy version of China around that time. And it said of Confucianism running roughshod over everybody else

75
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,343
You know because they have all the weapon

76
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,415
In this in this situation

77
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,999
Taoism actually kind of has greater sway

78
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,303
Along with us I mean it's fantastic

79
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,583
Okay

80
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,375
Sorry I got really excited

81
00:04:54,143 --> 00:05:00,287
I thought you were going to finish your thought I was letting her know and then I got confused

82
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:06,687
You're doing great. Better

83
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,967
There is a historian

84
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:12,063
In the twentieth century for my money the greatest historian of the 20

85
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,927
He wrote

86
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,743
Buy the history of Chinese philosophy

87
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,047
And when I say V I mean like literally

88
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,351
He is the most important

89
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,399
He did it

90
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,935
He synthesized

91
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:34,335
The history of Eastern philosophy in the history of Western philosophy Hood now you got home

92
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:37,407
Anyways I've never read anybody who's I've never

00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:42,783
Met anybody or talk to anybody was also read dr. Fang Yuan and reading this this

It's amazing I get I can I can see why the you have this this excitement

98
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:59,935
Whatever you care so hard about the Warriors maybe somebody out there listening

Maybe you'll make a new friend so I'm excited but you're weird Niche interest

100
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:11,199
I would never Ariana stay I would never argue philosophy with anybody if I didn't have that book

105
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,439
I I mean anyways what I'm saying is anytime somebody says

106
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:24,767
Philosophy and a white person said that I discounted a media

107
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,815
For me that's too many schools

108
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:35,263
Well that's why they got it all School sir

109
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,103

But I decided what would we do we got a send-off 2022

118
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:08,543
You know it's even though we are in 2023

119
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,103
We're still emotionally closing up the book

120
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,663
That was 2022

121
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,063

Okay so I said hey

00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,719

129
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:45,151
Emergency broadcast maybe it does maybe it doesn't

130
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:48,223
How much money he makes at the end of it will

131
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:48,991
Determine

132
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:55,647
Whether or not it was successful right if he doesn't make a ton of money it's not for lack of trying

133
00:07:55,903 --> 00:08:02,047

Am I alone in noticing that the Red Alert theme song samples wrong impression by Natalie Imbruglia thank you so much

138
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:36,351

Barbie string portion

140
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,239
Of that Natalie Imbruglia song

141
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:46,591
It is also the theme song from Alex's endgame documentary

142
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:50,175
And the reason is because it is a sample

143
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:50,943
String

144
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:54,783

00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,975
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

184
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:40,767
I'll be better tomorrow

185
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,839
He's not really but also that was fortuitous

186
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:50,239
The name of that drop because Carissa is also the name of

187
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,543
Scandal is on again off again girlfriend

188
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:58,943
I'm just I'm just blown away here's what I needed to start 2023 Dan the idea of some

189
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,711
Someone

190
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:03,807
Standing at the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro screaming

191
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,343
Jar Jar Binks

192
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:12,255
What we've made an impact right right through the canyon

193
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:16,607
Echo Hill words loser little titty baby

194
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:24,543
I'd like to apologize in advance for this out of context. This is mostly

195
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:28,127
In case he wants to put this in a cell

196
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:30,943
Daniel Goddard

197
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,391
Snow

198
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:44,511
But you can easily see where that picture to a sub certified

199
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:48,351
Start off of the episodes Alex's

200
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,887
Emergency Saturday

201
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,167
His day off

202
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,703
He's coming in

203
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,983
So it's such a Gordon

204
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
Stuff going on

205
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,383
Are we are on the final broadcast of final emergency transmission

206
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,199
Of this insanely dangerous

207
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,479
Believe me

208
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,831
But also important year for awakening

209
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,879
2022

210
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,927
Thank you for joining us

211
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:13,951
On this

212
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,743
New Year's Eve

213
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,023
Emergency

214
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,303
Transmission

215
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:26,751
The political and cultural begin spiritual economically

216
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,543
Planets are aligning

217
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,383
Everybody from

218
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,199
Pope

219
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,479
That died

220
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,063
Barbara Walters has died

221
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,343
I want to do a

222
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:45,183
Review the giant stories in Earth changing events

223
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:48,511
What happened versus the distractionary

224
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,071
Things that are unfolding as well

225
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,607
And I want to look at

226
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,935
Globulus rollout of their climate lockdowns

227
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,239
Now being initiated how important

228
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,847
Wherever you are in the world to fight back against those and not submit to it

229
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:09,503
Not sure that the former Pope and Barbara Walters dying requires an emergency episode but yeah we all rational

230
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:15,903
Lies our actions in our own ways use the first pope to step down for several hundred years nobody knew if he was ever going to die

231
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:22,303
Why you're not you don't know he's supposed to be a loophole exactly considering the Walters was 93 in Pope Benedict Was 9

232
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:27,423
85 this seems like too very predictable and unsurprising public figure.

233
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,471
But it's interesting to hear Alex in it

234
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,007
Justin talking about the big import

235
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:31,775
News anchor

236
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,567
Planing about all the distractions

237
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:40,223
Generally speaking I completely agreed there way too many distractions in the world and particularly in the media but where we

238
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:46,623
Blue pants is that I can say with absolute certainty that at least 75 per-cent of Alex's content is a meaningless

239
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,391
Distractions

240
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,463
But he's just reporting based on a tweet or a meme or something

241
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:55,071
Almost nothing he covers means anything and more often than not he's just making

242
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
Shut up

243
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:59,167
I would challenge anyone who loves Alex's show and thinks

244
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,447
To contact means anything

245
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,519
To go back and listen to his episodes from earlier in this year

246
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:08,895
And Marvel at how many things were emergencies that mysteriously resolve themselves

247
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,687
Edward never mentioned again

248
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,271
How does business model relies on constant distraction because

249
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:18,367
If he doesn't keep the audience hyperstimulated there is a serious risk

250
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,695
But they'll start questioning some of the basic details of the stories he covers

251
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,975
Then realize that he's full of

252
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,743
Bulshit

253
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:29,631
And there aren't any climate lockdowns but that is probably important branding to look out for in the future

254
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:36,031
From the folks who were looking for a new place to put that Auntie covid lockdown energy

255
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,823
Keep the covid you got to keep the lock

256
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:38,847
Right

257
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,943
And I imagine here's the way my

258
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:49,343
Brave sort of like sees what's going to happen it's going to be 130 and Arizona are they happy

259
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:55,743
Go outside exactly if you don't go outside that you're letting the government tell

260
00:14:55,999 --> 00:15:02,143
Tell you that your skin can burn I predicted that'll be like you may be part of the rationalization of where the rubber meets the road

261
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,191
Yeah that is the problem with climate change is that

262
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:10,591
Like Barbara Walters in the Poke. And you can be like that there's going to be 140° temperatures in Arizona soon

263
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,127
Certain inevitability

264
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,199
It's a way we get

265
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,271
Sit on the distractions here we'll talk about the big story

266
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,551
Sportster what are the big

267
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,623
Chronicle this year

268
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,159
Is a dizzying

269
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
Prospect

270
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,535
What are the biggest issues of the year

271
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,351
Dude got you 1.5 billion dollars

272
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,007
Mass censorship

273
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,031
Program

274
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,615
Surveilling and suppressing

275
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,151
People on this planet

276
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,455
Bring an incredible draconian

277
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,015
Authoritarian

278
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,039
Taryn

279
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:56,927
That could be the top story of the year is the top story there that seems to take primer

280
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,231
What's the first thing you mentioned

281
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,095
I don't know I don't know if this is accurate

282
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,375
Is anybody doing

283
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,167
Do you want your baby

284
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,215
Do you know anybody honestly

285
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,495
Is anybody doing that

286
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,055
Beautiful blessing to you and I don't know

287
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:17,919
Is that could be the top story he's not saying it is he sort of spitballing

288
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:24,319
This reminded me of the lead-up to who is the most important person in the world there was a little bit

289
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,135
Doesn't go that far but he does

290
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:31,743
Is this Vuitton Story video

291
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,023
What is the time

292
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:38,143
I thought we were going to go that direction but it's it's just a little bit of a little bit of snot

293
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:38,911
Isaiah

294
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,215
There's a giant Awakening

295
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:46,079
That is cascading and exploding into bigger and bigger

296
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,127
Finale

297
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:49,919
What

298
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,991
Is that the biggest story

299
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,039
The biggest story

300
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,599
Then the last

301
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,927
12 months the back has been broken the biomedical

302
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,695
Tyranny

303
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:05,535
And that it's come out that they knowingly creating covid-19 and

304
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,071
Call Donna poison shot

305
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,215
From the injections

306
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:21,407
February 24th invading Ukraine

307
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,967
Years of the West

308
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,991
Proxy war

309
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,783
Enticing Putin

310
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,575
Text that dangerous Plunge

311
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,111
Wildin on the precipice

312
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,903
A thermonuclear war

313
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,183
I'm a ladder

314
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,231
Operations

315
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,279
Escalation

316
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,071
Chart

317
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,631
I'm not particularly into your endless

318
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:44,447
Trying to quantify with the biggest story of the year was

319
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,471
I find that stuff

320
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:49,311
Kind of be a distraction but if Alex wants to play that game

321
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,591
And by the way

322
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:57,247
The thing that I think you could say he lands on his if there's an Awakening going on as the top story

323
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:04,159
Also none of the stuff you saying is true and perhaps more importantly these are instances of stories that Alex reporter

324
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,719
Very differently at different points of the year

325
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:13,375
Covetous basically in Evergreen narrative for him wear everyday some new blog post or sub stack article

326
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,959
Conspiracies corrected vindicates in Forever

327
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:22,079
It's a fascinating improv game where he finds new ways to be proven right everyday

328
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:28,479
Forcing his audience to pretend he hadn't already been proven right yesterday new and different ways

329
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:35,135
To be proven right about different things I'm okay found the 40th Smoking Gun amazing

330
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:41,535
Nobody f****** guns to modify a story about that Invasion repeatedly over the course of the

331
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,327
Here because it kept being wrong

332
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:49,983
Before The Invasion Alex was certain that it wasn't going to happen and it most Putin was going to Annex the Don boss with his ex

333
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,031
Play Russia anyway so he had the right

334
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:58,431
Like to do that totally cool. In solid Intel that selenski was a

335
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:03,039
Putin double agent and that Russia had paid off all the Ukrainian generals who would just submit

336
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:08,671
The war would be over in a day or two that was close as the war dragged on and Alex's horse to come up

337
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,463
With rationalizations for why you wasn't

338
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:16,863
Wrong and why Putin was right to invade he bounced around to a bunch of different storylines but the most popular definitely seems to

339
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,447
The notion that Putin got suckered into invading by the West

340
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:25,823
In order to distract listeners from questioning how wrong Alex has been about this at every step

341
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:32,223
He constantly talks about a nuclear war is just right around the corner so you can heighten things to ridiculous level of be able

342
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,503
The fall back on something like

343
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,319
You want to split hairs when nukes are right around the corner

344
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,855
It's just a silly game

345
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:44,255
I'm excited for a year-in-review type experience here though you know it'll be fun to hear Alex lie about everything he's done inside the

346
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,047
This year I mean

347
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,327
It's it's

348
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,399
Kind of insane it's it's a little bit like

349
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,423
If

350
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,447
Pitchfork

351
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,007
Ran all of their album reviews

352
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,031
Right

353
00:19:56,287 --> 00:20:02,431
They just made up the album's like they did they didn't actually exist and then in their year-end list of the top 30 Oz

354
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,967
Albums of the year

355
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:07,039
They just made up 30 completely different albums

356
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:11,647
Of like anagrams of the previous ones about what is half

357
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:14,207
Or even like in addition to that you'd have like

358
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,999
An album with a reviewed harsh

359
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:22,399
Actually

360
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:27,519
We love to 200 but I didn't write that never heard of that

361
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:31,103
Severe severe things

362
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,407
Start here to reflect upon at the end of the Earth

363
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,455
The border is gone

364
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,223
That's one of them

365
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,551
Wait already that's the year were they admittedly just got rid of the Border

366
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,575
Completely

367
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,695
Finally after 45 years

368
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,487
Slipped Away

369
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,095
One way of putting a job really insane here

370
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:52,863
But

371
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,399
We're not really about

372
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,727
Focusing

373
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,543
Most of our attention on the past

374
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,079
Study the past

375
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:07,199
Cover have a lines of History intersect together bring it to where you're currently

376
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,479
But more importantly

377
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,015
Infowars is known

378
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,551
We're looking into the future

379
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,855
Oh my God

380
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,391
What is going to come

381
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,256
In the days and weeks and months and years ahead and how

382
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,536
We are not just

383
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,936
Pawns on the chessboard that don't have any will

384
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,728
We can decide to be major

385
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,496
Players

386
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,544
In the destiny of humanity

387
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,640
God's grace

388
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,456
Land for us it will simply

389
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,736
Except

390
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:46,880
We're about to find out what the secret of 2017 is my man we're going to get to it finally is it Megyn Kelly

391
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,160
It is

392
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,232
Infowars is not about looking backwards

393
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:57,632
It's about predicting the future

394
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:02,496
We have just broken a story published three years ago in the New York Times so there is that

395
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,824
Yeah there's this is this is silly

396
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:12,224
It's a fun way to look at yourself and I understand why Alex's likes her to self perception would be

397
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,248
Beavis

398
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,784
That's way more fun

399
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:21,184
We have basically this as beat the Preamble beginning of the show talking about what is

400
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,584
The top story of the year make this maybe it's that border is gone

401
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,960
Retired

402
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,008
But really what ends up taking up

403
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:37,312
The most of the beginning of the show

404
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,336
Is

405
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:41,152
Long talk about how you got to give Alex

406
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,224
We need to now look at the nuts and bolts

407
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,248
Other programs

408
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,296
They've gone from

409
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,064
Beta

410
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,624
Operational

411
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,952
After I mentioned some of what's coming up

412
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,488
After that

413
00:22:56,512 --> 00:23:00,096
And then we're going to continue on here today but please remember

414
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,144
This is a very special thing

415
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,704
It was built by God Providence

416
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,240
Inspiration

417
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,544
And by millions and millions of people

418
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,336
Spreading the word

419
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,128
And telling the truth

420
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,664
And supporting this broadcast

421
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,712
And it is revealed

422
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,480
Hated

423
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,016
By the enemies

424
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:18,784
Other people

425
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,112
Affirm

426
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,416
By the corrupt governments by the out-of-control

427
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,720
Power-hungry

428
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,048
Zaino

429
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,072
And one little pot

430
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,096
Chicago

431
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,240
The most important

432
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,264
Nexus point

433
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,544
Focal point

434
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,824
Of light

435
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,360
In the Gathering

436
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,920
What

437
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,712
Our light

438
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,736
We also

439
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,272
Stand out even stronger

440
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,832
What why they want that life

441
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,856
Snuffed out

442
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,392
Immediately

443
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,464
And that's why you have to let it burn into your brain

444
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,048
Should have

445
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:02,816
Wait

446
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,608
Chills going up

447
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,632
Spine

448
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,936
Realizing

449
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,728
How important you are

450
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,032
In just the last 48 hours

451
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:15,616
Infowars has had the largest Brute Force

452
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,384
Attack

453
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,176
In our history

454
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:21,248
It was 200 plus million yesterday morning

455
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,552
The Brute Force attacks went up to

456
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:25,856
Billion

457
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,624
Request

458
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,464
There's only eight billion people on the planet

459
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,888
Millions of computers

460
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,216
Hijack

461
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:45,568
We know what about that it's 2023 now

462
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,360
Everyone knows what about

463
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,200

00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,992
Blood Infowars

465
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:57,600

00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,624
Billion

00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,648
Finish

468
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,672
Request

469
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,024
Ascent course they weren't targeting infowars.com

470
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,096
They were targeting Infowars

471
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:08,864
Store

472
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,144
Dot-com

473
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:10,912
Those

474
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,936
Bastard

475
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,728
Infowars

476
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:16,544
Store.com

477
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,592
Is awesome

478
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:23,712
I haven't gotten into the website they're not trying to get on

479
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,016
Maximum security on it

480
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,832
They're just

481
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,600
Flooding it

482
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,648
GoDaddy

483
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,440
No matter how big

484
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,464
Servers

485
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,232
McLeod

486
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,256
Overwhelmed

487
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,304
By 2 billion

488
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,072
Request

489
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,608
We're talking

490
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,400
Millions of requests

491
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,680
Every few minutes

492
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,704
Don't you get it

493
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,472
Don't you get it

494
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:48,800
They can't handle the idea that you would

495
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,080
Give Alex money

496
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,896
You know they can't handle the idea

497
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:56,224
The people would support Alex and his bright light

498
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,624
Shining in the darkness until they do these massive attacks on the store

499
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,208
Central website take out the store

500
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,352
Against that go to the store and buy all the s***

501
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:17,472
I didn't

502
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,776
Probably but you won

503
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:23,616
I don't I have no idea why I know why anyone

504
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:27,200
Would think that the Infowars store is safe with their information

505
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,992
This year we've had

506
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,272
A million different

507
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,552
Massive Corporation

508
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,320
Compacted like

509
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:36,416
Millions of passwords and release all over the place

510
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:43,072
Why would Infowars have better security than any of those I think you judge some of that stuff

511
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:43,840
By like

512
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,400
Surrounding context

513
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,168
You know like

514
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,472
You see enforcer like this is a tight ship

515
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:58,688
This is the kind of place do you know crosses Artis dots their eyes they're on there on top of shift

516
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,736
I think about when I think Infowars

517
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,016
I think detail

518
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:07,904
And fairness I don't think I would trust them with a dummy address

519
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:14,304
Find some way to get my real address just by looking at it if I opened a completely clean

520
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:20,192
The new email address

521
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:23,008
But yeah so they have this DDOS attack

522
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:28,896
Resolved now so you can go and give Alex money will buy his s*** now

523
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,456
I don't know that he does this a lot I mean like

524
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:38,624
Maybe there was a DDOS attack of some sort I'm not sure about the two billion number that seems excessive

525
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,720
But yeah it mean he has this a bit I mean that you just as bad

526
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,024
Bad the security

527
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:49,888
Cloudflare protection or whatever

528
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,168

Of course

531
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:56,032
But one of them is something that I thought was sold out like six months

532
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,336
Think about how important

533
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,360
That is definitely

534
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,152
The enemies of freedom

535
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,176

We don't get taxpayer money ready globalist money

549
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,440
We have you supporting us

550
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,744
I am so they'll sell a coffee cup

551
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,048
50 bucks for t-shirt 400 box or ball cap

552
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:50,816
Gmod

553
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,632
Cost that you know the

554
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,424
Coffee mug didn't cost that in

555
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,704
Pizza token

556
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,776
No sign that you were supportive at a key juncture

557
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,080
I look I am

558
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:02,848
The most

559
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:07,200
Critical person of Alex in the world and of his business practices

560
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:11,040
Even I have zero problem with him selling autograph books at a markup

561
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:14,368
I have no idea why you feel the need to be defensive about this

562
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,952
Maybe it's because there's a ridiculous level of Bryson Kris

563
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,512
But he's entitled to put a price on his time

564
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:23,584
If he wants to say that it's 70 bucks for him to sign a book

565
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,864
That's his right to do so

566
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:31,264
I mean I look at I have a I have a paperback of Douglas Adams

567
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,128
The Long Dark tea-time of the soul and I have a hardcover signed edition of The Long Dark

568
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:39,456
T-top with assault I'll tell you what I think one of them is worth more money

569
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,736
Sure and if

570
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,808
They were being sold you would expect one of them to Costco

571
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,464
Incidentally back when that book came out I would sign thousands of copies and wouldn't stop talking about how difficult it was

572
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,256
Somehow they were all sold out

573
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:58,656
A limited availability thing like his dumb silver coins but I guess either they weren't sold out or there is

574
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,216
The finite number of these signed books after all

575
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:07,104
Just trying to exploit the audiences fear of missing out on the opportunity to own a piece of History by creating

576
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,408
Artificial scarcity among this s***

577
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:12,736
The sign the books and salamida a******

578
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,784
The thing about the stakes for him

579
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,368
Is that all of these sales pictures

580
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,392
Have the like

581
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,672
Depth

582
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,208

583
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:28,608
Emergency broadcast crispin's Day speech but it's

584
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,888
Leg in their beds

585
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,472
What they wish they had a signed copy

586
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,008
Beautiful

587
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,544
This is not this is not good

588
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:43,968
No it's not and Alex has this habit of undercutting some of these sales picture

589
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:47,040
Like you got to get this signed copy of the book

590
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,600
But why would you do that want to hear this

591
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,904
Where to have signed books

592
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,696
For two more weeks

593
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,768
And there will no longer be any more signed books

594
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:57,792
The great reset

595
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,328
And the world

596
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,144
Except for one limited edition

597
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:06,752
Sometime in the future

598
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,544
Consign it

599
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,920
Inside each book I don't know when I'm going to get around to that

600
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,712
I want two people requested that

601
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,760
So there will be a limited number

602
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,296
Sometime in the future

603
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,320
A few thousand copies

604
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,600

Weather

606
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:27,744
And then that's it no more signed copies of the great reset the world so if you want a signed copy

607
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,560
Your last chance

608
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:37,216
If you're thinking about buying a signed copy would like you to obviously rather have the copy with some art in it

609
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,520
Is that a hundred other folders

610
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,056
Cr3 puts in there

611
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:45,152
Yeah I feel like that's that's an anti sales pitch

612
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,464
Cool why not buy it now and also buy it later but actually the one that's more valuable to buy later

613
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,512
Paint-by-numbers kit of Hitler's dogs

614
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:05,120
You know all of his dog panting so I'm going to put one of those and I'm going to sign it Alex Jones

615
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,656
At least one of my books way that dozen

616
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,936
Valuable

617
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,472
So Alex

618
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,496
So you know

619
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,288
Eventually he's going to put some art

620
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:15,616
These books eventually that's going to happen

621
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:18,176
Yeah these projects that he doesn't get.

622
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:24,064
AngelList puppy discusses another project that he's going to get done which I'm going to say he's never going to get done

00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,440
This isn't going to work

669
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,976
Why make us

670
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,512
Subscription site

671
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,048
The problem isn't

672
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:15,424
Like man Alex doesn't put out enough contact anybody

673
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:20,032
Fill his shows boring s*** doesn't have enough content

674
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:26,432
Why is he putting out more non-conference mostly red blink it's always the good stuff will behind this pay wall decor

675
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:31,296
Yeah I mean there's no ad breaks because the whole thing is that

676
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:34,624
It's all in that the whole show is at its all one big ass

677
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,720
Write in a commercial free podcast that's behind a paywall is like

678
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:45,120
If you put commercials in the thing goes by to pay while you're an a******

679
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,168
Play some kind of subscription service

680
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:52,288
Hitmaker mistake you still going to commercials for his s*** in the stuff that's behind a paywall

681
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,360
This is this is silly

682
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:58,176
I mean look we have the

683
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,456
Constant talk of

684
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,992
You know there's going to be this

685
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:05,344
This show of all colors show that's going to be coming out

686
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,136
This is just

687
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,464
I don't know infrastructures they're great

688
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:11,488
Maybe

689
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,024
Sure doesn't sound like it

690
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,352
And this is a step backward

691
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,888
Honestly like

692
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:23,264
He used to have the prison planet TV that was the subscription service that like

693
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,312
Had a lot of video content in it

694
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:29,152
And and what-have-you this is a move back to his old model

695
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,944
That clearly wasn't

696
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,224
Like enough

697
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,504
We didn't work

698
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,784
In a way that

699
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:36,576
This

700
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,856
Excessive sales

701
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:43,232
It does it's just going to be chasing after diminishing returns even if

702
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:45,024
He follows through with it which I don't think

703
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,400
You will know I mean if you follow through with that the only other smart thing to do is wind everything else down

704
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:54,496
You know that's what you would have to do in this situation because he's not going to

705
00:35:54,752 --> 00:36:00,896
You come back but that's antithetical to the way that he presents himself as he wants to get all the information out

706
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,176
Can't wind down

707
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:04,992
To get the information out and you want to like

708
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:09,600
Have a Awakening among the masses then your shouldn't be behind a paywall

709
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:13,696
Because then you're selecting for who has access to that information

710
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,488
And that's just

711
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:18,048
I don't know what's up enough money in a lack of

712
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,584
Intelligent enough to

713
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:25,216
Yeah I feel I feel like this is bad for him from a laxative

714
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:30,336
Subtle messaging perspective and it's also bad from a financial perspective cuz no one

715
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,616
Is interested in that

716
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:34,688
It's the people who bought the founding member coins

717
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:40,832
Things are going to get free subscriptions to this anyway those are people who would have bought the subscription

718
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,232
Decides

719
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,792
And not just that but I mean everybody

720
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:53,632
Can see with the way that this is going how desperate sounding it is like

721
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:58,240
Hey if you were 1776 founding member like here's the thing about founding member stuff

722
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:01,824
If you were a founding member and then they're like and also

723
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,664
Now we're going to give founding member status all these other people up right you're like

724
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:12,576
Okay so it doesn't really mean anything does it I don't feel that special about the thing that I did that was special

725
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:17,696
The thing supposed to make me feel special you have not removed the one thing that it does

726
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:24,096
Members only jacket

727
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,144
Via the it flaps are stupid

728
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,008
Yeah yeah it does kind of is it's a little disrespectful to the people thank you

729
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:31,776
Who founded

730
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,312
Yeah I mean

731
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,080
It sucks

732
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,128
Because it is clearly like the

733
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:40,736
Last-ditch effort they have it creativity towards finding new revenue streams

734
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:46,368
You know I mean this year has seen a bit of that a man like that a recent Wars was an interesting swing

735
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:49,952
They kept they keep swinging for more money they just don't

736
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:53,280
They never knew why they were successful in the first place

737
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:58,144
So they don't know why any of their ideas aren't working now here's the ultimate irony

738
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:02,496
Is B like prisonplanet TV when I was doing that

739
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,776
Was successful

740
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:11,456
If you could have kept like a bit of homeostasis total if he hadn't been a greedy a*******

741
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,992
30 hadn't tried to like

742
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:16,832
Constantly chase money and grow this s*** to a point where

743
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:19,136
His overhead is ridiculous

744
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:21,952
He hadn't done that if you didn't

745
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:25,792
For like being a celebrity and be really rich

746
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,072
He would have been

747
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:31,424
Shockingly successful able to do all of the information base

748
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,472
Stuff that he ever wanted to do

749
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,288
Kept it there

750
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,336
I mean

751
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:42,432
I'm going to say this and I'm not going to go out I feel like

752
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,736
It's not a new story

753
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:50,624
Huber Swift Talent

754
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:53,440
I think we've got that one on lockdown

755
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:55,744
Well you know

756
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,792
Considering the sheer

757
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:04,192
Volume of stories about just this same thing we wouldn't be living through another example of

758
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,728
Express

759
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,776
Yeah

760
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,824
It's so old

761
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,408
Alex is taking a bath on

762
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:18,528
On the website and everything he's losing money

763
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,112
But I do humbly ask all the viewers and listeners to really

764
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,952
Fundraiser right now because

765
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,560
230 250,000 dollar underage each month

766
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,096
Last 6 months

767
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:34,144
Not good

768
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,960
Everything all my money's gone I have

769
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:37,984
Like

770
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,800
$50,000 in my private bank account now

771
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,592
I don't have any extra bank accounts

772
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,360
I don't have

773
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,640
Prostrate

774
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,968
There's a trust in your name

775
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,576
My children

776
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,880
I put my $200,000 to account there

777
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,928
For kids

778
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,976
But got that money

779
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:01,280
I'm telling you there's there's nothing there

780
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:04,352
Understand you be happy about was wealthy and

781
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,120
How much are stamps

782
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,656
And I'd be fine with you I get it

783
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,680
But I'm showing you

784
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,472
When I tell you that I'm on E

785
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,264
All My Children

786
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,568
Which I don't like to do but

787
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,336
All My Children

788
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,896
And before God

789
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,200
Aya put 90

790
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,224
8%

791
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,528
Of my resources other than my home

792
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,832
Into this life

793
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:26,880
And

794
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,184
That's it

795
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,464
I'm totally committed an

796
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,768
What's so frustrating is were right there

797
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:34,816
200

798
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,376
Some thousand dollars with

799
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,656
Pittsburgh is not hard

800
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,704
Each month and people just say hey

801
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,496
I really need Vitamin D3

802
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,520
How how my God

803
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:48,896
I mean look $200,000 a month or whatever in the in the underage

804
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,176
Is bad that's not good

805
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:53,760
Because I would assume that's factoring in all of the sales

806
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:54,528
I never

807
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:57,600
But he's bringing in his net

808
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:00,416
Under Siri that's what he say

809
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:07,840
Yeah that is bad I mean I do appreciate whenever he he throws in that one little detail

810
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:11,936
As though you were already arguing you know you like I'm putting 98% of myself

811
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:18,336
Accept my house if you want to sell this house

812
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:24,736
I told one of my 7000

813
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:31,136
I'm going to argue with on on that lie it's going to be me being like a ha you haven't sold your house he's absolutely

814
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:34,208
About all of this but I do like the idea that

815
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:39,072
Are you putting it on God and all his kids he put 90 per-cent of his resources

816
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:39,840
Now

817
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:45,984
Let's let's find a way that this lie works by emotional resource

818
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,848
Resources is a very specific word in my nickname

819
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:57,247
Private bank account very specific words you're using I don't believe her second is $50,000 a bank

820
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,295
Ridiculous

821
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,575
Dario

822
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:06,975
Also come on if you're at no point in time as ever but has anybody ever sworn on God and there

823
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:09,791
Children without the intent to lie about it

824
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,559
Yeah

825
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:15,935
You say the truth if it's true it's typically performative when your life

826
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:19,519
That's generally when people whip stuff like that out

827
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:20,799
So

828
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:22,847
Money

829
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,895
Give this guy money

830
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:32,063
Democrats is not the beach that they're going to side with Ronnie or not it's you

831
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:34,367
You hold Infowars

832
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,647
In the palm of your hand

833
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,927
You decide

834
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:39,487
Whether we're going to stay on here or whether or not

835
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,047
So I know

836
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,351
While you were supporting I thank you and I appreciate

837
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:50,495
I ordered some along time ago and liked it or whatever

838
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:53,823
You're too busy and well you're right about the New World Order

839
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,591
And so

840
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,663
Maybe you think informs the service purpose

841
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,479
Then the den den den den

842
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,271
I guess we will

843
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,063
Not be on the in the future

844
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,599
Because

845
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:10,463
Maybe I am maybe I've been breathing right so much now that

846
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:13,023
It's time to hang up yeah that's the problem

847
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:13,791
That's the problem

848
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:16,607
All the time

849
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,423
A million billion

850
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:24,287
You're finally getting this is going on and the blinders are coming off and I know

851
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:27,359
We're becoming more influential in the halls of

852
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:29,151
Political cultural thought

853
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:34,783
If I were a listener who tuned in for this I think I would have turned it off by now

854
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:41,183
I would conceivably be looking for a year-end type of show where there's some information being covered but it's just an excessive

855
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:47,583
Protracted Financial whining session this is just unacceptable

856
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,351
Contact

857
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:54,495
It's all good and well to beg your audience for money but at a certain point when that's all you're doing for the 1st

858
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:57,311
Half hour of your to our year-end show

859
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,335
That's too much

860
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:03,711
It's okay to have Advil help fund the message but when the message is basically just the ads

861
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:06,015
What value do you offer in audio

862
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:11,647
If I were listener I'll probably be recognizing that this is actually a very fitting

863
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,439
Gearwrench / Alex to be doing

864
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:20,095
There's nothing unique or knew about the idea of him spending way too much time complaining about his heroic Financial battle

865
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:23,167
And I will be asking myself if I ever saw that changing

866
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:28,287
His bigger conceivably a time in the future when Alex isn't going to be doing this

867
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:33,151
When he's shifted into a place where the money is fine and he can focus on actual information

868
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:38,271
Obviously if you're honest with yourself you have to recognize that until he Flames out

869
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:40,063
This is how things are going to be

870
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:45,695
He's going to be an angry passive aggressive panhandler pretending to be fighting imaginary supervillain

871
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:48,255
When you look back on his career

872
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:50,559
You have to ask yourself why he even needs money

873
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:57,215
He did his most influential work long before he had to supplement line and every major event that he's been involved in

874
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:58,239
Past that point

875
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,263
Is been a disaster

876
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:06,175
In the before time he had things like Bohemian Grove 911 Waco and being the true voice of the Tea Party

877
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:10,015
I was the real tea party with Ron Paul

878
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,551
Ron Paul Revolution

879
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,855
Well he's been Rich he's got Trump

880
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,879
Pizzagate

881
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:19,999
Defaming the head of Chobani the Sandy Hook lies and trials is divorce Jade helm

882
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:21,279
It's all been embarrassing

883
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:24,095
You really shouldn't have money I mean it is

884
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:28,447
It is unfortunate but the thing that makes the most sense to me is like

885
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:32,031
This is a Behind the Music VH1 from the 80s

886
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:36,383
You know like this is going to go back to his roots but I mean like he's

887
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,175
He's Def Leppard

888
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,455
Behind

889
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:41,759
We're going to get to the end

890
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:46,879
Sounds like what was it all for man during their meteoric rise it was all fun and games

891
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:50,207
And then it got dark

892
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:56,607
I think if you take a step back and look at like the sort of trajectory of his career UE is like a ban

893
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,631
And that had like

894
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,167
Better chops

895
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:05,567
Before they made the big time I made the big time

896
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:08,639
I don't know what their early stuff was like

897
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:15,039
Did they do the Sex on Fire song Fire their first album was like

898
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:19,135
6 years before that is pretty good as the metaphorical

899
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:25,791
Drake out like a slightly more like add a little bit of black Rebel motorcycle

900
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,583
Motorcycle club to The Strokes

901
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:29,631
And that would be their first album

902
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,399
Okay

903
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,703
That makes sense to you

904
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:36,287
Damn I Remember The Strokes may we go

905
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,079
At the Elmwood

906
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:44,479
Unescapable when I was in college did seem to be that way

907
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,247
Nonsense

908
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,039
Super long

909
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:50,111
Add s*** into a little bit of

910
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:50,879
Discussion of Alex

911
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:51,903
Family

912
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:56,767
And we get a little story about his dad was the smartest boy in Texas

913
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,839
And the story is a little different than other times you stole the pass

914
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,631
Print out flyers

915
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,911
Go to the mall put them on the

916
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,471
Windshield the cars

917
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,263
This is how we're going to win

918
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:11,871
Because I know this is the most fireflies out there we're having

919
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,151
The biggest effect

920
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:17,247
The things I talk about I know where real and I know where the globalist plan

921
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:19,295
I tried to recruit my father

922
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,343
To join the Eugenics call

923
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,879
Top of his class

924
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:24,671
High School

925
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:28,255
My grandmother thought he was being

926
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,631
Eisenhower Wizkid program

927
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:41,567
18-wheeler with a giant Ruby laser to his

928
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,335
House

929
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,103
Texas

930
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,151
Do you have the top test scores

931
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,943
That's what Eisenhower was doing

932
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,479
That was JFK

933
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:54,111
Built the laser they said that's it really

934
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:54,879
Really

935
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,159
Bunch of pieces

936
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:59,743
Pretty sure you didn't just a real cheap travel Kilmer

937
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,303
Houston

938
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,583
And looked at the laser

939
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,351
Operation

940
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:05,887
And

941
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:10,751
And he thought he was in a program for NASA was not the program for NASA

942
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:14,591
And by the time he got into college he got out of

943
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:18,431
So this isn't how Alex is told the story about his dad's recruitment in the past

944
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:25,087
Every time I've heard him tell the story before it's been that his dad was the smartest boy in Texas so dr. Irwin spirit

945
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:27,647
Tried to recruit him into the extermination price

946
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:34,559
Speer was a professor of biology and botany at ut-austin so it doesn't quite match up with this laser story

947
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:42,239
The waste of such amazing laser talent I mean it really does sound eerily similar to real genie

948
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:47,615
Write it but it is fun I mean this is how I guess if I were a liar I would try to like

949
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,383
Shift

950
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:54,783
Stuff about like my being in the gifted program

951
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:59,135
The farm system in Tripoli

952
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:05,535
I'll buy a vagary of chance I had a reading level a little bit maybe I was behavioral East

953
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:08,863
Slightly weird but in a non-disruptive way to get

954
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:15,263
Stop being recruited maybe this guy be better if we just let him learn too much

955
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:19,871
About the Knights of the Round Table instead of what worth

956
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:26,271
Cool could be a problem if we board him yeah it's but I would I would I would recontextualizing

957
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:32,671
That looks like the beginning of the globalist plot to try and bring me Envy that's one thing in those David Jones.

958
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,719
A position I would love to just

959
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:37,023
Grill him on his personal history like

960
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:43,167
Alex says you did this what did you wear you the smartest boy in Texas

961
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,703
Are you the smartest

962
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:46,495
So Alex his dad

963
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:53,151
Made a Lasik and then because the stupid the principal was was

964
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:59,551
Mean they shut they changed the trajectory of the laser to hit his house where a lot of popcorn was waiting

965
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:03,135
Bloated in Eisenhower showed up

966
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,671
Jobs

967
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:07,743
So what happened with his dad and uncle

968
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:12,607
This is on his mom's side I believe it at the Hammond Uncle Buckley's dad

969
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:14,399
Cuban press

970
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,935
Then my uncle

971
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,959
Wasn't Iran-Contra

972
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:18,495
Call me about it

973
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,031
Hydride

974
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,311
You know why you got up

975
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,407
U.s. government trafficking children out of Central America

976
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:32,063
In charge of a bunch of stuff

977
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,391
No further

978
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:38,207
Online when I tell these stories

979
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,255
They go well

980
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:42,559
Big'o

981
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:44,351
Jones is one of them

982
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:46,143
Because service family

983
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:49,215
MRNA

984
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,127
Husk

985
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,687
Ecohealth Alliance is there vice-president

986
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:01,503
Was there a medical operation

987
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,295
Expose everything

988
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:05,087
It is probably going to prison

989
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:14,815
You judge

990
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,863
But none of that even matters

991
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:19,423
You are now

992
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:21,727
Staring down the barrel of this thing

993
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:23,263
And you're going to have to decide

994
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,055
Whether you're going to speak out and fight back

995
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:25,823
And there's no

996
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,103
Better place

997
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,639
Speak out at fight back

998
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:30,431
Infowars

999
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:32,479
Infowars

1000
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:34,527
Dot-com basil

1001
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:37,087
And don't let these people win

1002
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,879
Wow pretty good

1003
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:46,815
Also your uncle if you was in charge of stuff he was he was trafficking children

1004
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:49,119
I think about his

1005
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:52,959
Personal mythology of his family the more it's like wait

1006
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:56,287
Every story you tell about your family is at

1007
00:51:56,543 --> 00:52:02,687
Morally dubious your family fought for the Confederacy

1008
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:09,087
Force for evil in this world at your uncle is involved in Iran Contra and was trafficking humans

1009
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:13,695
That used for nefarious purposes and apparently was a so-so day

1010
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:19,583
Which has its own negative unintended consequences

1011
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:23,679
If his moral compass is shaped by what he thinks are war criminals

1012
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:30,079
Punjabi by imagine this would be like well the only way I can justify my family being filled with murderers

1013
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:33,407
Child traffickers and I'd awful people is if

1014
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,199
There's an even worse

1015
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:41,599
Globalist Empire out there is no good in the universe

1016
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:47,999
0 think about the people he associated with are the longtime people who have been like in his work

1017
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:50,047
But folks like Steve pieczenik

1018
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,583
Or Larry Nichols

1019
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:53,631
These are horrible people

1020
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:54,399
Monsters

1021
00:52:54,655 --> 00:53:00,543
Absolute Heroes within the infowar and Alex's hottie and switches

1022
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:06,175
It's totally tell Alex Alexa is family terribly

1023
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:06,943
What

1024
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:08,735
You got a donut

1025
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,783
By Alex's s***

1026
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,575
You know you know

1027
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,343
You know

1028
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:16,159
It's going to wind up at the Infowars store

1029
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,183
Every allroad

1030
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:23,583
Sometimes the journey is just fun sometimes you got to sit back and enjoy the the way you get to I think that time was definitely one of

1031
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:29,983
The less predictable forgiven for thinking that that trip to the store

1032
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:31,519
Was going to wind up in a different place

1033
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,287
Yeah

1034
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,567
To look

1035
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,847
There's a high cost

1036
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,127
To the infowar

1037
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:38,175
There been a lot of soldier

1038
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,199
Tobin Lofts

1039
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:45,087
Infowars is just a focal point Barbara Walters

1040
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,367
Made major sacrifice

1041
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,647
You don't know about

1042
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:48,927
To bring you this information

1043
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,207
I'm going to leave it at that

1044
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:52,255
I'm talking about people have died

1045
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:53,791
To bring you this information

1046
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:55,071
Many bothans

1047
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:55,839
Guide

1048
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:57,631
People close to me have died

1049
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,679
To bring you this information

1050
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,727
I paid extremely heavy price

1051
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,519
Bring this information but

1052
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:05,567
Donuts because God watching

1053
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:07,103
And I know we can beat these people

1054
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,127
Children

1055
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:09,663
Are counting on us

1056
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:11,199
To do this

1057
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,991
God's watching this is a test

1058
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,527
And if you don't do

1059
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:17,087
You don't stand against this

1060
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,927
But who's that who died

1061
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:22,975
If you don't turn off your targeting computer

1062
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:24,255
And Trust the force

1063
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:27,327
Those f****** missiles are going anywhere near that.

1064
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,607
Who died

1065
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:32,447
Like to get this a turtle

1066
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:38,335
Sorry

1067
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:40,383
This is all nonsense

1068
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:42,431
We've had a bit of

1069
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:43,711
Meandering

1070
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:46,271
In the beginning of this

1071
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:48,831
This episode because of this is what Alex is doing

1072
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:50,623
2nd year

1073
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:51,647
But

1074
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:52,671
Get down a bit

1075
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:54,975
I had like we get what we were really looking

1076
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:57,279
For which is the 2023 predictions

1077
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:59,327
Yes finally

1078
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:05,727
Year you were here to tell us the future tomorrow's news today this is why you

1079
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:06,751
You show up

1080
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:09,567
I tried to write notes last night this morning

1081
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:10,847
What I predict

1082
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:11,615
Going to happen next

1083
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:14,175
Deprived

1084
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,967
So hardcore

1085
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:17,503
And

1086
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,271
It is

1087
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,367
So nightmarish

1088
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:27,743
I don't even feel Worthy

1089
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:31,071
Not one of these again

1090
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:37,983
Broadcast

1091
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:41,311
Myself in a dark room for about 6 hours

1092
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:43,871
Okay

1093
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:46,687
Flashlight on

1094
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:49,759
I really need to

1095
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:52,575
Look at all the information and then try to put

1096
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:53,599
Put the pieces together

1097
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:54,623
Look into the future

1098
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:59,231
But I've already got a really good idea the stuff they're going to pull

1099
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:01,279
Able to get into

1100
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,303
Marcy weights

1101
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,863
In the zone where

1102
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:07,167
Equations are

1103
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:09,471
Exactly what they're going to do

1104
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:13,567
And then different projects they've got and then how we can stop them

1105
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:14,847
With critical information

1106
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:21,247
I guess you're not getting those prediction

1107
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,807
Italics in a dark room

1108
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:30,207
I've got to go trip balls in a room by myself so I can see the future I got to go pretend I'm developing phone

1109
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:34,815
Photographs I'll never take right right

1110
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:41,983
Yeah I want your reaction that because it is of god.

1111
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:48,383
Worthy to kilometers

1112
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:57,343
Sometime it's also code for there's every reason why I should have something totally should I do

1113
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:01,951
There's an expectation that I would have prepared

1114
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:03,743
And I would give it to you

1115
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:04,511
But I do have

1116
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:07,327
So let me tell you about how hard I tried to get it

1117
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:08,607
And

1118
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:10,143
I'm being

1119
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:11,167
Modest

1120
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:18,079
I'm being responsible by by saying I can't cover this right now I am but a mortal vessel

1121
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:18,847
For this

1122
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:22,431
This information that is so important because it's supernatural

1123
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:28,575
If I could be Supernatural I would have been able to achieve it however it's a goal that is only a chiva bus

1124
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:34,463
Right so I'm going to go lock myself in a room but I got to do

1125
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:36,255
Soup healing

1126
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:38,559
At least we can cover them

1127
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:44,191
So I mean it's a little bit of a second place

1128
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:44,959
Consolation

1129
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:46,495
Surprise now well

1130
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:47,775
Why do you do this

1131
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:51,103
Let me move on from and now into the news

1132
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:54,175
But when I tell you that we are

1133
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,223
In your hands

1134
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,295
That's truth

1135
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,575
I'm asking you

1136
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:02,623
I think about the fact is there really

1137
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:05,183
A question of whether or not you're going to support the broadcast

1138
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:06,719
Really

1139
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:09,791
You want to give up to these people cuz that's what it is

1140
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:16,191
I guess we're not getting to the news we're going to talk more about that

1141
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:17,471
Little p****

1142
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,007
If I were on the fence

1143
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:22,079
This sales pitch is making me want to stay away from that fence

1144
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:22,847
See ya

1145
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:23,615
Yeah

1146
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:26,431
He's going to try and get you in a timeshare

1147
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:30,527
Are you into that really you're not going to give to me what what

1148
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:36,415
You're going to have God to answer to Ackley great

1149
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:39,487
So anyway we're not going to get to the news instead we're going to get

1150
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:43,839
F****** so weird this show gets weird

1151
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:46,143
Your brain is a giant

1152
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:48,191
Electrochemical transceiver

1153
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:49,727
Alright

1154
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:54,335
You can talk you can dial your brain to any channel you want right now

1155
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:55,615
My free will

1156
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:58,431
I can dial to the Satan Channel

1157
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,783
I can go into that bathroom in there

1158
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:06,623
And what DLC is available

1159
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:09,695
Seidlitz something else jump right into me in the driver seat

1160
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:13,279
Absolutely

1161
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:17,631
People's arms out of their sockets

1162
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,447
Could you get me all sorts of evil inclination

1163
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:23,263
And understanding but only had to hurt people

1164
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,639
And people like fauci

1165
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:33,759
There is a system of anti-god anti-human

1166
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:37,087
Inside that body that's running that body

1167
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:42,719
That's a biological Android with one Mission and that is to humiliate you

1168
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:45,023
Cut you off from God before they kill you

1169
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,047
Reminder

1170
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:47,327
People you disagree with

1171
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,351
Are demons

1172
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:49,887
It is not just

1173
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:51,679
A disagreement

1174
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,447
People

1175
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:53,471
Pardon the dial

1176
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:01,919
Molest children

1177
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:09,087
With a spike protein goes into the cells

1178
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,647
Generations and is passed on the children

1179
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:13,183
Causes of mutation

1180
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:15,999
They are turning people into mutants

1181
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:21,375
Now

1182
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:23,679
Don't say God didn't put

1183
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:25,727
Something interesting

1184
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:26,751
What

1185
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:29,055
What weapon formed against

1186
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:29,823
Prosper

1187
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:30,591
What

1188
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:32,639
It is electrochemical

1189
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:34,687
Shall we need

1190
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:36,991
Turn the dial to the Holy Spirit

1191
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:39,039
Broadcast

1192
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:43,135
And obviously if you been to dial the other way

1193
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:45,695
I don't want to turn the dollars.

1194
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:46,463
Too good

1195
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,231
Turn the dial

1196
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:47,999
Porter-gaud

1197
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:51,327
What but if you don't want to be cut off

1198
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:54,143
The creator of the universe forever

1199
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:55,679
And be with these things

1200
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:58,495
That Free Will and decided to be nice things

1201
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:03,103
Then you better take that dial you better turn it to God and you better

1202
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,127
Sledgehammer

1203
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:05,407
And break that.

1204
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,943
Are you can't even turn the

1205
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:11,807
And I finally got to that point the last few years

1206
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:18,975
Wow what progress are you making this progress

1207
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:21,023
You know what I was when I was little

1208
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:23,071
When I was like 9 or 10

1209
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:24,863
The pastor at our church

1210
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,655
He had me he had me hooked

1211
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,959
I thought he was I thought he was very smart

1212
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:31,007
Cuz he was really well-read and he could

1213
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:33,311
Quote all the stuff right you know do the whole thing

1214
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:36,127
And then I went to the youth group for the first time

1215
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:37,407
And the youth guy

1216
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:39,455
Was trying to do the exact same thing

1217
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,991
Because he sucked at it

1218
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:43,039
He accidentally revealed all the bulshit

1219
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:46,623
Right that feels so much like a youth group speech of like

1220
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:49,695
Listen you're not ready for the pulpit buddy

1221
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,743
You got to stay in the gym

1222
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:54,047
With a bunch of kids around you playing the guitar

1223
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:58,911
I know all your friends are telling you that hyperventilating a bunch is really cool but then

1224
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:03,263
The devil will come again

1225
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,543
So there's three point

1226
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:05,567
In that

1227
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:09,663
That clip that aren't that play together that are really weird

1228
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:11,711
One is Alex saying at the end

1229
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:12,479
That use

1230
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:15,807
It's no longer able to tap into that devil dial

1231
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:22,207
Which is contradictory to the beginning part where he said he could stare at himself in a mirror turn that off

1232
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:28,351
Heather that's contradicted by him saying that in order to turn the devil dial you need to kill people or abused children

1233
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:33,471
Exactly cuz look at yourself in the mirror

1234
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:39,871
Necessary or Alex's revealing that he has killed a bunch of people and that is why it anytime you want it

1235
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,943
You know he's already turned the devil

1236
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:47,551
Sure that might be whatever you want a walker

1237
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,319
Again

1238
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:54,463
The more he talks about how he's morally righteous the less it sounds like he understands what morality

1239
01:02:54,975 --> 01:03:01,119
Gidle that you doesn't know I don't think so either I think that Alex said that like God has a thing that helps with the mutant

1240
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:04,959
Or whatever I think he said that in order to be like

1241
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:08,031
Hey you don't answer is gokil

1242
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:11,103
Anybody who's been vaccinated you got a pillow

1243
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:17,503
It's a little bit of precarious his language

1244
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:19,039
Answer or whatever is the

1245
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:22,623
Back door that you can get to hurt

1246
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:26,975
There's a self-destruct button God put in there on his own you can just

1247
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:33,119
Hate them forever and give me money or you can talk to them and convince them to turn off their mutation

1248
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:37,727
Through the Holy Spirit

1249
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:38,751
What a great metaphor

1250
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:40,799
So we got some more talk about dial

1251
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,663
This metaphor is pretty pretty big and Alex's head today

1252
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:48,223
Ears

1253
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:51,039
Or I cannot even turn on the Satan

1254
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,903
I'm not even tried but in your dial is rope

1255
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:58,719
I gave my bet experience

1256
01:03:59,487 --> 01:03:59,999
Likes you

1257
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:02,303
I don't even think I've got this

1258
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:03,839
That's a good thing

1259
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:04,607
It's like

1260
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:06,143
Rear view mirror

1261
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:12,543
Camp Seymour

1262
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:13,567
I'm going someplace

1263
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:14,591
I'm on a path

1264
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:15,871
I'm on a trajectory

1265
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,151
I want to get in line

1266
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:18,431
With the Holy Spirit

1267
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,223
Future

1268
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:24,063
Only teleported to the next dimension

1269
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,439
Oh yeah

1270
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:32,767
Do you want that here have that

1271
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:33,791
I'm right there right now

1272
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:38,911
God right now

1273
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:40,447
Unbelievable

1274
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:43,007
God

1275
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:44,543
Come to me

1276
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,967
Dial

1277
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,575
Turn all the way to God

1278
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:00,415
The more I stand up against evil the more I go to

1279
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:01,951
The more I could turn the.

1280
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,487
And then it becomes

1281
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,255
Good thing

1282
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:05,535
Tamor I'm attack

1283
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:10,655
Vegan stronger

1284
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,447
Sure my body looks

1285
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,471
But it's just a vessel

1286
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:18,079
And is a symbol of the slaves

1287
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:26,783
But I got a lot of your interview stuff with

1288
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:36,511
Copy.

1289
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:38,047
Godby.

1290
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:40,863
What's today

1291
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:42,143
Espionner

1292
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:44,703
Imprisoned

1293
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:46,751
Okay

1294
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:49,311
Back to back

1295
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:56,479
I want to get to the rest of it today cuz it was so important Sky News out of Australia

1296
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:03,391
Weather Ronan Dean 7 minutes long it's the best of nation what we're dealing with

1297
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:04,927
And then

1298
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:09,023
First I want to hear

1299
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:13,375
AJ explains genocide plan in 5 minutes for about a year ago

1300
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:15,935
About

1301
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:17,471
And then I want to play

1302
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,103
The clip from sky

1303
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:26,687
And then I want to play

1304
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,575
This is life

1305
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:38,975
Then later I'll play clip 10 maybe you shouldn't have nut like no commercial broadcast

1306
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:41,791
If you're going to have like production meetings

1307
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:44,351
Durango supposed to

1308
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:48,959
Had a very brief conversation about this whole dryer to starting a dumb show

1309
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:50,495
Have a meeting before the shows

1310
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:52,543
Start so be something

1311
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:55,871
Is there a Marvel hero that like it's

1312
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:57,151
Stronger when you hit them

1313
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:59,199
Probably just got to be

1314
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:02,783
I don't know the characters well enough but it's got to be some super

1315
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:09,183
I think you're feeling that seems like a villain power black panthers Powers is that if you hit his suit it absorbs

1316
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:10,463
The energy

1317
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:14,047
And then he can later Channel it back cuz it seems more like a sweet thing

1318
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,071
It is a suit

1319
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:21,471
Let's not like the power that rightly the power powerful

1320
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:27,871
Travel through time who if you shoot them with lasers he absorbs the lasers and then he has a gun cable maybe something like no

1321
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,919
Alice's dad true

1322
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:31,711
He would be bad he's not good at lasers

1323
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:35,295
I mean he's good at lasers

1324
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:40,159
I just that's all I can think about when he's talking about how like all these people

1325
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:46,559
They're Dede s*** on me and it makes me stronger and God's dial

1326
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:47,583
Dial

1327
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:49,375
Ticket about Liz likes

1328
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:53,471
At the end of this speech I'm waiting for them somebody to be like okay Alex

1329
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:57,567
I don't think you can share these AA meetings edible

1330
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:02,431
That's it we like to give it to everybody but Alex Alex Jay is it okay

1331
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,455
I don't think you

1332
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:04,479
You can come back

1333
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:06,527
But maybe for the next few weeks don't you

1334
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:10,623
Bill W doesn't want to be friends anymore

1335
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:13,439
Your acquaintances

1336
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:16,511
Boy

1337
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:18,559
So Alex

1338
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:21,375
I don't know why Ted Bundy's on the mind

1339
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:22,399
Why would

1340
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,935
Hebe Danville

1341
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:28,031
There's lots of stories and it comes out in the court all the tales of

1342
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:31,871
Ted Bundy the famous serial killer that would

1343
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:35,455
Drive around is yellow Volkswagen cuz it look non-threatening

1344
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:42,367
18 year old woman coming out of the mall after work and he said hey nice suit

1345
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:44,415
Get a coffee and have dinner what's your name

1346
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:45,695
I think you're really nice

1347
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:50,559
McDonald's

1348
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:53,887
And then

1349
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:56,447
Tweenies anthropomorphize this story

1350
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:59,519
And say put these hands

1351
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:06,943
He finally got caught this one woman did run

1352
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:08,735
Is that

1353
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,015
All the rest of them

1354
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:11,295
Did what he said

1355
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:15,647
And the farmhouse in a basement and put electrical tape on them

1356
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:17,695
And tortured them and raped them for days

1357
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:19,487
They were used up

1358
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:22,303
And as soon as they weren't begging and pleading and crying and

1359
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,351
Power out of there

1360
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:27,679
As soon as their eyes went dead he go ahead and strangle

1361
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:31,263
Bloody chunks out of them

1362
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,031
You know what

1363
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:34,335
I didn't in the yellow Volkswagen

1364
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:35,359
And I eat

1365
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:36,383
Put your handcuffs on

1366
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:37,919
And

1367
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:39,967
Metaphorically

1368
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:42,015
I'm going to bite

1369
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:42,783
Take your nose off

1370
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,111
You're not

1371
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,415
Want to win

1372
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:50,463
We're not in here

1373
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:52,511
With you

1374
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:54,559
You're in here

1375
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:00,959
No metaphorically New World Order

1376
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:02,495
I'm going to pull your teeth out

1377
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:06,591
What

1378
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:08,639
And I'm going to Stomp

1379
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:10,687
Like that

1380
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:13,503
Black hurting kids

1381
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:16,319
I mean

1382
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:20,671
What did Sirius people

1383
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,719
Comebacks

1384
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:25,791
Murdered them of the truth murder

1385
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:27,071
Their credibility

1386
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:34,751
You're so close

1387
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:36,287
Choclo

1388
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,567
Getting our hands

1389
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:39,359
Around their political maps

1390
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:44,223
At Mass murdering serial killer fauci

1391
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:47,295
100 times more evil than Ted Bundy

1392
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:50,367
Look at his apps

1393
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:51,903
He loves

1394
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:52,927
Killing children

1395
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:54,975
Well I mean there's a

1396
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:56,255
Yeah this is grotesque

1397
01:10:58,303 --> 01:11:00,351
There's something that I really think about you really kids

1398
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:06,239
Insurance called Infowars you know Lake and there's this idea of like there's a war of information

1399
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:09,823
Spell violent ways of talking about like

1400
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,359
Information is

1401
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:15,967
You hear stuff like this and you take him to like the way

1402
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:16,735
Geed

1403
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:17,503
Dyke

1404
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:20,319
Does his show and conveys things until stories

1405
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:24,671
You really get the sense that he's more into the war aspect of it then the information

1406
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:28,255
Like the information was just kind of an excuse for him to

1407
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:32,607
They have these disgusting fantasies about murdering his enemies

1408
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:33,375
Like that

1409
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:36,703
You think I'm going to put my hands around your political throat

1410
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:40,031
No informational relationship with it

1411
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:43,615
Miring in disgusting fantasy

1412
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:46,431
I think that's what he really gets out of it and I think

1413
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:48,735
Mostly emotionally with the audience

1414
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:49,503
Connect to a stew

1415
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:54,879
Yeah yeah I mean it is it is kind of emblematic of that type of relationship that talks

1416
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:57,183
Toxic masculinity has to the

1417
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:58,207
Insofar as it

1418
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:58,975
Cannot

1419
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:02,303
Express itself the way it used to with you know just

1420
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:05,631
Difference and impurity

1421
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:08,191
So toxic masculinity now has to

1422
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:08,959
The tie itself

1423
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:09,727
To some sort of

1424
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:11,263
Imagine justification

1425
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:13,823
Until the war is all that was ever interesting

1426
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:17,663
It's just that after the war had to be combined with info

1427
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:19,967
F*** it we'll do the infowar too if we have

1428
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:24,575
But this isn't like the way that the information War cell

1429
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:28,671
And like our 2003 episodes next they're leaving

1430
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:31,743
It's not true finding the long periods of time

1431
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:38,143
Having a Jo fantasy about murdering fauci

1432
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:44,287
This is pretty common on his show now

1433
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:46,591
Maybe that's another effective those

1434
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:53,247
It does seem that those two should go hand-in-hand much like I don't trust them with their private information my private if you

1435
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:57,343
Based on surrounding context I would not take the supplements based on

1436
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:58,623
Hughes

1437
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:00,415
Here's what I think Behavior

1438
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:05,023
I think this guy screaming about how everyone who disagrees with me a demon

1439
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:09,375
It's probably someone who should give me something that I put into my body without asking

1440
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:12,703
Needle sx2

1441
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:16,287
Legos on yellow-bellied wants to kill five

1442
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:23,967
A miserable

1443
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:24,991
Demonic

1444
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:26,527
Madrid Hotel

1445
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:28,575
Look at that man

1446
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:31,135
If you have any discernment

1447
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:32,671
If you have any spirit

1448
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:36,255
Got in uu snow that is Diablo

1449
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:41,375
That's what I'm looking at

1450
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:50,079
That's an accomplished psychopath doing it for 45 years of gotten away with it and thinks he's God

1451
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:53,407
He looks very tired

1452
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:55,455
Open the Eyes up with the

1453
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:56,735
Satanic

1454
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:58,271
Ted Bundy

1455
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:00,063
No no no he just

1456
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:01,855
Gives you that

1457
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:04,415
Look up I am a psychotic

1458
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:05,695
Can I have killed Millions

1459
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:07,487
And I'm going to kill Millions more

1460
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:10,303
You're not going to stop me from your children of mine

1461
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:12,351
Eminem murdered I'm slowly

1462
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:16,447
I'm a snake

1463
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:19,007
You see her while we tell her

1464
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:19,775
Maui shipping

1465
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:31,551
New World Order lockdown prison City reports we back

1466
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:37,951
So this is a good clip to use as a little reminder that Alex is basically an idiot who can't even do his job anymore

1467
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:44,351
He's been the first half-hour of this show begging for money and complaining about how if you don't give him money you'll have God to answer to

1468
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:51,263
Then he spent the next half-hour yelling about completely insane nonsense about tuning your brain to God or Satan

1469
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:52,031
Frequencies

1470
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:54,591
Heaven trambley grotesque fantasies about torturing

1471
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:56,127
You killing his imaginary enemies

1472
01:14:56,639 --> 01:15:00,223
After that he throws it to reports produced by other people

1473
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:03,295
This highlights perfectly with Alex's good for

1474
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:08,159
He's a really effective conman in terms of sucking money out of people he's already convinced

1475
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:09,439
Stentor is revenue stream

1476
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:13,535
And he's better than most at improvising violence fantasies

1477
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:20,191
He doesn't have the shame that most people have which would stop them from descending into these disgusting diatribes about what they want

1478
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:22,751
Metaphorically do to their enemies

1479
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:29,407
Most people would find that embarrassing but Alex has cultivated a Persona where he gets away with pretending that

1480
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,943
It's a mark of his passion

1481
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:34,015
Neither of these things rely on any work

1482
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:40,671
No preparation is required to peel off a revised murder fantasies and Alex basically isn't working script for

1483
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:43,743
Looking at this point we could do that more or less in his sleep

1484
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:47,839
Anything to take to work is antithetical to his present a way of doing business

1485
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:52,191
That's because Alex really doesn't give a s*** about this stuff passport you can get out of

1486
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:58,079
He cares about the performance of trying and the performance of carrying so deeply but at the end of the day

1487
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:01,663
It's Crystal Clear that he would rather spend his time off are doing

1488
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:02,943
Anything else

1489
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:05,759
Other than working on making a good show

1490
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:07,295
Yeah this sucks

1491
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:08,319
Yeah

1492
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:09,599
Yeah

1493
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:10,623
Yeah

1494
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:12,415
I mean I think the

1495
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:16,255
Problem is maybe he used to care about the performance

1496
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:22,399
You know he used to care about performing to the best of his abilities maybe but now it seems like

1497
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,423
The performance itself

1498
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,959
This garbage do it is

1499
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:29,823
You know like he doesn't even let you know that it's over the top

1500
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:33,663
It's unbelievable parents

1501
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:35,711
I feel like it used to be a better actor

1502
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:37,247
Currently

1503
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:44,415
Plausible way to look at him and disagree and be like I think he probably means that

1504
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:46,463
You know I think

1505
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:49,535
But like I don't think he believes that people are.

1506
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:53,631
Rubber to the road

1507
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:57,215
I don't think that he actually believe people are possessed by

1508
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:59,007
Yeah I figured this is

1509
01:16:59,263 --> 01:16:59,775
A

1510
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:05,919
Tightening of his wanting to other and demonized his political enemies

1511
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:06,943
And people that he

1512
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:10,783
He disagrees with I mean ironically it is

1513
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:12,831
More acceptable

1514
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:16,159
To literally demonize your opponent send it is to

1515
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:16,927
Metaphorically

1516
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:17,951
Play demonize your opponent

1517
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:19,487
Yeah

1518
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,279
I mean look it's it's

1519
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:22,047
Is trash

1520
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:29,983
Yeah except for like a little funny moments like

1521
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:33,311
I'm going to do those predictions and then that baby.

1522
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:35,615
I would just say that you should

1523
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:37,407
Try you should maybe try

1524
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:40,479
I know that he is averse to that

1525
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:41,503
Bye

1526
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:49,439
You know when you're saying that like the performance is worse now I think what it comes down to is that

1527
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:51,231
Previously

1528
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:53,279
Earlier points in his career

1529
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:54,559
He didn't

1530
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:55,839
Have anything

1531
01:17:56,351 --> 01:18:02,495
Right you didn't have like an Empire he didn't he didn't have this stuff you're funnier when you ride the bus

1532
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:09,151
That old Sinbad Quotev like you're funnier when you ride the bus somebody up that way

1533
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:13,503
Not as funny private jet you're not really

1534
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:17,343
All that convincing as a populist propaganda

1535
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:20,671
It's a little bit Fendi up this kind of b*******

1536
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:23,487
Sunnyway Alex plays a bunch of

1537
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:26,047
Special reports and he comes back with

1538
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:32,959
Another 30 minutes or so in this special year in emergency broadcast

1539
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:37,055
It'll be streamed out until 4 p.m. tomorrow when we do this Sunday

1540
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:38,335
For 6 p.m.

1541
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:40,639
Then I was back again 6 to 8

1542
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:43,967
I can't stress this enough Alex has done nothing on this show

1543
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:45,759
Who's 30 minutes begging

1544
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:48,831
30 minutes of meeting was ranting about spiritual radios

1545
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:50,879
I meant 20 minutes of Special Report

1546
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:54,207
They're truly feels like there's no reason for Alex

1547
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:57,023
How to do the show at all except to try to bring in money

1548
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:59,327
A him to lash out a little bit to an audio

1549
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:06,239
Truly wild because even I kind of thought there would be more meat on these bones I saw like emergency Last Broadcast of the year

1550
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:07,519
Like at least

1551
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:08,799
Try to do something

1552
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:09,567
I mean

1553
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:15,967
To meet me what is most emblematic of what's going on here is just that that like

1554
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:21,343
If you who's going to decide whether infowar stays on air or not bro you know when he says that

1555
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,623
That's such a

1556
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:23,903
Fatalist viewpoint

1557
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,951
He does that a lot though

1558
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:27,999
What it is and it is true in a sense

1559
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:34,399
You know it is going to be whether or not the audience response only you can stop forest fires and only you can give me my

1560
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:36,703
Money

1561
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:41,823
You need to project to the idea that you are doing something to earn that money

1562
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:44,895
You know I'm he's not doing that would be good

1563
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:47,199
Yeah justify the year exist

1564
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:51,039
Why is this investment worth

1565
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:56,159
Making that's so good that's kind of more what where what I'm feeling lately is like

1566
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:59,999
He used to at least try to make the pictures

1567
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:03,071
Worth it you know like he's justifying

1568
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:09,727
The the reason that you would give him money and now it's just give me money yeah you know even though

1569
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:12,031
I was kind of thinking about that and I think

1570
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:13,824
That is

1571
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:14,848
One level of liquor

1572
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:16,384
Looking at it and I think

1573
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:18,688
That's wrong

1574
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:19,712
Sort of

1575
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:26,112
It is correct if you look at it until it's wrong sort of if you look at it from a perspective of like

1576
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:29,696
Trying to deliver information and like even if information

1577
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:30,464
Drawing

1578
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:33,280
More stories like that

1579
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:35,328
Yeah he's doing essentially nothing

1580
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:36,096
Thing to earn

1581
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:39,936
But if you look at it as like it

1582
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:42,240
It's no longer really Infowars 8

1583
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:43,520
Feelings Wars

1584
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:45,568
Sure that way then

1585
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:47,616
He is doing something

1586
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:52,224
To elicit the donation of the investment

1587
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,552
Creating bizarre emotional stimulus

1588
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:56,832
For the audience

1589
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:58,112
22 react

1590
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:00,160
You know I just watch

1591
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:02,976
Cuz I think you I think you have a really really good point

1592
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:05,280
I just watched his dark materials

1593
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:07,328
With my wife

1594
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:10,144
The largest issue with that is that

1595
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:12,704
It is emotionally manipulative

1596
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:15,520
It's not actually good or bad or anything like that

1597
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:17,824
It knows the ways to make you feel

1598
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,360
Something without having earned

1599
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:20,896
Exactly

1600
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:27,296
Yeah that's kind of something in audience finds gratifying

1601
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:33,696
About that emotional manipulation whether or not it's conscious

1602
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:38,048
Want anything you're not going to get

1603
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:40,352
From other media Outlets

1604
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:41,120
Somebody

1605
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:44,192
Screaming at you but how you buying a vitamin

1606
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:48,288
Sprout time is fighting the devil subways

1607
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:51,104
Kind of authority you can't you can't say it's not

1608
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:57,504
We wouldn't be here if there wasn't something about it yeah and I think that might be part of what is on

1609
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,272
Satisfying

1610
01:21:58,528 --> 01:22:01,856
About a lot of his present they stuff is it's just like what do you do with that

1611
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:02,880
Yeah he's just

1612
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:04,928
Making

1613
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:07,488
The audience feel things I guess

1614
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,328
Yeah what is there to talk about if what you're really doing just going

1615
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:13,376
Hey you feel like this

1616
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:15,424
Hey you feel like this

1617
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:17,984
How you feel like that

1618
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,776
It's a it's a little bit less

1619
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:21,312
Meaningful

1620
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:24,640
Freeway Alex talks about to have any gauges

1621
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:26,432
Some of this that there's others

1622
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,712
Victory going on

1623
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:31,808
And I would save this is a bad way to gauge thing

1624
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:32,576
Things right

1625
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:35,392
It's out of control

1626
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:36,416
Trouble

1627
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:37,952
Remember

1628
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:41,024
Ago

1629
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:45,120
Joe Rogan put a clip of myself on his show out

1630
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:48,192
Whenever the media was saying Bill Gates net worth

1631
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:49,472
People in studies

1632
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:53,056
Maxine gets sick

1633
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:54,592
Alex Jones is a liar

1634
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,664
Set himself show

1635
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,200
Joe Rogan show that clip

1636
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:02,016
I got more than 10 million views on his Instagram

1637
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:03,808
In 99

1638
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,112
Watch percent

1639
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:08,416
300 comments I spent hours

1640
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:09,696
Several times looking at it

1641
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:14,304
I mean

1642
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:19,936
We know you were eugenesis we know you want to kill us

1643
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:21,472
About the New World Order

1644
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,664
Last time I looked at it

1645
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:30,688
Had

1646
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,480
Something like a million,

1647
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:37,088
Andy was just all

1648
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:38,112
Exposing their water

1649
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:39,904
Snapshots

1650
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:41,184
It's now like that

1651
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:43,744
So there's your AI

1652
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,280
There's your censorship board

1653
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:46,816
There's your CIA

1654
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:48,608
There you all try to silence us

1655
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:50,656
Didn't work scum

1656
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:54,752
We kicked your ass in this room

1657
01:23:55,008 --> 01:24:01,152
Yeah you may know a lot of people play White made hundreds of billions of dollars to do it again but you just found out

1658
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:04,224
We're not as easy to ride over cuz you thought we were

1659
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:05,504
Because of

1660
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,040
Comments on a

1661
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:09,088
What am I hearing that correctly

1662
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:10,880
I mean who cares

1663
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:12,672
About these comments first of all

1664
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:14,720
Second of all

1665
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:16,512
I don't believe him

1666
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:18,816
Let's pretend he's telling the truth

1667
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:22,144
Hours reading these, the serious problem

1668
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:26,496
Do other stuff this is not a useful

1669
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:29,312
That's not a respectable way to use your time

1670
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:31,360
If you're Alex Jones

1671
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:34,432
Is it just

1672
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:41,088
Reading comments on social media

1673
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:43,904
Something here I think it's time we replaced democracy

1674
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:44,672
With

1675
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:46,464
Governance by YouTube comment

1676
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:52,864
Sure like however many like plus minus whatever it is you need is it on game of assisting

1677
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:03,616
But I do like these ways that he gauges things like that the past your head

1678
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:07,968
Randomly coming up with numbers about how effective is a b

1679
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:10,784
Eighty-five 90% Buffet

1680
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:12,064
And now we have

1681
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:18,464
Skimming through comments on a social media post

1682
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:21,280
For me is a condom 99.9 percent effective

1683
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:27,680
We're going to get to these future prediction

1684
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:30,752
So let's think about that

1685
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:37,920
And I'm not

1686
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,248
Popping out here

1687
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:43,040
And I'm not

1688
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,184
Spencer

1689
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:50,720
Cartoon in Monday

1690
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:55,328
Napa tune in tomorrow

1691
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:57,376
I'm going to have to call my wife

1692
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:03,264
My office

1693
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,104
Computer with a pad paper

1694
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:11,456
And I really need to predict what's going to happen next year if we all stand up

1695
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:13,760
Weather for probabilities possibilities are

1696
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:17,856
Honey I'm not coming home all right I got to lock myself in my office to see the future

1697
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:21,952
Okay in my other jobs

1698
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:24,000
You know when I was doing another job

1699
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:25,792
Sure me going like I listen

1700
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:28,608
You know what you're right I got a buckle down

1701
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:30,144
I'm going to handle that

1702
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:35,264
I don't want to make you wait till tomorrow so I'm going to work all night for it I'll get it to you tomorrow

1703
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:41,152
Because I'm not on air

1704
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:45,248
Well

1705
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:46,272
I mean look

1706
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:47,040
Debatable

1707
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:48,320
Debatable

1708
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:50,368
A year predictions

1709
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:52,160
Episode Shore

1710
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:55,488
But to be on the 31st of December or January 1st

1711
01:26:55,744 --> 01:27:01,888
It's appropriate for either extra now what you were doing an emergency December 31st episode in you

1712
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:08,288
Emergency bringing up predictions for the future it would be in there but no

1713
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,336
He's going to he's going to tell his wife

1714
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:11,360
He ain't coming home

1715
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:13,920
But actually a code

1716
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:17,248
Another plant

1717
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:19,808
You know I'm going to do something even better

1718
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:22,368
Sure what's that

1719
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:24,672
I'm going to take off

1720
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:29,536
I'm going to check

1721
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:31,584
I don't know if your 5 days or what

1722
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:33,888
And I am going to go to the country

1723
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:37,728
I'm going to go to the mouth

1724
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:40,032
Nothing makes you think clearly

1725
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,592
I can pop them out and then

1726
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:46,176
Jar Jar Binks

1727
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:47,456
Hyzaar

1728
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:49,248
Want to go to the wilderness

1729
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:53,600
And

1730
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:54,624
Like on Sean

1731
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:57,952
I'm going to come back and lay out with

1732
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:58,720
Next year

1733
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:04,352
Oh my God

1734
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:06,912
Really get in that zone

1735
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:08,192
All the pieces come

1736
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:14,080
Sometimes when you're taking a jogger

1737
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:17,408
Really immerse my

1738
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:18,432
Myself by myself

1739
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:20,736
By myself

1740
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,528
In the woods

1741
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,464
And then I'm going to come back

1742
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,816
And I'm going to tell you what I believe they're about to pull Maxton I was stopping

1743
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:37,376
Yeah man I got to go to the woods

1744
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:38,656
OK Google

1745
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:44,800
To see the future now I'm trying to work on I'm trying to work on the conversion here because I know about inflation

1746
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:45,568
Button

1747
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:48,384
So got Thomas at underneath that tree for like

1748
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:54,784
Decades right he said under there for a long long time well could be one day could be 5 days but he was coming up with the

1749
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:57,088
Life philosophy that could last for attorney

1750
01:28:58,368 --> 01:28:59,136
So

1751
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:01,696
Just picking out a Year's predictions WhatsApp

1752
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:02,464
At like

1753
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:05,280
Depends on

1754
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:06,816
Algood the air is

1755
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:08,352
Good points on

1756
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:11,168
How alone he is

1757
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:14,240
Distracted by a squirrel

1758
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:20,896
I do love this escalation though I am not worthy to deliver

1759
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:24,992
River this information

1760
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:27,040
I'mma tell my wife I'm not coming home

1761
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:33,440
I'm going to lock myself in a dark room 6 hours

1762
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:36,512
Who knows how long I'm going to be there

1763
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:42,912
And I'll come back when I'm good and ready and I've seen the future okay

1764
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:46,752
There similarities

1765
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:53,152
God

1766
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:56,480
So we are recording this

1767
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:58,528
On Sunday

1768
01:29:58,784 --> 01:29:59,808
And

1769
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:02,624
It's actually when Alex's show is on

1770
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:05,696
Until I have it pulled up here on mute

1771
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:12,352
And it's unfortunately in a commercial so I don't know

1772
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:17,216
So I will give an update as soon as we get out of it commercial break 22c

1773
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:22,336
Very excited that we are now currently watching

1774
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:26,944
Or I am cuz you're on the other side of the screen but there's a CBD commercial

1775
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:31,040
Alex's slabbed life

1776
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,600
Yeah I mean it's cool now

1777
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:36,672
Alex's a Acela

1778
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:41,792
It was an interesting thing I was thinking about about how

1779
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:44,864
You're all he has these things that are so important

1780
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:51,776
They Don't Really follow along with who his sponsors are

1781
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:53,568
A particular type

1782
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:54,336
You know

1783
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:55,360
I really that

1784
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:59,456
That's not his style I never heard him talk about CBD

1785
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:00,224
Now it's

1786
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:01,248
Super important

1787
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:04,320
It's very cording to his commercials

1788
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:06,880
I don't hear him talk about gold that much anymore

1789
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:08,416
Which is interesting

1790
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:09,184
Here's what I

1791
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:15,072
What I'm confused about supplemental I never heard about how important like X2 or iodine was

1792
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:17,888
It is strange how those things became very important once he sold

1793
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:21,728
That is weird in the commercial of Alex in his tank

1794
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:28,128
Yelling at people trying to cross the border good trait this is this is weird to have on a Butte

1795
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:30,432
Visual

1796
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:35,552
Popping out the top of a tag yellow going to pull Hornet immigrants

1797
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:36,576
Who

1798
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:38,112
Dark

1799
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:39,136
It makes me

1800
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:42,208
Despair of a future

1801
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:45,280
Because when I was you know when we were growing up

1802
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:51,936
You have those dare commercials where it's like if you smoke weed one time you're probably going to kill your little sister

1803
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:58,080
You know like you're going to die brains going to be a Friday again version of cannabinoids can be sold

1804
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:00,128
On the f****** corner street

1805
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,688
Everybody whose old used to be like

1806
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:07,808
If you smoke weed you got to go to jail for the rest of your life they're popping gummies left and right

1807
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:10,880
Edit no point in time as any to have anybody going like well

1808
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:12,416
Here's what we're not going to do

1809
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:13,952
This all over again

1810
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:16,000
Let's just stop this let's get rid of this

1811
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:17,536
Criminalizing drug s***

1812
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:21,120
We got to figure this been there before so many times

1813
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:22,400
It's very unfortunate

1814
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:24,960
I'm sorry I got distracted cuz Alex's attic

1815
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:31,360
No he's not in the creek what's the point exactly

1816
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:37,504
Alright we're coming back from break back from break what do you think do you think it's going to be out

1817
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:44,672
I don't know if it's going to be a wee in the third hour and weed the fourth time does the whole show on Sundays himself cuz it's only

1818
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:47,232
Play two hours so there's no I guest host

1819
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:53,888
Here's the thing I could see him being there because he talks a lot of s*** but I can also see him being gone because all it work

1820
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:55,168
Requires him to leave

1821
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:59,776
Yeah and not working is something he loved prefers the latter to the former

1822
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:03,616
Is it going to be Owen is it going to be Harrison

1823
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:06,176
Maybe going to be out

1824
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:13,088
It's Alex

1825
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:21,024
This is says it's life but it could be a rebroadcast of some sort but yeah it looks like Alex

1826
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:27,424
Didn't go to the woods

1827
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:28,192
In the future

1828
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:29,728
In the past

1829
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:30,496
I mean

1830
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:32,800
Predicted 9/11

1831
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:34,336
I mean

1832
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:36,128
And that was from a dream okay

1833
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:39,968
In July of 2001

1834
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,784
And it doesn't have shelves until September 11th saying

1835
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:46,368
Blow up the World Trade Center

1836
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:48,160
Breeze's a pretext for domestic

1837
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:48,928
Control

1838
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:50,464
Bring under control system

1839
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:51,744
Then in the future

1840
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:52,768
They're going to use that

1841
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:54,304
Apparatus

1842
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:56,096
Against the American people

1843
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:57,888
Patriots

1844
01:33:58,656 --> 01:33:59,168
And

1845
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:00,704
People said how did you do that

1846
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,288
I got the zone

1847
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:06,592
And

1848
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:08,384
It's almost like

1849
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:10,176
Close Encounters of the Third Kind

1850
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:13,248
Allegory

1851
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:15,552
Transmission

1852
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:17,088
Building the mountain

1853
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:19,136
The mountain

1854
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:25,536
Transmission outside

1855
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:26,560
Composition

1856
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:27,584
Come here meet with us

1857
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:33,216
And that's really the allegory here

1858
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:34,240
Is that

1859
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:38,592
I need to

1860
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:42,432
Get in that zone because

1861
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:46,272
That would be understanding

1862
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:50,368
Thoughts of what they were going to do

1863
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:52,672
And

1864
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:54,976
I didn't have dreams of the burning building

1865
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:58,560
And it was

1866
01:34:58,816 --> 01:34:59,328
T

1867
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:01,376
Signpost

1868
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:02,912
Of where we're going

1869
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:04,704
It was a lot of

1870
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:05,984
Interdimensional

1871
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:07,520
Power going into the future because

1872
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:11,104
Continuum information

1873
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:13,664
Possible Futures are there are actions to Stone

1874
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:19,040
Don't do that

1875
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:20,576
Zacian back

1876
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:22,112
Nope

1877
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:26,464
A signature in the future

1878
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:27,488
In the past

1879
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:33,888
Interdimensional sonar

1880
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:39,264
Why

1881
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:41,824
There's like a waterfall

1882
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:48,992
I don't know I like some sort of new age you nonsense and every now and again they're going to talk about the time-space

1883
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:51,808
Continuum and all this stuff and like these possible futures

1884
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:52,576
Whatever

1885
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:53,856
I'm going to leave that alone

1886
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:58,720
In terms of judging that. I will Judge Alex on this front that is

1887
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:03,840
He doesn't know how to read a word on the page there is that I'm not going to trust him to interpret

1888
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:04,608
Signs

1889
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:09,728
From possible futures of the space-time continuum

1890
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:12,032
You do I do I do appreciate

1891
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:14,848
Celebrating talents that are not you know like

1892
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:21,248
Some people can't read but they're very good at visual art I recognize that that's possible however if you are talkin semiotic

1893
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:22,528
Learn how to read

1894
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:28,928
Even like interpret Concepts or any any of that kind of stuff

1895
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:35,328
Rapport at that skill-set so I would imagine he would get a message from the aliens and he's completely with

1896
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:37,376
If the game of telephone trying to explain

1897
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:40,960
Do us who got it was well I mean I basically

1898
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:47,360
If what I heard is correct about his explanation of the allegory of Close Encounters of the Third Kind I do not trust

1899
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:48,384
Anything he says about anything

1900
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:49,152
No

1901
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:54,528
I would imagine. Tell him to shut the f****** and that he's telling us

1902
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:58,368
Movie different message

1903
01:36:58,624 --> 01:36:59,904
Shaped like me

1904
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:01,184
So Alex

1905
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:06,304
You know a lot of his reporting is based on deep sources that people have died to bring to him

1906
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:12,704
Technically not true but true definitely not true most of it is actually memes and dumb stuff that he saw on social media that he does

1907
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,008
Don't know anything about there's that like this

1908
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:16,800
Keanu Reeves

1909
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:26,016
But he even reached out a few times through his producer

1910
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:28,576
Assistant

1911
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:31,392
Films they ordered more

1912
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:35,232
Because it's

1913
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:40,352
But I got to tell you this is a really creepy

1914
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:41,376
Keanu Reeves

1915
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:44,960
Emma movie

1916
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:47,008
I want to play this because

1917
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:49,824
Short

1918
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:51,616
I'm wondering what he said ask her

1919
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:54,688
But he says It's amazing And really cool

1920
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:58,784
Little girl at a director's house he was at

1921
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:02,112
Said I don't care if things are reality I don't

1922
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:03,136
Arabs are real

1923
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:05,440
That's the whole thing about the Matrix

1924
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:12,096
Manipulate a spiritually to make false

1925
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:14,400
That's how they believe that short shark

1926
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:15,936
Defraud Freewill

1927
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:23,360
Literal power light

1928
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:25,408
You know people say stupid

1929
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:31,808
Cuz I don't actually know and he's really smart talk to most people do people say he's stupid

1930
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:36,416
This is a very dangerous cliff

1931
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:39,232
Because they're a child

1932
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:42,304
Philosopher

1933
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:44,864
You want to be in The Matrix you decide you want to be in the front

1934
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:47,680
But children can't differentiate that's why they

1935
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:49,472
Have sex

1936
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:55,872
That's the only reason

1937
01:38:56,384 --> 01:39:00,480
Statistically it's good to protect them until they're able to make those decisions

1938
01:39:00,736 --> 01:39:06,880
I think that people they don't think they can of Reeves a stupid but a lot of his characters were stupid

1939
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:07,904
He was younger

1940
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:12,000
Play the Good stupid person like Bill and Ted

1941
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:13,536
I feel like most people can wreck

1942
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:14,304
Nize that

1943
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:16,096
When you're in a movie

1944
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:17,376
Right you are

1945
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:23,776
Pretending to be a different kind of Typecast in a lot of that with lutein

1946
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:26,080
Impression can linger in people's mind

1947
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:29,664
Particularly in the last like 10 years 15 years

1948
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:31,456
20 years I think

1949
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:32,224
People have taken

1950
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:34,784
Quite a different view of Keanu Aziz

1951
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:37,088
Become an adult

1952
01:39:37,344 --> 01:39:39,136
But I don't know I don't think that Alex

1953
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:41,440
Maybe they talked in passing

1954
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:47,328
Like during waking light outside during A Scanner Darkly

1955
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:53,728
The playing this up a little batteries correct

1956
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:56,800
To about the plot of The Matrix

1957
01:39:58,336 --> 01:40:02,176
People into making false choices

1958
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:03,968
We needed better eggs

1959
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:08,320
Listen when the batteries on your controller wireless Xbox

1960
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:11,392
Controller way-back-when sure when the batteries go out you get desperate

1961
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:12,160
I get it

1962
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:14,464
Now I would enslave an entire race of people

1963
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:17,280
But they realized they weren't nice to them either so you got

1964
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:21,376
There is one way that ilex is kind of correct

1965
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:23,424
Inasmuch as

1966
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:25,472
V-very select

1967
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:26,752
People

1968
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:28,544
Out of The Matrix

1969
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:30,080
The architect

1970
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:33,664
And the machines are trying to get them to play out

1971
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:39,040
A false choice in order to reboot that cycle

1972
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:39,808
Still want their battery

1973
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:46,208
Right that is close to it Alex is talking about accepting it's only a very select people

1974
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:47,744
The rest of the people I don't give a s*** what

1975
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,072
Choices they make within the Matrix

1976
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:52,096
Importantly

1977
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:53,376
It is an allegory

1978
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:54,400
Not a truce

1979
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:55,168
Now

1980
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:57,728
Yes about Alex's found

1981
01:40:57,984 --> 01:40:59,008
Brianna Reeves

1982
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:00,800
Terrifying

1983
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:01,824
Oh no

1984
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:05,152
I mean if it's dangerous than

1985
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:07,456
Terrify gripes probably here

1986
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:10,016
Maybe I'll try to get ahold of Keanu Reeves

1987
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:12,320
Good luck

1988
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:14,112
Please do please track it

1989
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:14,880
Chaotic

1990
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:16,416
The club

1991
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:18,208
Cuz I don't want

1992
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:18,976
You said

1993
01:41:19,232 --> 01:41:21,536
I don't know the context of it but this is

1994
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:23,072
Creepy as hell

1995
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,960
I don't I don't know I was having dinner with friends house

1996
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:29,728
Director

1997
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:31,008
And he had some

1998
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:32,288
Kids nurses

1999
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:35,616
Like a thirteen-year-old a fifteen-year-old seventeen-year-old

2000
01:41:37,408 --> 01:41:38,176
Is a parable

2001
01:41:38,432 --> 01:41:40,224
Matrix

2002
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:43,552
Until the directors like moment you just tell them it's about

2003
01:41:44,576 --> 01:41:46,880
So I start to say well there's this guy recent

2004
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:50,976
I kind of virtual world and he finds out that there's a real world and

2005
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:56,352
He's really questioning what's real and not real and he really wants to know what's real

2006
01:41:57,376 --> 01:41:57,888
And

2007
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:59,680
The young girl was like

2008
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:00,960
Why

2009
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:03,264
What do you mean she was like

2010
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:04,544
Who cares if it's real

2011
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:06,336
What you doing

2012
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:08,128
You don't

2013
01:42:09,408 --> 01:42:10,176
Care of its real

2014
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:11,968
Just like

2015
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:13,248
No

2016
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:15,296
Awesome

2017
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:16,576
That's awesome

2018
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:19,648
I mean it's awesome I mean it's awesome

2019
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:26,048
Did you cut

2020
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:28,096
Play that again

2021
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:29,120
Play the club

2022
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,424
Again here in just a moment

2023
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:33,728
Where junkyard

2024
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:37,312
I don't think Keanu Reeves

2025
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:38,592
Send it.

2026
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:40,384
That's awesome that she doesn't like reality

2027
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:43,200
I think he said

2028
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:46,016
Something about a film or something he's doing is awesome

2029
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:50,368
That's another deception affect my gut tells me

2030
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:52,416
Knowing Keanu Reeves

2031
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:53,952
That

2032
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:55,744
I don't like

2033
01:42:57,024 --> 01:42:58,560
Something Alex could do

2034
01:42:58,816 --> 01:43:02,656
He can take two minutes to figure out where the clip he's playing came from

2035
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:09,312
He's just playing a little snippet of a clip that was spreading on social media but if you really cared at all and wanted to present his

2036
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:11,104
Audience with any real information

2037
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:13,920
He could have taken me literally 2 minutes

2038
01:43:14,176 --> 01:43:16,736
It took me to find the full interview that this is from

2039
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:20,832
This is from an interview that Keanu and Carrie-Anne Moss dude with the verge

2040
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:27,232
Virginia Vance of the release of the 4th Matrix movie year old interview that Alex only has any awareness of

2041
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:30,048
Because one of his underlings found it on social media

2042
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:35,168
And now he's blindly playing it and wrestling with what the context for this could possibly be

2043
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:36,192
What does he care

2044
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:37,216
Context

2045
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:38,496
Easily accessible

2046
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:43,872
It's right there for him to find he doesn't need to call Keanu and find out what he said

2047
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:46,688
Just watch the f****** 18 minute interview

2048
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:48,480
How to repair it did you

2049
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:53,600
Did you call Kiana to get this information I didn't I just found the interview with with what power

2050
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:54,880
Google

2051
01:43:57,184 --> 01:43:58,208
It is a jump cut

2052
01:43:58,720 --> 01:43:59,232
But

2053
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:04,608
It's also more or less in context

2054
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:07,680
Yeah I feel like it's the first time

2055
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,496
In a long time that

2056
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:12,800
But the real world is almost a

2057
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:14,592
Head of our science fiction

2058
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:16,128
I mean the whole idea

2059
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:17,664
Trying to pursue

2060
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:18,944
When can we make it

2061
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:20,992
Photo-real when can we fool

2062
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:23,552
I mean all the deepfake fitting you know

2063
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:25,856
Technologies that are happening

2064
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:28,416
Wow

2065
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:33,792
No no baby

2066
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:35,328
Almost

2067
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:38,144
You know it's like War

2068
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:39,936
It's the why

2069
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:41,216
Right we can't we have

2070
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:41,984
To keep

2071
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:47,616
Species has to keep creating a species is like oh I can do that let's keep going to do that

2072
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:49,408
No one can predict

2073
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:50,176
The future

2074
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:54,016
I don't I don't know I was having dinner with friends

2075
01:44:54,784 --> 01:44:55,296
Director

2076
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:56,832
And he had

2077
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:57,856
Kids

2078
01:44:58,624 --> 01:45:01,440
Like a thirteen-year-old a fifteen-year-old seventeen-year-old

2079
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:05,536
The two haven't seen the film the major

2080
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:06,304
Tricks

2081
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:09,888
Until the directors like but why don't you just tell them what it's about

2082
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:13,216
So I start to say well there's this guy recent

2083
01:45:13,728 --> 01:45:17,312
I kind of virtual world and he finds out that there's a real world and

2084
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:22,688
He's really questioning what's real and not real and he really wants to know what's real

2085
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:24,224
And

2086
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:26,016
The young girl was like

2087
01:45:26,784 --> 01:45:27,296
Why

2088
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:29,088
What do you mean

2089
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:30,880
She was like who cares if it's real

2090
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:32,928
What you doing

2091
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:34,464
You don't

2092
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:36,768
Care of its real

2093
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:38,304
Just like

2094
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:39,840
No

2095
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:42,144
And I Wild

2096
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:43,936
Awesome

2097
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:45,216
You think it's awesome

2098
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:46,240
I mean it

2099
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:47,264
Awesome

2100
01:45:49,312 --> 01:45:50,592
This idea of that

2101
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:54,176
You know so in a way what you and I are kind of

2102
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:56,736
Speaking about his car like a legacy

2103
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:57,760
Feeling

2104
01:45:58,784 --> 01:45:59,808
We're almost like

2105
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:01,600
Oh you're older versions

2106
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:03,648
Let It Go

2107
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:07,488
I know I'm the mom at the kitchen table like talking about

2108
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:08,768
The possibility of like

2109
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:10,304
A virtual world

2110
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:11,840
For my kids and I'm crying

2111
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:13,120
You know

2112
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:14,400
That's how it feels

2113
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:15,168
For me

2114
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:16,192
But now I just

2115
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:17,216
I know

2116
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:19,776
Kind of like sitting around the table and

2117
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:27,712
You'll be able to sit around a table and talking

2118
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:37,440
Which is one of the issues that were being

2119
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:39,488
Yeah confronted by very

2120
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:46,656
He's a really interesting interview in the jumping-off point for a lot of this is the creation of the Matrix Game

2121
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:50,752
Which utilize the Unreal Engine to take assets from the actual movie

2122
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:56,384
As well as digital Recreations of the actors in the film to create very realistic Avatar

2123
01:46:57,152 --> 01:46:59,712
This prompts the conversation about the implications of being able

2124
01:46:59,968 --> 01:47:01,760
How to create virtual versions of actor

2125
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:05,600
Will they even need the people to make movies in the future

2126
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:10,976
It touches on like Carrie Fisher being in Star Wars posthumously among other points

2127
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:17,632
County was saying that this perspective that the young girl was bringing up was awesome but it wasn't like in the really great definition

2128
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:21,472
Turn of awesome it was pretty clear demented in the inspiring all

2129
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:25,568
It was even does this hand gesture where is it

2130
01:47:25,824 --> 01:47:28,640
Anyway this is an indication of Alex's work process

2131
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:34,016
He doesn't literally no preparation for the show because he doesn't give a s*** about the quality of the product he's make

2132
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:38,368
He knows that the audience is captured and they don't require much of him so he's just

2133
01:47:38,624 --> 01:47:41,952
Freestyling this b******* out while pretending to be friends with Keanu

2134
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:43,488
I'm a good day at work

2135
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:47,584
Yeah whatever I found this dumb clip and now I'm going to

2136
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:51,680
Make it suspicious but there's a cut in it but then not do any

2137
01:47:51,936 --> 01:47:52,704
At all

2138
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:53,728
No

2139
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:57,056
Curiosity based investigation 2

2140
01:47:57,312 --> 01:47:58,336
What was going on here

2141
01:47:58,592 --> 01:48:00,384
Yeah if I was going to guess I'd be like

2142
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:03,456
Oh so somebody found that clip and Alex was like

2143
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:06,016
I know Keanu I'm going to talk about that

2144
01:48:06,528 --> 01:48:12,672
Or I was plausibly implausibly able to claim I know his because we were in Scanner Darkly

2145
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:14,464
Theoretically together

2146
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:18,048
Anyway Alex didn't go find the clip at all

2147
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:20,864
But he's decided he's going to make some conclusions about it

2148
01:48:21,632 --> 01:48:24,960
This is what the deceivers do you saw this place that take

2149
01:48:25,216 --> 01:48:27,008
It's always got to get ahold of Keanu and find out the truth

2150
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:31,616
But but the issue there is that's what the left does they deceive

2151
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:32,896
How is this

2152
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:36,224
Something Keanu

2153
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:37,504
He really said it

2154
01:48:38,016 --> 01:48:39,808
Let's let's make him say what we want

2155
01:48:40,064 --> 01:48:41,344
What's get rid of his free will

2156
01:48:42,624 --> 01:48:43,392
Show his identity

2157
01:48:43,904 --> 01:48:45,184
And then misrepresent

2158
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:47,488
What he really sad and let's do it

2159
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:50,560
Video

2160
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:54,912
In front

2161
01:48:56,192 --> 01:48:56,960
Of your face

2162
01:48:57,216 --> 01:48:58,496
This is really sad

2163
01:48:58,752 --> 01:49:01,056
One of the reasons it's really sad is that

2164
01:49:01,312 --> 01:49:04,384
If Alex knew anything about where this clip came from

2165
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:07,200
He can make this so much more of a meaningful conversation

2166
01:49:07,712 --> 01:49:13,856
Because ironically the issue peoples images being made to say things is exactly what a lot of this

2167
01:49:14,112 --> 01:49:15,136
This interview is about

2168
01:49:15,392 --> 01:49:21,536
H&K Auto in karianne wrestling with a technological advancements in the house that impact the Dynamics of crew

2169
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:22,304
Creation

2170
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:28,704
Their conversation is way more insightful and interesting

2171
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:29,728
Some of their comments

2172
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:36,128
End of this presentation and that would elevate it past the point of just being an idiot blindly responding to a clip someone else

2173
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:42,528
Found on Twitter and he just decided all I want to talk about this today though the left edited this boom boom boom boom boom

2174
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:43,552
Call the left

2175
01:49:44,064 --> 01:49:50,208
Well I forgot that we have done that one man. This is how they deceive

2176
01:49:50,464 --> 01:49:51,488
The left is trying

2177
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:55,840
To take Keanu from us alright figure of note

2178
01:49:56,096 --> 01:49:56,864
For the past

2179
01:49:57,120 --> 01:50:03,264
However many years and now he's on the left saying that stuff is awesome

2180
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:08,640
So that their left doesn't want it because he is an FBI

2181
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:15,552
Anyway cuz he was a great college quarterback so they do like it

2182
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:18,368
This is all very stupid and if Alex today

2183
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:22,208
Grain of work tiny little bit of Google

2184
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:26,304
How do you see a clip that has a jump cut in it and you're like just Google

2185
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:28,608
Where is this from what is this actually

2186
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:34,496
Before you decide to get in front of your billions and billions of listeners

2187
01:50:35,008 --> 01:50:41,152
It's just pathetic time would I write a joke or even a premise I Google the premise just to make

2188
01:50:41,408 --> 01:50:43,712
Picture that somebody hasn't already written a better joke

2189
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:50,880
I don't know I don't know I don't know

2190
01:50:51,136 --> 01:50:51,648
Okay let's

2191
01:50:51,904 --> 01:50:56,256
Let's let's hit some of the news here is that news clip 9 because

2192
01:50:57,024 --> 01:50:57,792
Go to Twitter

2193
01:50:58,304 --> 01:50:59,328
And you

2194
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:07,008
Vicious mockery

2195
01:51:07,264 --> 01:51:08,032
Stop

2196
01:51:09,056 --> 01:51:09,568
And it's

2197
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:11,104
Titled

2198
01:51:11,872 --> 01:51:13,664
Watch a Cell B

2199
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:14,944
Until another cell

2200
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:17,760
And it's under an electron microscope

2201
01:51:19,296 --> 01:51:21,088
And shows another cell go over

2202
01:51:22,112 --> 01:51:23,392
Some enzymes

2203
01:51:25,184 --> 01:51:26,976
Membrane

2204
01:51:27,232 --> 01:51:27,744
What

2205
01:51:28,768 --> 01:51:30,304
Resale and then

2206
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:32,608
The other cell an amoeba

2207
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:35,424
The guts

2208
01:51:36,192 --> 01:51:36,960
Mitochondria

2209
01:51:37,216 --> 01:51:37,728
Check

2210
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:40,544
Michelle it's just killed

2211
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:43,360
Spell up

2212
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:45,920
Bellevue go to Twitter

2213
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:49,248
A red line under the comments this morning

2214
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:50,528
More

2215
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:55,904
Oh poor cell it's so sad it's so mean it's true

2216
01:51:56,160 --> 01:52:02,048
All the shows how we need the vaccine to save us oh my God these horrible YouTube comments

2217
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:06,912
And I show all this compassion

2218
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:12,032
For the shell

2219
01:52:14,592 --> 01:52:15,872
But not the compassion

2220
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:17,152
The unborn baby

2221
01:52:17,408 --> 01:52:22,528
Yeah my God a man

2222
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:24,832
Quite effective

2223
01:52:27,648 --> 01:52:28,160
I mean

2224
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:28,928
That's

2225
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:32,512
That's a Twist at the end that I almost want to relive

2226
01:52:32,768 --> 01:52:35,072
That's that's that's so f******

2227
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:36,352
Serious

2228
01:52:36,608 --> 01:52:38,656
M Night Shyamalan level twist

2229
01:52:39,168 --> 01:52:40,704
Surprised you didn't know

2230
01:52:41,216 --> 01:52:44,544
Norco most evil found Alex

2231
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:45,568
Stop

2232
01:52:45,824 --> 01:52:50,432
Paying attention to freaking murder replies

2233
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:56,576
REI when I was growing up I always resented it when I would go to the library

2234
01:52:56,832 --> 01:52:57,600
And I pick out a book

2235
01:52:57,856 --> 01:53:00,160
Can somebody that wanted the Librarians or something would be like

2236
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:02,976
This is above your lip reading level I don't think you want to do that

2237
01:53:03,232 --> 01:53:08,096
Cuz I was like no I can I can absolutely read at this level and I want to learn more

2238
01:53:08,352 --> 01:53:10,400
And now I'm like oh I

2239
01:53:10,656 --> 01:53:15,520
Totally understand like the moment he starts talking about cells I want to be like no no no

2240
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:17,312
We got to go all the way back

2241
01:53:17,568 --> 01:53:23,712
You're not ready for this yet I cut out a long portion or he tries to talk about mitochondria just because I was on my

2242
01:53:23,968 --> 01:53:30,112
My God as I could I couldn't even handle it this is above your reading level

2243
01:53:30,368 --> 01:53:30,880
You're trying hard

2244
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:31,904
You bring up an inch

2245
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:38,304
Everything idea about this like beyond your reading level thing because I think I think there's like a dynamic

2246
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:43,168
When you're younger and you're like trying to read above your reading level

2247
01:53:43,424 --> 01:53:47,008
Good because what you're doing is challenging yourself and like

2248
01:53:47,264 --> 01:53:50,848
Do you know a blade on a on a

2249
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:57,504
And I think that you can grow through that as long as you step up to the challenge of this other

2250
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:03,904
Material maybe you don't fully understand it all the time but you pick up some pieces accept it with except your face

2251
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:05,696
Failures with humility as

2252
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:11,328
Corrections to be deposited the reverse which is

2253
01:54:11,584 --> 01:54:16,960
He faces a lot of his ideas on YouTube comments and Twitter replies

2254
01:54:17,216 --> 01:54:17,728
I am like

2255
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:20,288
That is reading below anyone's

2256
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:21,056
Reading level

2257
01:54:22,336 --> 01:54:22,848
Basing

2258
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:24,640
Ideas on that just

2259
01:54:24,896 --> 01:54:25,664
Nuggets often

2260
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:30,272
Like there is nothing there is no challenge to that there's nothing

2261
01:54:30,528 --> 01:54:36,672
If you want to make whatever argument you want you can find Twitter replies that'll make that for you.

2262
01:54:36,928 --> 01:54:41,536
It's just a shortcut to being able to make whatever point you want and pretending it's based on something

2263
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:44,096
Look somebody think of the unborn babies

2264
01:54:44,352 --> 01:54:46,400
They care so much about this cell

2265
01:54:46,656 --> 01:54:47,424
Stupid

2266
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:52,544
All these people are saying it on Twitter is there for

2267
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:53,568
It has meaning

2268
01:54:53,824 --> 01:54:59,456
Yeah there is there is something to be said about it extreme of passive information

2269
01:54:59,712 --> 01:55:03,040
Completely ruining your ability to actively search for a

2270
01:55:06,624 --> 01:55:12,000
Yeah so I started reading a lot more whenever I quit Twitter

2271
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:15,584
God imagine if my work process was

2272
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:17,120
Finding Twitter comments

2273
01:55:17,376 --> 01:55:19,168
But we're against

2274
01:55:19,424 --> 01:55:25,568
The number of things the number of slight changes to either of our personalities at this whole thing Falls

2275
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:28,128
Stop the news

2276
01:55:30,176 --> 01:55:30,944
There is a clip of

2277
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:33,760
Keanu Reeves that Alex didn't see that he is

2278
01:55:34,016 --> 01:55:34,784
Decided to drop

2279
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:37,856
Conclusions about the new forgot that

2280
01:55:38,112 --> 01:55:39,648
Also accelerate another scalp

2281
01:55:41,184 --> 01:55:42,720
I love

2282
01:55:42,976 --> 01:55:44,000
I love because

2283
01:55:44,256 --> 01:55:45,536
Complete inability to wreck

2284
01:55:45,792 --> 01:55:46,560
Recognize the like

2285
01:55:47,328 --> 01:55:50,656
It's not the cell that human beings are reacting with empathy to be

2286
01:55:51,168 --> 01:55:51,936
Situation

2287
01:55:52,192 --> 01:55:56,800
Imagine if themselves in that situation I'm going to come in there and get to other situation

2288
01:55:57,056 --> 01:56:03,200
I guess that's not a very widespread response of empathy for this I think a lot of people don't persona

2289
01:56:03,456 --> 01:56:08,576
Necessarily a cell not like the cell itself is under attack

2290
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:10,112
With your Alex

2291
01:56:10,624 --> 01:56:11,392
You do what you can

2292
01:56:11,904 --> 01:56:14,464
So there's other news and we get back to those deaths

2293
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:15,232
Those

2294
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:16,000
Big

2295
01:56:16,256 --> 01:56:20,352
Expected deaths of 90 plus year old famous people

2296
01:56:20,864 --> 01:56:21,376
But who else

2297
01:56:22,144 --> 01:56:22,656
The queen

2298
01:56:22,912 --> 01:56:23,680
This year

2299
01:56:24,448 --> 01:56:25,728
On the last day of the year

2300
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:28,800
Singers funeral mass

2301
01:56:29,056 --> 01:56:30,848
On January 5th 2023

2302
01:56:31,104 --> 01:56:32,640
And the number 23

2303
01:56:33,408 --> 01:56:37,248
Synchronicity we're going to try to get Leo zagami on the show the next few days

2304
01:56:37,504 --> 01:56:39,808
Today we need an answer I get it a holiday

2305
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:41,088
Even grieving

2306
01:56:41,344 --> 01:56:43,904
Ethan is a very

2307
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:46,976
I got that for you

2308
01:56:48,512 --> 01:56:49,792
Little point

2309
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:53,888
If the number 23 was really all that important then they probably wouldn't

2310
01:56:54,144 --> 01:56:58,752
Killed him for another day or two

2311
01:56:59,008 --> 01:57:01,056
Cuz he died in 2022 so the twins

2312
01:57:01,312 --> 01:57:06,176
3 number isn't the end it's the funeral that's important there's no one in either direction

2313
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:10,272
And the other celebrity that is about Barbara Walters

2314
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:13,856
Barbara Walters

2315
01:57:14,112 --> 01:57:17,184
Daikon

2316
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,792
Play

2317
01:57:22,048 --> 01:57:23,584
Rude

2318
01:57:24,608 --> 01:57:25,376
Respectful

2319
01:57:27,936 --> 01:57:30,240
I understand like

2320
01:57:30,496 --> 01:57:35,360
Very funny though and not liking the median what have you but that's

2321
01:57:35,616 --> 01:57:37,920
That's rude

2322
01:57:38,688 --> 01:57:40,480
Alright man cool

2323
01:57:40,992 --> 01:57:41,760
Hoo-boy

2324
01:57:42,272 --> 01:57:43,808
That's that's very funny

2325
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:45,856
So there was the news that's the news

2326
01:57:46,112 --> 01:57:46,624
Bugatti

2327
01:57:47,136 --> 01:57:49,952
That seems more reasonable for him to say about the

2328
01:57:50,208 --> 01:57:56,096
Queen that it does about Barbara Walters like Barbara Walters worked her ass off and the queen was just boring the queen you know

2329

Insane

2348
01:58:32,704 --> 01:58:33,728
Wild year

2349
01:58:33,984 --> 01:58:35,776

2350
01:58:36,288 --> 01:58:41,664
2023 is guaranteed even be more insane and will be here dutifully

01:58:43,712 --> 01:58:44,480
Cleaning on

2352
01:58:45,248 --> 01:58:47,296
Dear life we hope you keep us down there

2353
01:58:47,552 --> 01:58:48,320
God bless

2354
01:58:49,088 --> 01:58:50,112
And I'll see you in the year

2355
01:58:50,624 --> 01:58:51,136

2356
01:58:51,392 --> 01:58:51,904
23

2357
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:55,232
What a meaningless wow

Iowa

2359
01:58:57,280 --> 01:59:00,096
You know trying to find things to hold onto

2360
01:59:00,352 --> 01:59:01,632
Foothold

2361
01:59:02,656 --> 01:59:05,216
And look I don't expect much

2362
01:59:05,984 --> 01:59:10,336
This guy is disappointed me for coming on six years now or whatever you don't like it

2363
01:59:10,848 --> 01:59:13,408
I get it he sucks

2364
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:17,248
No big deal where where a little bit late to be surprised by it now

2365
01:59:17,504 --> 01:59:18,528
Still surprised at how bad

2366
01:59:18,784 --> 01:59:19,296
And this was

2367
01:59:19,552 --> 01:59:20,064
I mean like

2368
01:59:20,832 --> 01:59:21,344
Some

2369
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:27,744
Do what number do do song anything

2370
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,280
Why we can't do a year-end

2371
01:59:29,536 --> 01:59:32,096
Roundup or anything because we go too far

2372
01:59:32,608 --> 01:59:34,400
We be like well if we're going to do with your Roundup

2373
01:59:34,656 --> 01:59:39,776
We have to do it I would rewrite Auld Lang Syne

2374
01:59:40,032 --> 01:59:44,384
It would be nearly the resources hours

2375
01:59:47,456 --> 01:59:48,480
This is just

2376
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:50,272
Just

2377
01:59:50,784 --> 01:59:53,344
I don't know it's a wet blanket on a year

2378
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:56,416
You know he could have he could have tried

2379
01:59:56,672 --> 01:59:57,440
Instead

2380
01:59:57,696 --> 01:59:58,208
It's just

2381
01:59:58,464 --> 02:00:00,256
Excessive begging for money

2382
02:00:00,768 --> 02:00:03,584
Rambling about meaningless nonsense about a

2383
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:05,376
F****** Satan dial

2384
02:00:05,632 --> 02:00:07,168
And then

2385
02:00:07,424 --> 02:00:09,216
Actual Newsies covering

2386
02:00:09,472 --> 02:00:14,592
Are clips that he saw on Twitter a man celebrity deaths he doesn't care about and one

2387
02:00:14,848 --> 02:00:19,712
Maybe that he could have covered but Leo zagami didn't answer his phone

2388
02:00:19,968 --> 02:00:20,736
What you going to say

2389
02:00:23,296 --> 02:00:23,808
Can't do it

2390
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:25,344
And then also

2391
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:26,624
Blake let's not forget

2392
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:28,672
The promise of the predictions

2393
02:00:28,928 --> 02:00:29,696
Just being

2394
02:00:29,952 --> 02:00:31,488
Sweetly unpaid off

2395
02:00:31,744 --> 02:00:33,536
Think I'm going to go to the woods

2396
02:00:33,792 --> 02:00:35,840
And now we learn here on Sunday didn't even go to the

2397
02:00:36,352 --> 02:00:38,912
So how are we going to find out what's going to happen in the future

2398
02:00:39,424 --> 02:00:44,288
If Alex does believe he can see the future he is depriving us of

2399
02:00:44,544 --> 02:00:49,152
A vision of the future by not going to the Woods by not locking himself in his office

2400
02:00:50,688 --> 02:00:52,736
By not doing that he is

2401
02:00:52,992 --> 02:00:54,272
Harming the world

2402
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:55,552
Yes

2403
02:00:58,368 --> 02:01:01,696
To actually follow the things that Alex believes

2404
02:01:01,952 --> 02:01:03,744
To their logical

2405
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:04,512
Conclusion

2406
02:01:05,536 --> 02:01:10,144
One can only assume that Alex Jones himself is doing massive amounts of harm to the world

2407
02:01:10,656 --> 02:01:11,168
B

2408
02:01:11,424 --> 02:01:11,936
Lacey

2409
02:01:13,728 --> 02:01:15,520
I can sign off on that

2410
02:01:15,776 --> 02:01:16,544
That's what he believed

2411
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:20,896
You know what it's ironic because I think it if you tried harder he would do more damage

2412
02:01:21,152 --> 02:01:23,712
Because he does such

2413
02:01:23,968 --> 02:01:24,736
Little work

2414
02:01:24,992 --> 02:01:26,016
His carelessness

2415
02:01:26,272 --> 02:01:32,416
Describes a lot of problems too I think you probably cause as much damage whether he did a lot of work or not

2416
02:01:32,672 --> 02:01:33,696
What kind of damage

2417
02:01:33,952 --> 02:01:36,000
In in my estimation of him

2418
02:01:36,512 --> 02:01:38,304
I think regardless of what he does

2419
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:41,632
He should probably have two or three people watching him and controlling his baby

2420
02:01:41,888 --> 02:01:44,192
You know like he can't he can't not

2421
02:01:44,448 --> 02:01:45,472
Be the worst

2422
02:01:45,984 --> 02:01:46,496
Identify

2423
02:01:47,264 --> 02:01:48,288
He's just the worst

2424
02:01:48,544 --> 02:01:53,664
Steps like I said improvised murder Phantom

2425
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:54,432
Do you know

2426
02:01:54,688 --> 02:01:55,456
I don't disagree

2427
02:01:56,224 --> 02:01:58,528
So I was going to happen was that

2428
02:01:58,784 --> 02:01:59,552
Next episode

2429
02:02:00,832 --> 02:02:01,344
Define doubt

2430
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:02,368
If you get to these predict

2431
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:05,440
Can batter

2432
02:02:05,696 --> 02:02:10,304
To know these predictions I'm going to be running like a hawk

2433
02:02:10,816 --> 02:02:15,680
I'm going to be I'm going I'm going to be going a fine-tooth comb through everything he puts out

2434
02:02:16,192 --> 02:02:22,336
Until he gives me the predictions of what's going to happen this year I'm not picking any New Year's

2435
02:02:22,592 --> 02:02:26,432
Is predictions or anything like that I don't do that not what I'm interested in though dad

2436
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:28,480
What is your prediction

2437
02:02:28,736 --> 02:02:30,016
For one of Alex's predict

2438
02:02:30,528 --> 02:02:33,088
What do you think one of his predictions Maybe

2439
02:02:34,112 --> 02:02:35,648
Lockdown

2440
02:02:35,904 --> 02:02:38,720
Another bio-weapon probably

2441
02:02:38,976 --> 02:02:43,840
Something like that one big swing. Here's my guess on his big swing Hillary becomes president

2442
02:02:44,608 --> 02:02:46,400
My guess on his big swing

2443
02:02:46,912 --> 02:02:48,448
Is he's going to say

2444
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:49,984
That they're going to take out

2445
02:02:51,008 --> 02:02:51,520
For real

2446
02:02:53,056 --> 02:02:56,128
I don't know how to but I have that concrete of a prediction

2447
02:02:56,384 --> 02:02:58,944
But we'll see I don't know

2448
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:00,736
Here's what I'm willing to do

2449
02:03:01,504 --> 02:03:02,016
Nevermind

2450
02:03:02,272 --> 02:03:08,160
I'm going to walk this back I was going to say I'm willing to go to the woods with Alex in order to get these predictions

2451
02:03:08,416 --> 02:03:13,024
But no I am not I'd like to go to the woods but Alex would ruin

2452
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:17,376
So anyway we'll be back hopefully with some predictions of the future

2453
02:03:17,632 --> 02:03:23,008
Until then we website

2454
02:03:23,264 --> 02:03:24,800
Yep

2455
02:03:25,056 --> 02:03:26,080
Until then I'm Neo

2456
02:03:26,336 --> 02:03:27,872
I'm Leo I'm dzx Clark

2457
02:03:28,384 --> 02:03:33,760
I'm going to go lock myself in my office with the lights off and a penlight for 7 hours

2458
02:03:34,272 --> 02:03:35,040
To see the future

2459
02:03:36,832 --> 02:03:37,600
What the sex robots

2460
02:03:42,208 --> 02:03:45,792
Alex
