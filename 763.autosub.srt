1
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge by now I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guy

2
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Nike.com

5
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:06,048
I'm trying to talk a little bit about

6
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:09,120
Alex Jones

7
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:11,168
Jordan Tim Jordan

8
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:17,568
For you buddy what's up

9
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,104
Wings on at the library

10
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,408
It's being built

11
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,200
I'll be in burnt down

12
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:25,760
Are Library of Alexandria as soon as the one-year talk

13
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,296
Talking about no no

14
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:33,696
A modern-day Library

15
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:39,072
Will be burned out eventually

16
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:43,936
Number of issues of the American opinion and what-have-you John Birch Society that collection is coming

17
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,496
Together

18
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,288
To think about like

19
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,336
Start with a little bit of specialization

20
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,872
Because

21
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,176
Who's going to be randomly trying to

22
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,200
Define things

23
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:59,808
That makes the haunted little bit more more challenging but I don't have a real Target

24
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,880
Until I decided they were I'm going to begin by trying to

25
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,904
Compile as much a

26
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,488
As a can of revillo polliver works

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,024
And I found some

28
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,864
The very terrible things so far

29
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,888
Deliverance

30
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,912
Real terrible

31
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,936
Very

32
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,776
The reason I chose

33
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,800
To go in this

34
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,568
Misdirection

35
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:26,176
Is partially because it believed that a lot of his ideas about the wax

36
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,992
And the Western man and Chris

37
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,808
Things are very relevant to the right-wing

38
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,368
As it exists now and I think a lot of people

39
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,904
Don't have that thread

40
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,672
Coppola Maybe

41
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,720
Flooring that a little bit could be helpful

42
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,768
But then the other thing was that when you

43
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,048
You think about the John Birch

44
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,072
Society which is

45
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,352
Cornerstone

46
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,400
The materials that are that are going to

47
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,936
In this thing I'm putting

48
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,704
Together

49
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,240
The first meeting

50
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,520
That they had

51
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,056
The founding members

52
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:56,896
Is that were there a lot of these people were business

53
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,944
We were industrialist

54
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,016
They were members of the National Association of Manufacturers

55
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,552
You know it.

56
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,832
Most fat

57
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:08,160
Candyman

58
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:12,000
Haha

59
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:12,768
To work

60
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,376
You know I am sure they had ideas they weren't primarily idea

61
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,912
Where is

62
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,728
Review lopi Oliver with somebody who is there

63
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,264
And he's an ideas guy

64
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,408
Can somebody who has a lot of

65
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,176
Fury

66
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,224
About stuff and when

67
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,248
You know

68
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,016
What do you look at

69
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:34,784
That

70
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,088
Constellation of people

71
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,160
That's the person that I find most interesting

72
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:43,232
The person who's going to have more writings

73
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,768
That have like

74
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,560
Implications for maybe

75
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,608
The way that the organization

76
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:55,008
Well yeah of course I mean the businessmen are obviously Outsourcing their thoughts to other people to they

77
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,800
They don't have time to think

78
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,104
And I'm sure they have some

79
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,384
Get some thoughts

80
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,920
My

81
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:08,064
I thought it's an idea needs a to make a sound better

82
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,112
I'm so excited about that

83
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,648
I've got his against

84
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,416
The grain

85
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,464
Here in front of me

86
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,791
The first the writings of Professor revillo Pendleton Oliver

87
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:21,119
And there's a number

88
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,911
Chapters in here that

89
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,191
I think I think

90
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,519
Speak for themselves spell trouble

91
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,847
There's a nice

92
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:34,431
Editorial here a white Christian racist defends his faith

93
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,223
I mean

94
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,039
Brushing Lee straightforward

95
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,575
I would accept that

96
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,623
Especially if it was a white

97
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,391
Erase

98
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,207
This defense is racism by just being like

99
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,743
I really want to

100
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,023
Fbm

101
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:55,167
There's one chapter in the larger section Race and History distortion

102
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,983
There's a subchapter Anne Frank's diary

103
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:02,079
Great

104
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,151
Yeah so this is the direction that some things

105
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,455
They're taking here with the the library no some

106
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,759
A little bit

107
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,063
Slow in posting pictures

108
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,623
Little update about that

109
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,463
You know how we've seen so many

110
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,023
Failed stand-up comedians become right-wing

111
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,071
You talkin we have idiots

112
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,351
What's great about

113
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,887
Ravello is that

114
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,423
He was a ridge

115
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,191
Generally

116
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,727
The great reveal

117
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:30,751
And because of

118
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,287
Has failed magic career well

119
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,311
Here we are

120
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,591
I wonder if it is

121
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:39,967
Pronounce reveal Arevalo

122
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,247
Close

123
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,319
But we never hear his name spoken aloud

124
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,111
He's he's like

125
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:46,879
Given name

126
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:50,463
I think that is it like but it is also an aunt like

127
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,487
Palindrome

128
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:56,351
Reveal Opie Oliver is a palindrome

129
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,399
That's f******

130
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,215
That noise a little bit

131
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,007
If that's the case I got to blame is Paris

132
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,055
I mean I think

133
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:11,455
He deserves a response that you could change your name I don't know

134
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,247
This is his name and why

135
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,527
That's annoying

136
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:20,671
My bright spot is I finally got turned on or I finally listened

137
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,207
Listen to the big

138
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,231
Big Thief album

139
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:27,839
From last year strong new warm mountain or whatever it's called

140
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:33,215
Big Thief featuring Chief Keef

141
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:33,983
Not that one

142
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:38,335
I don't know I don't know how to answer

143
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:41,663
Rigby for a long time

144
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,479
Because to me for a long time they sounded like

145
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,247
If Court

146
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,271
Courtney Barnett

147
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,807
Headed gang gang dance

148
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:51,391
I know that means nothing to some people but yours was great

149
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,439
Big Thief

150
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,231
But I don't know where to slot the

151
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:01,887
I don't know I don't know how many other people and I don't know what they are

152
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,543
Is this rapid was Pope

153
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,335
Can you name people in my guy

154
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,127
I don't know them either I'll tell you this

155
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,407
Skepta loaded everything

156
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,687
Okay that's the problem

157
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,783
You know there's a little bit of everything in there and it's not always focused

158
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,367
It's enough to be good at the thing that they're doing this album is good

159
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,159
Okay

160
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,487
A great is there any

161
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,767
What's that

162
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,303
Genre that I

163
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,583
I loathe

164
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,911
God dammit

165
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,239
I don't know

166
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:44,895
Soft rock

167
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:48,991
Most of it is too chill for me

168
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:52,063
That's right that this discovery I find it

169
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,879
To relax

170
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,439
This is making me worry about the future

171
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:00,255
Yeah I don't I don't appreciate that

172
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,047
They're either still relax

173
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,071
Text until order

174
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,351
They're putting that

175
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,375
Like image on

176
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,399
Right right right

177
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:09,215
Deceiving you it's actually terrifying right

178
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,519
The implications of inertia

179
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,335
Bossa Nova

180
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:23,551
I don't know is there a is there a Bossa Nova type of influence

181
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:28,671
Antonio Carlos Jobim kind of

182
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,463
There is no

183
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,743
Bossa Nova

184
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:38,399
Maybe you call Big V fast little bosanova there

185
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,471
Okay

186
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:45,567
Anyway I'm glad you're enjoying that outfit

187
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:50,943
Episode

188
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,503
End-of-the-year broadcast Arkansas

189
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,551
December 31st moon on all of my checks

190
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,855
And we had the teas

191
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,415
From Alex he was going to

192
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,719
Reveal his predictions

193
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,535
For the coming year and I decided

194
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,559
I can't do that

195
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:10,655
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to lock myself in my office for 67 hours

196
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:15,263
Tell my wife I'm not coming home right I'm going to take care of this and it's got to be dark in that office

197
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,799
And then he's like fuc

198
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,615
You know what I'll do you one better go into the woods

199
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:26,015
Right for a couple days escalating to I'm going to the woods for a couple of days

200
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:29,087
God has got to tell him stuff and I can only happen in

201
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,623
And he needs to cry and walk

202
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:38,559
So we tuned in as we were recording a last episode on Alex's Sunday show

203
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:42,143
He was in studio interesting but he did not go to the woods

204
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,191
Did they turn all the lights off so we could talk

205
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:44,959
In the dark

206
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,519
But he barely talked

207
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,055
He wasn't talking about that much

208
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,615
Okay it was an interview with Francis Boyle

209
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,663
Francis Boyle

210
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,223
The guy who is a bioweapon

211
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,271
Pain specialists of some sort

212
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,295
Apparently some thoughts

213
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,063
But Ukraine

214
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,671
A pointless interview we did not get predictions about the year

215
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,279
And then the second hour

216
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,559
I was just rerun

217
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,583
Alex

218
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,143
So well

219
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,167
Here's the thing

220
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:18,495
I tuned in on Monday and what do I find

221
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:36,415
Yeah

222
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,463
No I'm still on Earth

223
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:44,863
Sure but I've been forwards is still on Earth 2023

224
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:49,215
No. This is arbitrary

225
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:53,055
Demarcation of time I refuse to acknowledge that is an

226
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,847
The new

227
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,639
D-Generation X

228
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:03,039
No the New Age Outlaws Harrison Smith and Owen Shroyer

229
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
Fuse

230
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,135
You've got Harrison Smith

231
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,415
Final movie

232
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,975
The snooze

233
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,999
Put you to sleep

234
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:16,351
You just start talking for a long time

235
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,703
No but it's me matically fitting

236
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,775
But then Alex I guess would be

237
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,055
Triple H

238
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,335
Or maybe

239
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,359
Shawn Michaels

240
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,687
I mean I think he's more Hulk Hogan now

241
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:36,063
Well that's that's like the New World Order

242
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:40,927
Attitude Era is not as complete as yours

243
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:45,791
Cousin Buckley is Ravishing Rick Rude

244
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:53,215
Savannah Hernandez cuz she's the only female that I think is still around

245
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,751
Billy Weaver's gone

246
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,055
Kaitlin Bennett I don't think

247
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,591
You still around I don't even know if

248
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,359
She still around

249
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,919
Actually works

250
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,199
Like she work for The Blaze

251
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,503
But she still has a channel on Bad. Video

252
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:09,343
Nick Fuentes could be Ravishing Rick Rude cuz he had a mustache

253
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,903
Mustache

254
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,511
Anyway Alex's Underwood's it appears

255
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,047
On Monday or something

256
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
He's just not there

257
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,119
So that left me in a little bit of a bind

258
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,143
Because I was

259
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,167
Obviously wanting

260
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,959
To get to these predict

261
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,775
I'm very excited about that I want to know what's coming

262
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,847
Responsibility

263
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,871
And I'm not

264
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,663
Boy he really is a psychic too

265
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,479
So anyway I felt like

266
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:43,391
I wanted to tell the world that we don't have the predictions

267
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,463
That is not a full episode

268
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:50,559
I am so I thought like well we can spring collect 2003 we can make some progress

269
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,839
2003

270
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,375
And it Dawn

271
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,423
That actually

272
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,447
We are right

273
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,983
At the point where Saddam

274
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:58,751
Gets found

275
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,663
You got found on December 13th okay 2003 and our next episode as we're progressing

276
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,943
Through will be December

277
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:11,295
So here we are okay we get to figure out what

278
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,087
When Alex

279
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,111
Heard the news

280
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,647
That does damu saying

281
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,415
I was about

282
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,743
Clearly if I remember my

283
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
It was

284
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,559
Czechoslovakia who did it

285
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,863
Correct know they drained the dogs

286
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,167
That's found Saddam

287
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,407

I-beam

298
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,223
I don't know why nobody's tried that would be

299
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,039
Before I feel like that was that's been there for

300
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,855
We're on episode 762 or what

301
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:23,743

304
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,727
And we got a technocrat in the mix

305
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:39,615
Apology to because they wanted me to play an out-of-context A Drop of myself

306
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,687
But I don't know where that is in the emails

307
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,735
And they sent me this message

308
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,503
A couple months

309
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,063
I have no idea

310
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,647
But if they resend that email baby I'll play it in the future

311
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,671
Or something

312
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,975
But in lieu of that they asked

313
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,535
Score

314
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:03,167
Danielle had a great idea for a shout-out but Dan and Jordan didn't listen and now you're all stuck with this stupid shout-out

315
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,191
Thank you so much

316
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,471
You are not a threat

317
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:10,847
Don't get mad until you're brilliant someone

318
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,871
Sodomites

319
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,439
Jesus Christ

320
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:29,023
Thank you so much

321
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,791
Begets

322
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,583
If I understand correctly

323
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,863
Were they was that

324
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,679
Referring to if you decided not to play the clip

325
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:40,543
Then they would be like well this one would be good yeah here's the name if you don't want to do this

326
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,871
I mean shuttle big at you

327
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,151
That's fantastic

328
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:51,807
I appreciate her but it also could be talked into this is too much of a hassle absolutely

329
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,575
Sorry about that

330
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:56,927
We got this episode to do and I want to say a little tease

331
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,231
And that is that if you stick around

332
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:05,631
Until the end of the episode we will have a new song by DJ Daniel that we forgot to play earlier

333
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,215
We're great you know what it's

334
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,239
It's one thing

335
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,287
To just like yeah we kind of forget things

336
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:13,823
When it's like

337
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:18,943
A couple in a row it doesn't feel great so there is

338
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,735
You and I both have

339
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,783
Strenuously avoided

340
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,855
But there are reasons people have other people work on

341
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,927
Yeah that's true

342
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:32,255
Staffs there people designated to remember

343
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,535
Bright

344
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,303
Yeah

345
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:38,143
Never going to happen with us but

346
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,983
Looking over at the other person Hoover this show

347
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,871
Could maybe get a planner or something

348
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,151
How do I

349
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,943
There'll be a new song

350
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,967
The Highwaymen

351
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:55,039
Episode

352
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,623
And I we start on the 12th

353
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,415
Actually we don't have any clips

354
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,719
It is a boring show nothing happens

355
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,255
I

356
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,303
I couldn't find anything to grab onto

357
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,095
Alex is killing time

358
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,887
It is not even interesting

359
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:10,911
But

360
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,447
There's a commercial

361
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,031
That I heard on that episode that I thought was worth bringing

362
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,311
Everyone's attention

363
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:24,223
These drugs prescribed for free

364
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,295
Doctors are prescribing drugstore

365
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,623

366
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,535
Anti-anxiety

367
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,815
The list goes on and on

368
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,583
3 / 50

369
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,887

Drug shopping

377
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,559
Kind of like it's one thing

378
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:16,959
I don't know actually I'm not going to drink couches and everything ends up like muscle relaxants painkillers

379
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:21,823
The kids are some dangerous things to be taking outside the supervision of like

380
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,871
Doctors Care

381
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,663
Soma is one of the things

382
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:31,039
I mean when you're when you're on a commercial

383
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,575
The one thing

384
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,623
I'm listening for is if you are

385
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,647
Reinforcing

386
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,927
Once more

387
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,207
Just so you know

388
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,999
We have speed and dick pills

389
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,559
I think we know what people are asking

390
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,351
40K

391
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:47,935
Okay we're doing this for a while

392
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:54,335
Drugs now

393
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,895
Gintama kids are going to solve all your problems

394
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:00,479
What's today I mean this is a mess but it's also there is

395
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,759
There's an element of it that

396
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,039
Plays just deeply

397
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:03,807
Unethical

398
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,111
This can't be legal

399
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:06,879
Right

400
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,951
I don't know is it wasn't legal 2003

401
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,023
Look I don't know enough about the law and I assume that it is

402
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,583
I assume it's somewhere it's legal

403
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,911
Be there some sort of a loophole or something then

404
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:22,751
I'm not saying that there is to be arrested

405
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,031
Teacher pill terrible

406
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:29,407
Like eyevertising for the Emmy I think that it's even dicey to advertise like gambling

407
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,967
Yeah I think that's a little bit Shady

408
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,527
I think I think even

409
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:39,647
Maybe I'm bore anti advertising been a lot of folks but I understand people taking a

410
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,415
Eggs for

411
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,207
Some things that could

412
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,999
Eventually be dangerous

413
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,535
But like this

414
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:50,911
Is a do you want free access to medications that could

415
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
Potentially

416
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,959
We we destroy your life

417
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:56,287
And I'm Alex Jones somebody who hates

418
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:02,943
Pharmaceuticals control meds

419
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,223
Psychiatric drugs

420
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,015
Take speed and dick pills

421
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,063
Preferably together and with alcohol

422
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:14,463
Psychiatric meds to

423
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,487
Is a problem

424
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,303
Hindsight's 20

425
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,095
But if I was

426
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,679
I'm sorry

427
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,359
It is

428
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,639
Soak

429
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:36,735
Clear like oh yeah the opioid crisis is 100% coming

430
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,783
100% carbon

431
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,575
Yeah yeah you know

432
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,623
Alex Jones

433
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:46,719
There should be appointed which like I understand that this ad is probably run

434
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,511
I'm through Midas resources or Janice

435
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,559
You know like this is Ted Anderson

436
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,327
Since fall

437
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,607
But if I were Alex

438
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,911
I will put some

439
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,679
Sort of

440
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:58,239
Standards in place where I'm like no

441
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,519
You don't do this

442
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,055
We were going to get

443
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:05,407
You're going to run the risk of getting our audience addicted to pills here at will.

444
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:08,991
Destroy their lives well they maybe don't need them or

445
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,015
I mean

446
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:16,416
That would only make sense if they were operating under similar rules as like a is like a drug dealer of some sort you know like

447
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:20,000
They would do something like say the first taste is free

448
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:24,096
And then later on whenever you came back to them because you're addicted to it

449
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:24,864
You wouldn't

450
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,912
Get it for free but clearly that's

451
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,448
Wait a second dance

452
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,264
Well they're not going to be shipping a freezer law

453
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,336
Yeah that sucks

454
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,408
The 12th is a Friday

455
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,456
The Weeknd

456
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,992
Comes and goes

457
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,296
Saddam got captured over the weekend

458
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,832
And so on the 50

459
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:48,672
Monday always do a deuce dump on the weekend yet

460
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:55,840
I'm trying to find a way to connect this to like you always get fired on a Friday

461
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:59,168
Empire dad Auto Pride

462
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,472
On Monday

463
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,496
And

464
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,288
Here is where he's at

465
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,104
I mean at least doesn't beat around the bush you just

466
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,128
To the news

467
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,952
Houston Texas

468
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,512
Morning-after that's why you doing

469
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,896
In the

470
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,992
Before

471
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,344
The governor

472
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,960
What up what up monumentous weekend

473
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:11,616
I mean first of all you had Saddam getting captured and then Alex was at the Alamo Drafthouse

474
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,896
Movie screening

475
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:15,456
I have to say that I think Alex is a little bit

476
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,224
Annoyed

477
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,504
Did Saddam got captured

478
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,272
Because

479
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,576
Kind of makes it so you can't just talk about

480
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:26,976
The the show and how much of a success it was assuming that Alex would be annoyed if he had gone down on the plane with the Big Bopper

481
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,000
Fred wasn't given

482
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,024
Had billing

483
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,304
You know like that kind of

484
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,352
Alex will be very frustrated if he lost

485
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,376
Any

486
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,400
Clapdaddie one

487
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:38,752
Wait what you're saying that he would be upset if he was on the plane with the Big Bopper

488
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,032
Buddy Holly

489
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,056
Oh wow what

490
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:47,712
Backwards by bad I'm backwards if you only reason I bring it up is big

491
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:54,112
Because it runs counter to the argument

492
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:01,024
Suffer out there playing in Chicago

493
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:07,424
What's the problem it's all there

494
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,240
It's really true though it hurts

495
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:13,824
So we don't really know what Alex's Vibe is

496
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,872
You know there is

497
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,408
Kind of thing these supposed

498
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,432
The capture

499
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:21,760
But there's not really a sense that he's like this is fake

500
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,040
Or anything

501
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,088
And that continued

502
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,400
It was him

503
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,008
Why do

504
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:48,896
Don't know

505
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:53,760
It's kind of refreshing to your Alex or say that he has no idea what the reality of a given situation is

506
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,832
You never hear him show that kind of weakness these days

507
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:59,392
But in the past Alex's brand was being a

508
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,672
Smart truth-teller

509
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:04,768
Not that he's a prophet ordained by God and given a divine revelation

510
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,304
And a guy who can also

511
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,072
See the future

512
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:10,912
Can sustain a little bit of uncertainty in 2000

513
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,680
3 which is

514
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,704
Just kind of

515
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,728
Like a normal person

516
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:16,544
Me not knowing things is actually one of the most

517
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,104
You're one of the strongest

518
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,640
Things that a truth-teller does

519
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,920
Not know that

520
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:26,016
Right2know

521
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:28,064
One who speaks does not know

522
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,832
Exactly

523
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,880
No

524
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,160
. blood

525
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,024
That being said all that being said

526
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,560
Alex is not being above board

527
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:42,656
All the surface he's saying that he doesn't know what to think but he's very clearly

528
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,960
Trying to imply to the audience that they should

529
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,752
Think that the capture of Saddam was Fay

530
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,152
All the external context that he had so the coverage serves only to justify coming to the conclusion that it was

531
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,968
How to draw their captures have been faked

532
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:58,528
Before which is supposed to make the listener feel like

533
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,576
Deciding saddam's captors

534
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,112
Is a more rational a

535
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,232
You may notice that Alex is not doing this kind of insinuation

536
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,512
In the other direction

537
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,304
Providing defenses for the listener

538
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,864
Who may be inclined to think that the capture was legit

539
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,168
That's because there is a conclusion Alex

540
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,448
What is driving at

541
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,728
If he's trying to hide behind

542
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,496
Pretending that

543
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,032
He's clueless and I don't know what

544
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:20,800
I think

545
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,336
I mean

546
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,384
It's obviously

547
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,432
More likely for him to lean towards

548
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,200
It was fake

549
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,992
I mean that's

550
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:29,760
Is

551
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:30,528
Bailiwick

552
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,064
You know on the road today

553
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:35,392
I'm a little confused as to why he's not in this one

554
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,184
You know in this

555
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,208
Particular

556
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,024
Situation I feel like with the knowledge of

557
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:47,424
Saddam's doubles all over the place you know everybody knew that was going around roof

558
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,448
Really good shot at least

559
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,240
Is it for a few days

560
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,520
Albion like

561
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,544
I don't think it was him

562
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,592
They have to prove it I think they're fake

563
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:58,688
I had a couple thoughts about that we'll we'll get into that a little bit as

564
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,456
Things go along

565
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:04,576
But also interesting Lee there is not really any inclination

566
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,600
Towards the double

567
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:09,440
And stop even though he does bring up that there were doubles he

568
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,208
Sweetie

569
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,512
Insisted that this is actually Saddam

570
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,304
Interested yeah because he

571
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,400
He was saying that some other time

572
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,168
In the Knox

573
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,448
Too distant past

574
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,776
Some other picture of Saddam was a double

575
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,824
He has a lot of ideas about whether or not

576
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,592
Saddam's next

577
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,384
Toothpick

578
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,992
Question for him I but I do believe he measures next week

579
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,064
Critical

580
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,392
It's a saying that man has a real thick neck

581
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,184
Yeah so Alex continues

582
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,464
To pretend that there's like

583
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,000
I don't know what's going on here

584
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,608
The war

585
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,400
Was not Saddam

586
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,648
We know that was

587
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:40,320
What Alex is doing here is teaching his audience how to argue a point while knowing

588
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,368
Nothing about the actual point your argue

589
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:46,208
Leaving aside the dubious nature of some of the points Alex

590
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:46,976
Just listed off

591
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,512
Even if all of that was

592
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:52,352
Totally true and accurate none of it would Prove It saddam's capture was

593
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,120
Real

594
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:56,448
That's the argument he's making could conclude that the globalist

595
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,472
Star capable of fake

596
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:00,032
Eating something but that doesn't mean that they did

597
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:04,640
The goal of the style of argumentation is to overwhelm the person you're arguing with

598
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,432
It's a barrage of points

599
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:08,224
But don't prove anything but it's

600
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,552
Literally impossible for someone to respond to an oz

601
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,344
In any satisfactory way

602
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:16,416
You see this kind of behavior returning social media comment

603
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,696
So it's kind of

604
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:20,768
Kind of makes sense that I would have gravitated to strongly to that

605
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,560
Here's how I would respond

606
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:23,584
Okay

607
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,632
I would ignore most

608
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,424
I would say

609
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,984
I thought of all things

610
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,776
If I recall correctly

611
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,568
Osama had a bit of a Honker

612
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,848
I wouldn't I wouldn't

613
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:39,200
Choose the size of his nose to measure that he had a large nose

614
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:41,504
Right nothing wrong with that or give him a vets

615
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,648
It's not a nose like a banana

616
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:52,512
Can you speak playing around and shooting I was just sitting in a hole with a

617
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,792
30 wives or whatever

618
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:58,400
Wind going down that road be your first instinct was better

619
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:02,752
Which is just stay on the point that you're supposed to be talking

620
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:06,080
Think about which is the Saddam

621
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,104
Do you know about it

622
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,896
You're not he's not saying anything right

623
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,200
But that's why I feel like we need to get to

624
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,224
To the bottom of this whole song

625
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:16,832
Cuz you're not really saying anything about that but I want to know what he thinks about when he

626
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,880
PCS osama's nose you know like

627
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:21,184
What is the size that is large

628
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:21,952
Super small

629
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,232
In that pic

630
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,256
Do you know what I'm saying

631
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:33,984
I see maybe how you would want to have a good time. Arguing with Alex here but I don't think

632
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,520
Get the fruitful Road

633
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,544
Fair

634
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,360
The second goal of this kind of thing just kind of argue

635
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,664
Imitation is to make an argument without having

636
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,432
Own the fact

637
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,456
But you made that argument

638
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,272
How much is arguing that Saddam captured was fake

639
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:49,088
But he has every ability to pretend that he's not

640
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,952
If you were to say that he's making that argument he be able to weasel his way out of that by there's

641
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,488
Say that

642
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,096
Meanwhile Alex has been saying that Saddam fled to Belarus with his kids in a bunch of

643
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,632
Gold ever since he was ousted

644
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,656
Power so

645
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:06,496
If you're a person familiar with the content and narratives that are active on Infowars

646
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,104
You would know that what Alex is saying is not I don't know

647
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:16,480
He saying like basically that he wants to call it fake but he does have the right talking point

648
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,760
Anchor that claim yet

649
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,040
So he's going to play dumb

650
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:22,112
He'll take a bunch of calls and hopefully one of them will make a

651
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,672
The point that he could use to strengthen his conspiracy but me

652
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,440
Make no mistake

653
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,720
Alex isn't looking

654
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,512
For information that will help him arrive at the

655
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,304
The conclusion that the capture was real

656
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,096
If that was the case then

657
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,376
Would call into question

658
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:37,728
So many of his other narratives at the Iraq War and the pieces would start

659
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,496
The fall

660
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:42,336
It still needs to be fake in order for all these other things

661
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,104
To be maintained

662
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,664
Yeah I think that's one of the things that

663
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,992
Applicable in so many different ads

664
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,016
Except life is

665
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,296
That type of

666
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:54,368
Thing when somebody says that type of thing to you you know the

667
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,672
I'm saying this but I'm afraid to take

668
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,440
Responsibility

669
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,208
34 it

670
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,000
There is no point in like trying

671
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,024
Convince them of

672
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,072
They have no interest in being

673
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,864
Convince their they're trying to get

674
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,888
Through this

675
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,680
With what they have

676
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,216
Impact

677
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,752
Do you know well and there's a

678
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:13,824
If there is a conclusion or an ending point

679
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,360
That they're angling toward

680
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,640
And that they're going to

681
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,920
Keep moving toward

682
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,688
Regard

683
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,968
You're not going to

684
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:21,248
Talk them

685
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:27,904
From the delay so much of this other stuff is pretending to not really know and and all this

686
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,440
Is the performance

687
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,976
That kind of

688
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,000
Totally makes it

689
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,536
Seymour like Alex

690
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,072
Is doing a

691
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,400
Investigative process before he arrives right

692
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,168
Conclusion that

693
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,216
One way or another something was fake

694
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:47,616
I don't know who did this but it has that Fingerprints of every Republican I've ever seen

695
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,408
I'm just saying that they might be bringing up

696
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,688
Alex has a

697
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,992
Conspiracy here shocking

698
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,296
It's kind of

699
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:01,440
Decent way for him to go in order to maintain like I said a lot of those other trappings

700
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,744
He has that would intersect with

701
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,048
Saddam being captured

702
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:10,144
You know the I'm thinking of it more like Jenga

703
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,424
Like its

704
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,728
Pulling

705
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:14,496
Peace out

706
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,800
Does not make everything terrible

707
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:22,688
Frederick as if you were to say like oh that you do everything that they're saying about this captures totally accurate

708
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
Then the whole

709
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,248
Adult our Falls

710
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,400
What

711
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:47,776
Customer Hotel

712
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,368
Was cleared

713
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,840
Yes Alex has decided that the new way to go with it is he was a he was a prisoner

714
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,120
He was held captive

715
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,656
Right

716
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,960
You do not know when a person

717
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:26,432
I just feel like that's not I mean

718
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,736
Sometimes you know when a person's on drugs

719
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:31,296
True but you do not know when a person is on

720
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,576
Mega blanket

721
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,112
You can suspect

722
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,928
The Navy has cause to be a little bit

723
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:37,952
Suspicious

724
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,280
Seeing somebody on TV

725
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:44,608
After they've been in a hole for several days

726
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:48,960
I don't know if you can tell if they're on drugs or one way or the other

727
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:52,288
I think that might be a bit of a biased

728
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,336
Circumstance

729
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,104
Study on this

730
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,152
Being a hole for a couple days my kids

731
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:02,528
High as hell

732
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:06,624
Now do you see this is a good way for all of the

733
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,976
The things that Alex has said already to sort of biri contextualize

734
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:11,744
So

735
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,512
When

736
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,816
The when Saddam was asked

737
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,632
Different powered there was the he flew out to

738
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:21,472
Belarus

739
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,008
This Kim

740
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,288
Go along with that

741
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,824
It's like that was

742
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,104
We were wrong about that

743
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:30,176
The intel was there but they got double-crossed

744
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,456
So they kidnapped

745
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:35,296
Saddam in the hole and they were holding him

746
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,344
In order to be turned over

747
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,368
In order to

748
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,392
Give the global

749
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,160
The Big Boost

750
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:43,232
Put them on ice

751
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:46,048
Even even for Saddam they would not have

752
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,840
Put him in what amounted to a cough

753
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:48,864
Right

754
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:51,680
As far as a prison goes out at least put them in a room

755
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:52,960
Well

756
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:54,496
Yeah but

757
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,080
You hide in a coffin cuz you're trying not to be found

758
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:04,480
Or you don't want to be found until it's time for The Prestige reveal

759
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,136
The reveal that we have been keeping a sit-down with a coffin

760
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,184
Okay

761
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,232
So

762
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,256
He was

763
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,536
Coming back from Houston

764
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,840
I was listening to these talk radio station

765
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,632
Discuss the Saddam

766
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,912
Discovery

767
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,728
And he decided I got to get in the mix

768
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,040
Hotel room

769
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:43,904
Good morning

770
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,720
I'm trying as much greater thre

771
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,256
Iceland

772
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:24,864
Burbank Capt

773
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,688
What

774
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,112
Why are you calling

775
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:50,976
My regular

776
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,568
What

777
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,112
President

778
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:30,656
We've heard Alex yell at some people about lying but their calls to like seem like that I guess he's

779
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,704
Condemning himself here

780
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:35,520
No I don't believe that this happened

781
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:36,800
Necessarily

782
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:39,360
Doubtful but it's fun it's fun story

783
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,664
If it did happen

784
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,200
Which

785
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:43,968
Again I don't

786
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,040
I think

787
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:50,624
A more likely explanation for all of the things that Alex's describing

788
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,392
Is

789
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,160
That

790
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:54,976
The people who are producing a radio show

791
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,768
Had enough

792
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:57,536
Colors

793
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:01,120
Who maybe had the perspective that Alex in his own persona

794
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,424
They got the sense

795
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,216
This isn't going to be a good call

796
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:09,056
This person's going to be a pain in the ass to talk to I don't want to talk to the

797
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:09,824
This person

798
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,408
Where is his sort of Yokel character

799
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:19,808
Vetta is like I think that everybody should be

800
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:26,208
Maybe this is somebody who we don't have this voice calling in an entertaining

801
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:29,024
Come on people you got to stay listening right there might be a

802
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,584
Higher demand for that then whatever Alex

803
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,632
Just bring to the table and they're trying to do a show

804
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,680
Short so maybe that's

805
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,984
What

806
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,008
Penny Pincher

807
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,032
School.

808
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,592
Let me put you on this

809
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,152
So Alex calls in and they're like

810
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:46,688
Your Alex

811
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,480
Of course we can't punch

812
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,248
Do I dare

813
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,784
And then Alex goes in

814
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,136
Doing his cabin character and then they go hold on I'm going to have to put you on hold

815
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,416
Alicia

816
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,488
The Character Are You shiting me

817
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:01,536
We got to put this got we got to put them on

818
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,560
If he does the character

819
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:05,376
That would be fun

820
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,400
But again

821
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:12,032
It's not happening at solutely. But that is the way that I would believe it happened at it happen

822
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:12,800
Yes

823
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:18,176
So Alex spell gets a little bit more into his Saddam kidnapping Theory

824
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,832
Brog

825
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,952
All consistent with being in a coffin

826
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,280
Failure

827
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:14,496
Before the election

828
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,288
I don't think that's a bush

829
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,592
Administration

830
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,640
Let's get it

831
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:24,480
Because I do know that their first interview

832
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,760
And

833
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:26,528
Define this

834
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,064
As audio or video

835
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,624
But I have read

836
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,440
The transcript of Steve's first interview

837
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,208
Here's that they hadn't

838
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,232
Spoken before

839
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,768
And that is in 2000

840
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,304
Wow so they

841
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,864
They are in each other's lives

842
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,656
Maybe not like super

843
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,424
Closer

844
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:46,496
Email every now and again

845
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:50,080
Steve saying absolutely insane things possible

846
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:53,407
The kidney failure the Marfan syndrome thing is

847
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,455
He's a Steve Hallmark

848
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,479
Answer this

849
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,527
There's a part of me that thinks like I do that's

850
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,551
That's what Alex

851
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,575
Just trying to

852
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,111
Skewer with me

853
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,391
Trump

854
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,159
Ministration

855
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,183
Figure

856
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,207
It just

857
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,743
Checkered to me that

858
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,023
People used to

859
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,047
Text

860
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:12,095
Conspiracy theories to each other on

861
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:16,447
T9 can you imagine Flippin your razor phone open

862
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:21,055
Typing out like a long series of like here's what the Bush family

863
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:24,127
The Furious I got charged by the text back into the blue

864
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:29,759
Oh my God that's brutal he's not my plan here man come on

865
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,551
444

866
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,087
5

867
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,367
666

868
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,695
That's no good Lowe's of the days

869
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:44,351
You kids don't know what it was like trying to pill people on a flip phone

870
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:49,727
You all have it still good

871
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,263
Reviews like

872
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,543
Like

873
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,823
Newsletter

874
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,383
Far more effective

875
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:58,943
So

876
00:42:59,199 --> 00:42:59,967
Alex

877
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:03,295
He's like really trying to leave

878
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,319
The perception

879
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:07,135
That you're I don't know what's going on here could be anything

880
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:10,207
But he's very clearly trying to argue that it was

881
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,471
4

882
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:26,591
Airport

883
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,383
Everybody

884
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,207
Palmetto

885
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,815
Conclusive evidence

886
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,887
Wait

887
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:52,447
From being in a coffin

888
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:01,663
You're concerned

889
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:09,599
Alex is making a ton of arguments for why this is a

890
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:15,999
The fake capture and he's attacking people like Dan Rather in the mainstream media reporting

891
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:19,839
It could not be more clear what Alex's position is

892
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:22,911
We still doing the song and dance about not knowing what he thinks

893
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:23,935
And I think

894
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:27,263
Part of that is that this position helps persuade listener

895
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:30,847
If you comes up guns-blazing yelling about how this is fake

896
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,871
He might be able to

897
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,151
Convince some or even most

898
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:33,919
To the audience

899
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:34,687
But if he does

900
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:38,271
Is it this way where he's slow plays his argument and pretends to be neutral

901
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:40,319
Alex is able to walk the listeners

902
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,343
To the conclusion

903
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,647
While making it feel like they were the ones

904
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:44,415
Who came up with

905
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:48,511
This is a pretty solid manipulation tactics but it's also

906
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,791
Requires a little settled

907
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:52,351
All this kind of thing off

908
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,375
Live nowadays

909
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:55,935
Now that is the real vibe that I get

910
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:58,239
From the way that he's deploying is ready

911
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:01,567
Yeah you know I also have the sense that

912
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:07,967
Free I am a prophet that knows everything and I'm always right about everything 100% of the time

913
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:08,991
Maybe he

914
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,271
Wants to

915
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,295
A1c

916
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,063
To go there

917
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,087
Right away

918
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,647
But he also has to talk himself into it a little bit

919
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:17,183
He has to give himself a

920
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:17,951
Pep talk

921
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,743
On why he should

922
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,767
Give a full throat

923
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:27,423
You know it's very shortly after that I doubt he's had too much time to think about it let alone come up with a solid plan

924
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:31,007
It's Sunday morning and this is Monday

925
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,543
We had plenty of time

926
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,591
I'm sorry

927
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:37,663
Sunday morning in this is Monday so he planned

928
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,455
No I'm saying if

929
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,991
You were somebody who

930
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:45,855
No use your time wisely

931
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:52,255
I'm saying all things being equal for a human enough time to come up with an argument

932
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:58,143
Right it's not like you found out right before you got on air then

933
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:03,775
Then I whatever into it is kind of

934
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:06,079
I think there's some Merit to that

935
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:06,847
Be

936
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,895
Images of like going to

937
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:11,455
The callers that I feel like it's B I need

938
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:13,759
Find where my hand hold a is here

939
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:17,343
I need to figure out what narrative I'm going to be able to hinge this on

940
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:18,879
I think there's that

941
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:21,183
Couldn't do it

942
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,207
Today is because

943
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,999
Today his character is

944
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,279
Is All-Seeing profit

945
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,071
You know he doesn't need to talk

946
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,351
Himself into anything

947
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,375
He's seated from

948
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:31,679
Yeah there's a week

949
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,471
Weakness to uncertain

950
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:35,519
Present whereas in the past

951
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:36,543
It does not

952
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,847
It doesn't hurt his position

953
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:39,871
And his branding

954
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:41,663
22 have that

955
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,943
Sort of uncertainty

956
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,991
When you start a cult you can doubt but

957
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,271
When you get to assert

958
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,063
Point you got to be all-knowing

959
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,599
That's just how it goes

960
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:53,951
Get some calls and they're mostly dumb and not really all that interesting

961
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:57,791
Necessarily get any any

962
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:58,559
Sort of

963
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,095
Thing to hang his hat on

964
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,399
There is a tall bikes

965
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,679
The tone stays

966
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,727
Fairly consistent throughout which is

967
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:06,751
This is fake

968
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:07,775
But also

969
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,567
I'm hatching a little

970
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:12,639
But some of the calls her kind of interesting

971
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,343
Alex

972
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,415
Because when they threw him in there

973
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,183
You can see if

974
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,207
Pacific Direct

975
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:28,767
Indication of manipulation and insertion of the actress

976
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,559
When they say that he had more

977
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,607
The God of War

978
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:35,679
Cedar Inn

979
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,703
Before the Pediatric

980
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:39,007
How they place them in the god coming out

981
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:45,151
Is it like that

982
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:47,455
One year anniversary of 9/11

983
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:49,503
New York Lottery

984
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:51,807
911

985
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:52,831
Right so if I

986
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,879
Alex is responding to the caller this way

987
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:58,975
Then he's reinforcing the argument that the Mars bar is being in the

988
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:03,839
A part of a calling card that the globalist through using

989
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,375
The only the elect

990
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,399
Good day

991
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,679
See the messaging of it

992
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,447
Furthermore

993
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,471
Those things

994
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,495
Have happy

995
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,823
So if you're comparing them to things that are concrete

996
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,127
Then that would suggest

997
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,663
That so is

998
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:22,015
Conversation is always like

999
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:24,063
Barely revealing of Alex's

1000
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,343
Actual like

1001
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,135
He wants the message the audience

1002
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:29,183
Takes away from his show today

1003
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:29,951
Right

1004
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,719
I just

1005
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:32,767
Just can't get enough of

1006
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:34,559
Can't get enough of those solid

1007
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,607
Foundational arguments of

1008
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,655
A Hi-C they said this thing

1009
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:41,983
911 and this person said this thing 911 clearly

1010
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:47,103
Do not understand

1011
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,687
And even that

1012
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,991
Not really true

1013
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,015
It came up with that argument

1014
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,295
Alex

1015
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,063
Call

1016
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,087
And this person

1017
00:48:57,343 --> 00:49:00,159
I have something to ask about it

1018
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:02,975
So I wanted to

1019
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,511
I want to ask you did you ever hear of me

1020
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,535
Sarah before

1021
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,631
It isn't

1022
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,007
First Patriots

1023
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,479
Martial law

1024
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,015
Oh yeah

1025
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:26,783
I just heard

1026
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:27,551
Some about I look at

1027
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,831
Get their website but I didn't

1028
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:30,623
What to draw Anna

1029
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:31,647
Glad you know about

1030
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:34,463
That's Aurora and Jess Aurora those are the two things

1031
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:37,279
Like really popular and qanon

1032
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:42,655
Yeah I know those are like Proto q-ship National Economic Security and Recovery Act

1033
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,935
And then

1034
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:45,727
Jesser has the global

1035
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:50,591
But yeah I took this idea that all debts are going to be forgiven and I'd like

1036
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:52,639
Great

1037
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,431
For Alex to be like

1038
00:49:54,687 --> 00:50:00,575
That's bulshit there's something that is so beyond the pale

1039
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,135
He's not entertaining any that's just

1040
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:06,975
It is it is just so f****** weird to see him just be like

1041
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:07,743
Nope

1042
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,023
Bulshit

1043
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:11,839
I mean even even tried a little bit with

1044
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:14,911
You'd be like oh that's but even then he heads

1045
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:18,751
He will try to go often

1046
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,799
And then we even when he couldn't though

1047
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,847
He still didn't just go on and say like

1048
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:28,223
It's all bulshit he was like oh there right about some things he had to had to do a little bit of a middle ground

1049
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,527
You can

1050
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,063
If you think about it for a little while

1051
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,855
I think you can come up with a pretty decent

1052
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:36,159
Sense of why this has to be

1053
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:39,231
Amatis undermines his own

1054
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,255
Conspiracy

1055
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,559
Like if this does exist

1056
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:46,143
Then there is no reason to worry about the things Alex wants you to worry

1057
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:50,495
And that is completely anathema to his

1058
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:51,519
They space

1059
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,543
I mean it is

1060
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:55,871
It is still a similar kind of way of doing

1061
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:59,199
Things like keep your keep your

1062
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,735
Followers or whatever

1063
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,783
Stasis

1064
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:05,599
But in this situation it's in a stasis of like

1065
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:08,671
We're on the cusp of everything being fine don't do anything

1066
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:12,511
Another you do can really affect the coming of this

1067
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,815
Rhinoceros

1068
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:17,119
The only thing you can do to stop Nestle

1069
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,143
Is giving me money

1070
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:23,263
NFA different type of engine after fight it exactly

1071
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,031
The fight

1072
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:30,687
These are terrorists edging in in opposition to each other

1073
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:34,271
More clip here and I think

1074
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,295
That Alex is

1075
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,319
Hey, this is

1076
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,855
Basically just what we

1077
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:41,439
We've seen it's obvious that he's he thinks it's fake

1078
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,743
But the way he's talking

1079
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,023
Think about it as these

1080
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,559
These layers of

1081
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:47,839
Dynamic

1082
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:50,143
And I think

1083
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:53,727
But maybe this will develop more over the coming days back in two

1084
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,007
I will see about

1085
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,055
But for now Alex has to be wrong

1086
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,079
About this

1087
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:06,527
Amazing

1088
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,879
Or high-level bath

1089
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:14,975
We need to go back and see what it was that we said

1090
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:15,999
At the very beginning

1091
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:19,071
Cuz I wasn't sure but I think I jokingly said

1092
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:21,119
I bet he's just going to keep on saying it

1093
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:27,519
Yeah I think I probably disagree with you but I gather going to be way to ship

1094
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:28,543
Things around

1095
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,591
Disconnect

1096
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:38,271
December 2003 this is still his position that the bath party is being installed in all the powerful

1097
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:40,063
Iraq

1098
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:40,831
Amazing

1099
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:41,855
It's it's

1100
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,647
Very disconnected

1101
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:44,415
Astonishing

1102
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:45,439
Yeah

1103
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:46,463
What what what

1104
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:48,511
13 year old me would have been like

1105
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:52,351
And it goes to show like how little

1106
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:53,375
The audience

1107
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:04,639
Or whatever like that should be glaring month-long thing he's wrong about over and over

1108
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:06,175
Over and over and over and over again

1109
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,199
Consistently

1110
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:08,991
New reality does not penetrate

1111
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:09,759
I mean

1112
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:12,575
It's on the other hand it's not like they are

1113
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:16,671
Necessarily mean nobody in the states at that time was

1114
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,439
Very

1115
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,719
Well-versed in like

1116
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:24,095
Here's how you tell apart the bad party and you know

1117
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:27,423
Yeah but that is the bad part of what are you going to say

1118
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:30,495
