1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Damn important I sweat it

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for its knowledge by knowledge

3
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,832
Stripe.com

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,720
Play Welcome Back to fight knowledge I'm Jordan

5
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:09,120
This is a podcast where we worship at the altar of Selena and do anything but talk about Alex Jones

6
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,400
That's correct

7
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,168
Jordan

8
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,960
Jordan

9
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:22,176
Bright spot today ideas you know I'm going back through all the albums that I may have missed from 2022

10
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:28,576
Year-end lists

11
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,856
Bration from my

12
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:33,696
Annual list of bangers no I did not I did not

13
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:38,304
But BlackSalt and Danger Mouse put out an album

14
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,704
Very very good and not Lisa which is absolutely spectacular

15
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,776
It's produced in such a way that it has that old kind of

16
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:54,432
Grittier feel you know that like will those early mixtape days you know back in the late 80s

17
00:01:54,688 --> 00:02:00,064
Some of those early Roots songs like like

18
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:03,648
2.0

19
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:07,488
Back where it all started

20
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,024
Illadelph half-life

21
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,424
Around

22
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,984
Alright

23
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,384
Leonard up did you have likes

24
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,432
Some albums that you were like

25
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:31,808
Just leave

26
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:38,208
Are you going to be for likely month of January albums do it too

27
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,232
I wanted to listen

28
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:45,888
You know that kind of thing and then I've listened to a lot that I

29
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,424
No I'm grumpy

30
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,728
Alright what's the pop music that reflects

31
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,496
Grumpiness

32
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,520
See

33
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:55,360
This is interesting I'm the king of the Grumps

34
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:59,200
And I kind of like right now. Have solutely yes

35
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:05,600
Maybe something a little bit of Darkness

36
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,368
With that

37
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:12,000
The group Sally Shapiro has a new album out

38
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:18,400
Duo and DJ guy and

39
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:24,288
Kind of melancholy

40
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,568
Take me to albums

41
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,128
Together and then they quit

42
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,920
They were tired and then

43
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:36,320
I didn't realize this but it was recently put out a new album called a sad city is it a little bit

44
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:40,416
Does it have that kind of fun to know enough about Ladytron I can't really

45
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,720
Isn't that something that you recommended to me

46
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,512
A number of times in the past

47
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:49,632
I don't know I don't I don't know how to eventually

48
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:53,984
In the next couple of years we will be right back where we are now would be safe

49
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,384
What does that sound a little bit like Ladytron about a different probably

50
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,968
Today's get around to it I'm not good at taking recommendations

51
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,296
But yeah I've enjoyed that sad City

52
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,320
Album

53
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,112
I will definitely be listening to that

54
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:16,512
11 attala discount

55
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,119
Anthony

56
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,959
Annoys me

57
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:33,919
What up now I can't do it anymore so frustrated today

58
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,223
We do have brought to

59
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,271
I'm going to say this to you

60
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,063
Recently

61
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,855
Things have been very races

62
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,647
Wow

63
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,415
That is true

64
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:49,279
You know like pretty much a Non-Stop drumbeat of somebody being racist on The Daily

65
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,095
Sure right sir and I'm tired

66
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
Of that

67
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,935
It's been going on a lot so I thought let's try and have fun

68
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,215
Without racing

69
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:57,983
Okay

70
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:04,383
Okay that seems anathema to over the course of time doing the butt

71
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:08,223
I think it's an admirable goal right and I think I'm coming

72
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:08,991
Close

73
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,527
At least

74
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,575
On this particular episode

75
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:18,975
It is a show called Dreamland by this guy named Whitley strieber

76
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:25,375
Oh I know him

77
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:31,775
Going on right now

78
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:36,639
And I'm sure I'm sure he's right this somewhere

79
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:43,039
I'm sure he's racist I'm sure he's anti-semitic somewhere but not on this particular episode

80
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:53,279
One of the names of the I remember even from like back in my days of like

81
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,351
Reading the blogs and message boards

82
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,143
Conspiracies

83
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,959
Controversial figure in that if subways

84
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,519
He's never heard of him before

85
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:07,615
And then I looked at it with the interesting about him is that he's a fairly

86
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,175
Successful science fiction and horror author

87
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,247
Right in. John R at school

88
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:19,647
Right and he is also a guy who writes about Bigfoot you know and how like we're going to find

89
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:23,999
Dim sum that you don't like that kind of thing so it's a little bit like if he is Isaac Asimov

90
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,303
Was like I write great science fiction

91
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:31,167
And instead of the rise and fall of the Roman Empire it's like the rise and fall of the far blue viens

92
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:35,775
That kind of thinking maybe it's maybe it's heavily veiled

93
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,055
Fiction

94
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,591
Do you know like maybe it's

95
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,615
Maybe you

96
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:45,759
We're the fools were thinking that we should take what he saying about Bigfoot seriously might just be more science-fiction here's the thing

97
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,575
That's kind of what I'm talking about with his guests

98
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,855
Today interesting

99
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,927
I don't think he's doing that okay

100
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:59,327
Okay it's got the might be brilliant like immersive fiction author

101
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:05,727
Should be an Improv Everywhere. Something and his name is Joshua

102
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,495
Kuchen

103
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,799
Joshua

104
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:12,639
I think before we jump into that I think that Patton Oswalt

105
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:18,783
Had a mention of Whitley strieber in like one of his first album

106
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:23,647
While that was where my brain

107
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,671
Yeah

108
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,207
Which one is that

109
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,023
Might even been in the

110
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:34,143
No not the Robert Evans

111
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,679
B

112
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,727
That was that was coming into comedy

113
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:44,127
Shingles around that area before

114
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:47,967
Three years three or four years before that invited

115
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,831
The famous bowl

116
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:58,463
He is interviewing Joshua kuchen about his new book

117
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,255
Ecology of Souls

118
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,535
Who I am

119
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,583
We're going to get into that

120
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,399
But before we do how about we say hello to

121
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
Resume walk

122
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:11,263
That sounds like a great idea of team stats

123
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,799
You are now a policy wonk

124
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:19,455
Chunky honky-tonk you are now a policy walk

125
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:25,855
I'm opposed to any morricone who is tired of hearing Alex used

126
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,391
Ecstasy of Gold

127
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:30,719
From Good the Bad and the Ugly coming out of Ed brakes

128
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:37,631
You are now

129
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,935
Ennio morricone

130
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,239
It's that whatever

131
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,519
Okay alright

132
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:50,175
We're not going to do that we're not going to do this with your handwriting.

133
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:53,247
God Lennon

You are now a policy was to Linnea Linnea. Jesus Christ learn how to write

We also have a technocrat

141
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:38,559
I'm so sorry I've listened to your entire back catalogue twice

142
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,583
You are now attacking

143
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,607
Crap

144
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,543
Start don't get mad until you're brilliant someone sodomite sent me a bucket of poop

145
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,087
Jesus Christ

146
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:04,671
Very much to all of you

147
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,719
By then so

148
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,279
Today we're talking about this interview on Dreamland

149
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:15,679
The Ecology of souls Ecology of souls Joshua ecologically

150
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,959
I thought you said

151
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,543
Economy of souls at first I thought I got we're going to get some black soul Bank

152
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,079
No it's it's

153
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,127
More of I mean

154
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,151
First off

155
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:25,919
I've read the book

156
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,711
It is

157
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,503
Roughly 300,000 words

158
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,855
I do know you do I can I just have to plan to do this yesterday morning

159
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,135
Sure it is

160
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:41,279
Almost like a like an adventure adventure from like the 40

161
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:45,375
1800 coming back to the club and in Britain being like

162
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,423
People

163
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,007
South are you know what's that

164
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:55,615
Got a vivisection it was sold

165
00:10:55,871 --> 00:11:02,015
And in this region fairies are known for their particular wings

166
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:06,879
Fun at the scripture okay sent an anthropology

167
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:10,719
F*** rules and if it were real

168
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:15,583
This person is so convinced that what he's saying is just more like

169
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,887
Documenting the kingdom phylum

170
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:21,727
Jim versus genie versus you know all of that stuff

171
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:25,823
As it relates to the sort of cataloging and description of Souls

172
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,895
We all knows what the compound noun is of a soul

173
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:34,783
Right I mean you know there's like a murder of crows there's a there's a blessed Union of Souls

174
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,319
No I don't believe this way

175
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:42,975
She likes me for me my God

176
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,791
No it's not the name of that song There's a band

177
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:52,191
Leonardo

178
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,215
One hit wonder by like

179
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,519
Bush no

180
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,591
Bush

181
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,943
Yeah what are those 90 Sum 41 or something like that

182
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,223
Different cattle

183
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,759
They were pop punk

184
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,319
Bush was more like

185
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,903
Just on the end table grun

186
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,767
But like a Jars of Clay version of purple rain rain on my face

187
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:23,167
Grace the flood what's the Stacy's mom one that was founded

188
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,471
That was later just go later

189
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:32,895
Pleasant Union of Souls had the Hey Leonardo to like me for me so I also I believe

190
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,711
Love is the answer I believe

191
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,759
Love find a way

192
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,783
Terrible

193
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,343
Yeah you're well you're not selling me on

194
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:47,743
Hey Leonardo pretty good

195
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,023
He goes into the compound noun

196
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,607
But there are a few threads throughout this interview

197
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:58,495
That are happening at the same time and yet entirely unrelated

198
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,031
Before we get into too much

199
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,311
How about an out-of-context

200
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,079
How about it

201
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,871
Felt like a woman to me

202
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
Okay

203
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,759
I assume he's talking Souls

204
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,527
It's

205
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:14,623
He's a person who that was pulled from the commercial

206
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,183
Which is him under hypnosis

207
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:21,279
Explaining how he was having a sexual encounter

208
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,607
With an alien

209
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,887
It's alright it's just

210
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,679
For me it's just so funny

211
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,703
When he goes

212
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,495
I thought it was a woman

213
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:37,151
Yeah there's a little bit dramatic my favorite

214
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,175
Absolutely

215
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,247
Stop by today were talking about Joshua kuchen

216
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,831
Ecology of Souls and I think stryver introduces him Beth

217
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,111
Go ahead and play that

218
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,695
Britton amazing you book

219
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,463
Cold

220
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,231
Recology

221
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:51,999
Absol

222
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,303
He's the author of

223
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,071
7

224
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,119
Critically acclaimed books

225
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,399
Trojan feast

226
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,191
The food and drink offerings of aliens

227
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,727
Fairies and Sasquatch

228
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,007
Which we have

229
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,287
Talked about

230
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,079
The brimstone.

231
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,663
An in-depth examination of Supernatural

232
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
Sense

233
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,967
Otherworldly

234
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:15,551
Orders and monstrous me asthma's okay

235
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,343
Of the night

236
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,927
History of supernatural child abduction

237
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,975
And where the fruit

238
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,767
Prince and highest range

239
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,535
Kissing a Bigfoot

240
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,303
Phenomenon

241
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,095
All of the

242
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,375
Very cool

243
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,703
All of them loved by you I mean we didn't

244
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,983
Talk about all of them

245
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,263
Once we

246
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,031
We talked about

247
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
Will up by

248
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,335
You loved

249
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,639
I'm cool

250
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,431
People

251
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
Loved

252
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,991
Yeah people loved

253
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:48,319
They didn't talk about all this

254
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:51,391
I don't know what it is about that one title that is just

255
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,951
By the miasma the okay

256
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,999
He was pretty excited

257
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,559
I also was pretty excited

258
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:04,959
Out of all of those books the only one I want to read this one about weird Smith

259
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:09,311
Otherworldly spell show up

260
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:15,711
I don't know that book I could not fight I think olives might be otherworldly is a smell

261
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:19,551
Cuz I love the smell of them that you open a jar of olives

262
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,319
Sure

263
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:26,975
That's otherworldly 2832 which Mandela effect for you

264
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:33,375
Somebody gave you the smell of olives in Another Universe maybe maybe not necessarily Mandela effect

265
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,399
Witchcraft

266
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:37,215
Otherworldly

267
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:37,983
Ripped

268
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:42,335
You know any other smells

269
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:46,175
The world that's it that's a great question maybe like

270
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,247
Fresh cut grass

271
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
That's that's that's

272
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,807
What's the different sets of different

273
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,087
Sure

274
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,535
Fed is petrichor

275
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:05,887
Which is the smell of dirt after rain or something along those lines but

276
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:10,495
It's very very important to Doctor Who friends close to fresh cut grass you know

277
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,775
Both are lawn

278
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
Adjacent

279
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
Pretty much

280
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,895
Absolutely turns out we just want lawn

281
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,111
I think I mean it's impressive anybody who's written

282
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,159
More than one book of nonsense

283
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:31,743
Yeah it's always going to tip my hat to that

284
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,023
This man

285
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,071
Is an impressive writer

286
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,887
In-N-Out in some ways

287
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,679
He is an impressive writer

288
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:43,007
To the point where if he were writing in at

289
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,311
The you if we existed in the universe

290
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,103
Where what he's writing makes sense

291
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,663
He would be like the pop historian

292
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,991
Yeah like Barbara tuchman of imaginary

293
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:59,391
B******* you know what I also want to hear about the food offerings of the fairies and wizards and

294
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,951
2:10

295
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:08,607
Fairly interesting it's got to be like what the food

296
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,143
Springs Arby's stuff like

297
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
Ambrosia

298
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,983
He's he's a classic

299
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:19,103
So everything that he does and the reason that went music Classics you don't mean like

300
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,639
In terms of the Academia

301
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:27,039
Like Greek and Roman history

302
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:33,439
Fairies and the foods they want to series as just like what we

303
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:36,255
Kenzie and fairies or whatever it is you want to go on there

304
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,791
He's talking more like

305
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:44,191
Everything from human history that might resemble a fairy falls under the classification

306
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,215
Fearraiser

307
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,775
Therefore you can go from region to region

308
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:51,871
Almost anthropologically sakes in this area fairies are fed

309
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:55,199
Berries on the table

310
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:59,295
Mary Berry fairy berries is one of my favorite British cooking show

311
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:04,415
He's kind of got that and that's why people love them

312
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,207
In this world is because

313
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,999
Everything he writes

314
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,791
It's is exhaustively

315
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,351
Ridiculously reference

316
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:15,423
His bibliography for the Ecology of Souls

317
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,471
Runs 160 Samad page

318
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,007
Too much

319
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,591
And it's all pretend

320
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,871
What are references

321
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:28,223
Is anywhere from like a scientific paper from the 1800s

322
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,503
To a poem

323
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:33,087
To f****** cave paintings just being like became famous

324
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:38,719
He's proved it I bet it's also like three of those pages or zebit

325
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,487
Exhaustive

326
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,559
Crazy I'm exhausted

327
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:45,887
Strivers starts out the way anybody any good interviewer would

328
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,447
Let's get some background information

329
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,495
This is the start of one of our threads

330
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,543
Which is Strivers interview Style

331
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,823
Okay

332
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,103
Joshua

333
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,407
You spend it all

334
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,943
Where do you ask

335
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,479
From know your

336
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,247
Your

337
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:03,807
Your

338
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,623
Curriculum vitae on your website

339
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,183
Is Joshua coaching.com by the way

340
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,487
Doesn't really tell us much about

341
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,535
Jealous about what you

342
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
Done

343
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,071
But

344
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,607
Tell us more about

345
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,679
Who you are your musician among others

346
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,239
Well I suppose that the

347
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,775
The simplest thing right away is

348
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,335
To see that I'm sitting here in Georgia wearing Wisconsin

349
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,895
Sweatshirt and I'm from North Carolina

350
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,223
Understand exactly

351
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:43,231
Eazy-E funny about it

352
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,815
So you live in places like

353
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:53,471
Whitley did say like where you from non-sequitur answer but

354
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:59,871
It doesn't really tell us much about this person other than he's moved I guess what he's trying to say is like I'm a little from Eva

355
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,663
Everywhere in the South I suppose

356
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,967
But I got that's that's not really answer

357
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:08,063
Latest Wisconsin.

358
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:14,463
I'm having a day North Dakota recent North Carolina

359
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:18,047
Is Georgia Wisconsin North Carolina that's what it was you know what though

360
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,071
Debatably the South

361
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:24,703
Wisconsin North Carolina South Carolina for sure North Carolina

362
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:29,311
Debatable Wisconsin definitely not

363
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:34,175
He's not getting too much information

364
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,479
To give you an idea of what Joshua looks like

365
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,063
He's he's he's a

366
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,343
Pretty large dude

367
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,903
He's six-foot-three he's half

368
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,671
Superman

369
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,207
Pretty bold

370
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,487
With a neckbeard

371
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,511
Psych no

372
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,815
Mustache is all around the neck

373
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:57,471
That's not far off from a look that I might have been pulling it some points in high school

374
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:00,543
It shaved my head periodically and I had an Amish beard

375
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:06,943
You know I had the the tried to connect with my Mennonite roots

376
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,735
You're doing it intentionally but

377
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,759
If you're dunno

378
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,551
Something older person

379
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,111
Well. It's not a problem but it doesn't it's not

380
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,672
Not for a 15 year old

381
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:21,536
Sol will continue on it it'll tell us a little bit more

382
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:25,888
Yes sir so I was I was raised in North Carolina

383
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,168
20 minutes north of Charlotte

384
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,448
And I will

385
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,472
To undergraduate

386
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,496
Go to the university of

387
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,288
For music performer

388
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,336
So I came down to the University of Georgia

389
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:37,408
Where I got a master's in music literature and a master's in

390
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,176
Journalism

391
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:44,320
And you know big cities have a certain gravity and they sort of pull you in overtime so I'm

392
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,624
Getting closer and closer to Atlanta

393
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,648
I might have to get the

394
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,184
A cheap escape velocity at some

395
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,720
Point the right now I'm in the Marietta area

396
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,792
Okay well I didn't tell us much either

397
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,328
Sure

398
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,656
I relate to this visit

399
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:03,264
Whitley's Charming me a little bit

400
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:09,664
He's got a certain style as long as I got to look into either these guys

401
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:16,064
Beyond this episode kind of gaslighting

402
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,832
Graphical stuff

403
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:19,392
Yeah she's either response to the question

404
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,160
It's just like

405
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,184
I don't know

406
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,488
Maybe I'm not charm here's here's what I'm

407
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,536
As far as this goes

408
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,560
I think

409
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,096
What Whitley is looking

410
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,656
Looking for is more of a supernatural aunt

411
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,192
I think I think

412
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,216
It's more

413
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:36,032
Based on what we've heard so far shuttle running about that

414
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,360
It feels more like the where you from is like

415
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,640
It should be

416
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:45,248
Where are you from emotionally where are you from like what's the another your lineage

417
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,552
Through this b******* as opposed to like

418
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,088
Geographical locations

419
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:49,856
You stop that

420
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,672
And how you're afraid you might end up in Atlanta

421
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:59,072
Worse Fates than ending up in Atlanta is better than Atlanta

422
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,888
I've got certain charm I'm not saying it doesn't

423
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:05,728
I'm just saying I don't know I've never been but I've just talkin out of my ass

424
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:13,152
What caught my ear is he is a musician who has a master's in music literature

425
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:16,480
So I wanted to see what was going on

426
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,272
My man please

427
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,552
Booktuber

428
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:25,952
Okay that was not what I expected you were not expecting that cuz this is

429
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,744
These types of shows I was assuming like

430
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,120
He has a master's in Theremin

431
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,280
Tuba solo

432
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:02,816
Wow

433
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:09,728
What you doing the Duke of Earl

434
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:16,128
Do Governor that was one in particular because

435
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:21,504
One is video on YouTube is just a close-up of him and his tuba like right on his face

436
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,784
And then the tuba

437
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,552
And then attached

438
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:28,416
The tuba is a cup holder with a full beer in hell yeah

439
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,952
I do

440
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,232
The whole performance

441
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:34,816
Is there everybody in the band gets their own solo and that's why I

442
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:38,912
Play that audio just a little bit beforehand because you want to come to his solo

443
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:45,312
He went into the audio on the video cut it out and added it so he could be and I respect that

444
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:49,920
This might also answer the question of the namaste

445
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:54,016
Mouthpiece Chafin can be difficult on a tuba

446
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:59,392
You know you're not wrong I had not considered that I played a French horn and I remember

447
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,160
They're being

448
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:00,928
Difficulties

449
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:06,048
I had not considered that that's a good point.

450
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:12,448
Yeah anyways this through the marching band nerd if I ever heard one. Seems like it's tough to play the tuba and not be

451
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:18,848
Again I feel like I'm fairly confident we're not in racist territory here I don't know why

452
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:19,872
But I feel like

453
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,176
You can't be a racist tuba player

454
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:28,576
You can't be in a band playing the tuba and being racist at the same mileage Italy have no counter

455
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:31,904
Examples but I strongly disagree with you

456
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,024
I think it wouldn't be too hard to find a racing tuba player the clan has tuba players

457
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,792
That's fair

458
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,560
You're right

459
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:41,632
I don't think they're tuba players in the soul that they can't like

460
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,984
It's tough to play the tuba with a hood

461
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,592
Mouthpiece

462
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:58,016
Oacac so anyways scriber is going to is going to continue his investigation

463
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:02,368
Navigation here and he's going to keep telling us a little bit more about his background a Joshua and where he comes

464
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,160
What the heck

465
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:04,928
Heck

466
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:07,488
Are you doing writing things about

467
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,608
A new mythology of death and the Paranormal for example

468
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:16,448
I didn't hear anything in any of this

469
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,752
Tells me why you do what

470
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:21,568
What you do normally that you're brilliant

471
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,592
I mean these books are

472
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,616
Phenomenal

473
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:28,224
Wet Willie's telling on himself never been to Wisconsin

474
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:33,856
Everyone there is it to the new ideology of death

475
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,136
Yep yep

476
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:39,232
That is what your college visits a new mythology of death

477
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,256
Interesting

478
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,024
Yep that's

479
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,632
Pretty heady now another reason why stryver might think he is very very brilliant

480
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,936
Because Schreiber is referenced a lot

481
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:52,032
Okay yeah

482
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:58,432
Quite a good way to go to good review

483
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:00,992
Especially the part where I've been in a bunch

484
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:05,088
I think you hear why I love

485
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,440
Strivers interview-style just so just

486
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,464
The heck

487
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,864
Are you doing how's the feeling of being rude and less their friends and that makes you assume that their friends when they

488
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:23,264
They may not be so high in the weird

489
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,032
Community

490
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:30,688
Feel like you can pull whatever s*** you want to just says whatever he's thinking

491
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,992
Also you got to be pretty old

492
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:39,392
Oh he's burial yeah cuz I thought he would be dead yeah yeah he's very very old

493
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,184
The 90s quite frankly

494
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:44,768
Like an art bell type

495
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,328
I can't remember when that was maybe there

496
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:53,216
But that that's well I mean also that's why his his questions take a little bit longer to to get going

497
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:59,104
Is it takes a while for the bolts are rolling down the hill

498
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,920
What's going on in this book is it the little bit like

499
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,504
John Hodgman book you remember

500
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,576
Do that.

501
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:14,208
Unlike that feed the hobo signs

502
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,256
Right

503
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:19,584
It's a little bit like that but if John Hodgman was telling you

504
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,608
Confidently

505
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,632
This is a

506
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,400
Real

507
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,936
Buckeye am describing to

508
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,264
Keep going on

509
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,544
Go ahead play the neck

510
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,360
That's very kind of you I guess

511
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,384
Shy but he knows

512
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:37,248
Just kept on wanting to interject that I guess I read to me

513
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,016
Show me books by this

514
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:38,784
Streamer guy

515
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,576
That sort of put me off on this path

516
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:43,392
Oh I'm a real

517
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,440
Torn in the side

518
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,744
Of the ordinary world

519
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,024
I don't belong here

520
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,328
Well I think you're right about

521
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,608
You don't belong here

522
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,448
Yeah the cracks unlocked

523
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,216
Correct

524
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,544
Where are we in

525
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,824
I'm here

526
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,944
What's glitches jump in

527
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,784
There's a lot of

528
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:11,808
Cool stuff

529
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,832
In this book about

530
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:13,856
Fairy

531
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:14,880
Folks

532
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,160
The ecologist

533
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,696
So we're going to talk about

534
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:21,024
This is huge idea a new mythology of death

535
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,048
Asuna paranormal

536
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,072
Over the course

537
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,352
Because that's the

538
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,144
TitleBucks over the course of the interview

539
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,680
But let's talk first

540
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,960
What about the series

541
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:29,984
Oh

542
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,264
The others

543
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,568
No I mean

544
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,616
I've had them around in my life

545
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:36,640
My wife

546
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,408
Lot of my list

547
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,432
Have to

548
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,456
Why do people have

549
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:47,392
I looked it up during the eclipse he's only 77

550
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:53,792
Really I thought he would be older than 90 days

551
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,584
You see him if you look at him

552
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,656
He looks great for 77

553
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,680
Sure

554
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:02,496
No I mean he looks great for

555
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:05,056
He looks very bad 475

556
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:10,944
I got that wrong he looks very bad for 7790

557
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,992
Weird

558
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:17,344
It's a strange thing where you have like these people slotted into various places in your brain

559
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,368
And like I was

560
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,696
Iodine ooh that name and I was almost certain

561
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,744
He was ancient yeah

562
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,792
Yeah it is it is like stuff

563
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:31,680
It's old when you're young as you get older seems twice as old as it was you no like

564
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:38,080
If it if your dad Reddit you know even he was only thirty years older than you you feel like it was a hundred years the same time

565
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,616
I mean Barbara Walters just passed

566
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:43,712
She was in her 90s

567
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:50,880
I think our what we're describing is that we don't know how old AJ individual celebrity may or may not be

568
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:53,184
I need to make flashcards

569
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,768
We need to practice on this we got a Verizon all this stuff

570
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,560
So the fairy folk are involved

571
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:04,960
Yep yep yep easystart about the fairies I mean I'll say he starts a chapter like

572
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,984
I guess with this sentence

573
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,056
There are also physical fairy doubles

574
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,080
Whoa

575
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,384
. isn't that something

576
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,152
That you

577
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:15,200
You can visit

578
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,760
First sentence that's a great person

579
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:22,112
8 using also in the first

580
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,928
Sentence of a chapter probably go

581
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,208
What is a

582
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,864
Physical is it like okay so I'm guessing that fairies are not physical beings are kind of ethereal

583
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,400
Ghost like

584
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:36,448
Creatures or something and then

585
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,240
There are also doubles

586
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:40,544
They can take physical form

587
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,592
Or do only some take physical form

588
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,128
I mean

589
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,152
Cut you off

590
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:47,456
Too many questions Papa

591
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,504
There are also fairy double

592
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,808
The also refers to

593
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,344
There are human doubles

594
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,624
There are

595
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,440
There's space doubles there are there's just doubles of everything

596
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:59,488
How else you can play

597
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:02,048
So there's two things that exist side-by-side

598
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:05,376
Is it weighs what he tries to to get through with his

599
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,400
Is is main fees

600
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,496
Let me do that just mean twins a little bitty

601
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,800
But like who do

602
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,360
It's a little bit like parallel universe kind of stuff

603
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:18,176
You know you got another one of you

604
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:22,528
In another universe that we can never access and may not be

605
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,808
Okay but you can't see

606
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,136
But if you're in that universe

607
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,416
That he lives in

608
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,184
Then you got

609
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,512
Where you from

610
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:35,840
I'm wearing a t-shirt from Wisconsin

611
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:42,240
So what coaching is doing is trying to create a grand field theory of pretend

612
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,776
Trying to

613
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,824
And what he does is he

614
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,616
He takes from everything

615
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,384
And I mean

616
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,664
Everything he can

617
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,456
He he pulls from

618
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:53,248
You know Greek mythology

619
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,272
Peoples from

620
00:32:54,528 --> 00:33:00,416
AAA did the Christianity abrahamic religion kind of thing he pulls from Eastern philosophy

621
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:04,256
And he's trying to put all of this stuff together into one thing

622
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,792
Right that's not going to work

623
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,560
It stuffed

624
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,328
To do

625
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,888
I guess I just know

626
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,448
This has been tried before

627
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:17,568
Well doesn't work

628
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,128
Yeah go ahead and keep going

629
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
Mastiff

630
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,248
Frankly I mean

631
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:26,528
It's a

632
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:27,808
Really something

633
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,368
Thank you so much

634
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,392
It's sort of

635
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,416
It sort of evolved

636
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,440
Into a snapshot

637
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,464
Highlights

638
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,232
I think about these

639
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,280
Make them all sit together

640
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,560
Because I am in a lot of ways

641
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,120
Pan paranormalist

642
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,400
Like that I want to see

643
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,936
See how the Fairy stuff.

644
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:44,960
It's in with the cryptic

645
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,728
Good stuff and I will

646
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,264
You sit into the

647
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,544
Do your folks

648
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,384
Eddie Bullard

649
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,408
He drew a lot of similarity

650
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,968
The UFO contact

651
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,248
You got

652
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,808
Kenneth ring obviously whom you work with quite a bit

653
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,368
Experience

654
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,648
Contact

655
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:07,488
It just seems like every contact modality

656
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,512
We has the Fest

657
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,816
Of the same shared at

658
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,120
Regardless of where it is so

659
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,912
How many makes a good point

660
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:18,496
Bananas much as like if we're all going to do all this pretend

661
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,264
Stop

662
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,056
We're going to have all these ideas

663
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:23,616
Back to have to exist in the same unit

664
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:27,712
You know like so that what is it is there something

665
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,016
That supervenes upon ghost

666
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,576
And fairies and squat

667
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,856
And all this

668
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:36,160
Is there some kind of a like

669
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:39,488
Unknown Universe law or something

670
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:43,328
That explains this kind of stuff would have to be

671
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:47,936
Right he's easy with crazy about him picture think

672
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:52,032
What's crazy about knowing I read his book what's crazy about him is that he's kind of

673
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,312
Got a good

674
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,592
Thought process

675
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,664
In insofar as where he's trying to take the

676
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,480
His is philosophy is this

677
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,528
Something along the lines of

678
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,600
If any of these religions are true

679
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:06,624
Right

680
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,184
Then there's a chance that any of them are

681
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,232
Sure so

682
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,024
Either they're all true

683
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,816
Or all possibly true

684
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,096
Or none of them

685
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,912
Because if a religion is possible

686
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,192
If magic is pause

687
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,240
Possible then all bets are off

688
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,008
All magic

689
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:25,056
Is possible

690
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:30,432
It's itsy it seems like if there is one magician

691
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,480
There is potentially you talk

692
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,760
Exactly

693
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,552
At the same time

694
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,832
If there's one magician

695
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,136
It's possible there's only one magician

696
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,416
But he

697
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,440
He saying

698
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,632
Thought I don't

699
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,424
For see him coming to any

700
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,984
Good conclusions necessarily but

701
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,032
I I think it's it's an interesting

702
00:35:57,056 --> 00:36:02,688
Well what's it what are the conclusion that it comes to is it going to after he goes through all of his talk

703
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:06,016
Where is URI would look through all of this and see like

704
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,552
Okay well you see this

705
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,600
This isn't real we prove that that's not

706
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:10,624
Listening

707
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,720
We proved that's not really proved all up so much of this s*** is real

708
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:18,048
So by your line of thought I'm just going to go ahead and say

709
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,072
But none of it

710
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,096
Right

711
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,120
And he goes

712
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,656
You can't prove it

713
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,704
The doll real

714
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:29,312
Yeah that's a problem problem

715
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,848
On the other hand though

716
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,152
It's so well-researched

717
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,688
It's so

718
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:37,504
Janja and let me try and give you an idea of

719
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,576
Some of the things that I'll do he does a couple of academic trick

720
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,856
Which are fun

721
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,672
Well uses big words I heard that already

722
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:46,720
That's one of the big ones of course but

723
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:49,024
He uses his references

724
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,048
Very deceptive

725
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,864
So I'll give you a tall man

726
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,144
Listen to this

727
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,912
Overwrought

728
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,520
Typically red-eyed from her continual crying

729
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:04,128
The Banshee appears as a woman with long hair in a green dress under a grey cloud

730
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,432
The others Cloud her and white

731
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,480
The color of bloodless corpse as

732
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,248
And ghosts

733
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,552
Or Greek spirits who appeared pallid

734
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,344
Because they were deprived of the Sun

735
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,648
She loves brushing her hair and is considered

736
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:18,208
Very dangerous even today to pick up a

737
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,232
Straight comb

738
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,536
You find laying on the ground in case it belongs

739
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:22,560
The fairy woman

740
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:26,144
The Banshee fairy woman who's crying all the time

741
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,448
Remember just leaving friend

742
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,240
He's got

743
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,008
3 quotes

744
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,056
M3 references

745
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:33,824
For those quotes

746
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,616
Ch1 has their own referee

747
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,688
Now what are the references comes after

748
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,224
What are the

749
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,272
Citation citations comes after

750
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:44,576
Cloud in Cloud her in white

751
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,672
The color of bloodless corpses in ghosts

752
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,696
Is a

753
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,976
Citation from that

754
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:53,280
But it makes it look

755
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,584
Visually like he's sighting

756
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,888
The typically red-eyed from her

757
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:04,288
Continual crying the Banshee appears line making it sound like he's backed up the most insane part of that

758
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:07,104
He's always crying

759
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,920
And that she's always crying all of these things are crazy

760
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:14,272
Referencing a different way of describing something as what

761
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,392
Oh wait what is with the citation is like 2 at the Souris Houston

762
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:24,000
The it's just the the cloud her in white part that's no good

763
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,560
I do I do think

764
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,096
Okay so just

765
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:28,864
From

766
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,656
The perspective

767
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:33,728
I don't know I feel like that that description of a banshee does

768
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,008
Does the Banshee dirty

769
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,288
A little bit

770
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:42,688
Well you saw there's for descriptions of a banshee in that one thing but they're all accurate

771
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,712
Exactly

772
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,992
Problem

773
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:47,296
If one of them's real they're all real

774
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,088
Sometimes red sometimes White

775
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:49,856
Dressed

776
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:54,976
Always crying Greek to brush hair

777
00:38:55,232 --> 00:39:01,120
Pick up a comb are in one paragraph that has multiple citation

778
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:03,936
Two things that have nothing to do with proving that it's

779
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:07,520
Is the advice that like if you see a comb don't touch it

780
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,568
Guess it's good advice

781
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,592
Sure

782
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,152
The weird part is the to this day like

783
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,176
Hey man

784
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,456
To this day that's

785
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:17,760
It's still real like we haven't aged out of

786
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,832
No not like not like being like

787
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:26,976
This belief still persists to this day I thought the Banshee was like yelled and hurt you with noise

788
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,024
Well that's one type of Banshee

789
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,072
From this region

790
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:34,400
The Banshees are well known for their Bubba

791
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:41,824
I thought that was like the defining characteristic that's the one thing people know about

792
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,128
Maybe that's because of the Marvel character banshee

793
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,152
Well I could babe

794
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:51,808
I feel like man she is a fairly young like a banshee is kind of a expression

795
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:58,208
Users manual

796
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,744
What color clothes

797
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,840
Does Banshee have in the gygax manual

798
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:04,608
Tattered

799
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:09,472
Tell Josh color is a standardized

800
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,752
But the tatters are

801
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:13,056
So nice you crying

802
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:17,664
What did you do

803
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,200
See that's what I want

804
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:23,552
Well that depends on what's wrong

805
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:28,928
We all share the blame so we get into twin tracks here

806
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:32,256
This is where coaching and streever kind of

807
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:34,048
Start

808
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,096
Branching on separate pathways

809
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:38,144
Alright Cutchins going to start talking

810
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:38,912
King about his book

811
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,472
Schreiber has

812
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,288
Described as a story to

813
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:48,128
So I think you're going to see these start to play out over this next couple

814
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,432
The afterlife is it

815
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,456
Some sort of

816
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:53,248
Realm where time is

817
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,272
Is held in stasis

818
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,832
Skip to be amongst everyone is passed on

819
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:59,392
Their ideas in older cosmology

820
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,160
Especially from

821
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,232
Imperial China

822
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,768
That the afterlife

823
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:05,792
Was again

824
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:06,560
I'm mirror

825
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:07,584
Version of

826
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,608
This world where

827
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,144
You know according

828
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,984
To that you would have to get up and work and there might be

829
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,264
Technological process

830
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,056
What happens on the other side of this failed

831
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,080
This is their technological

832
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:18,848
Process

833
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:21,664
The technological progress that happens on this side

834
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:22,944
About as well

835
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,224
Egyptian farmers

836
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:29,088
We'll have to get up and plow their fields and worship all the same gods and basically life

837
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,112
Continue

838
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,392
So once you take

839
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,160
That little

840
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,440
Tidbit of information and

841
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,208
Frame it within

842
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:34,976
Some

843
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,256
Speculation

844
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,280
Ufology

845
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,048
It's been around for quite

846
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:38,816
Sometime

847
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:39,840
This is literally after

848
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,864
Life technology

849
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,144
It starts

850
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,680
To get really bizarre

851
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,448
That sucks

852
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,472
Yep

853
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:47,264
Three bums me out

854
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,360
If there is like an afterlife that is eternal and you still have to have a job

855
00:41:55,199 --> 00:42:01,343
I mean I like podcasting I enjoy this but I still don't do this for absolutely I have no idea

856
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,623
Why everybody wants eternity

857
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,743
There's no end to it

858
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,279
Now what that did

859
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:12,351
Is that got stryver a little bit excited

860
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:17,215
Because he started talking about technology from the other side from the after

861
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:20,031
Okay like a like a rake

862
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:23,103
Right or a sickle for the farmer

863
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,127
A little bit different

864
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:24,895
Because

865
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:27,967
Stryver is fairly convinced that his

866
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,991
Cochlear

867
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:30,527
Was

868
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:34,623
Brought over from the other side it is technology

869
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,903
From the deadline

870
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,927
Does make sense

871
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:39,231
And he is going to start telling us a little bit about

872
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:41,023
Okay okay this

873
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:44,095
Sounds good

874
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,399
Well I think it must be

875
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,471
I was certainly

876
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,495
Convinced

877
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:51,775
That

878
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:52,799
That

879
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,335
That was

880
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,639
Exactly I mean that's what he said

881
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,919
But the man said

882
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,735
Fascinating about that man

883
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,271
And folks

884
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,551
Those of you who don't know the

885
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:04,319
Story

886
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:11,231
I have an email to Mike this is a this is a long clip so you can cut in at anytime this story on Glisan

887
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:11,999
Bisturi

888
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:12,767
Meander

889
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:18,399
That makes it all the more important for me to pay attention cuz I got a track

890
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:20,447
These are dumb talk and enjoy it

891
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,983
Also

892
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:28,639
Don't you have some experience of the world of cochlear type of implants and hearing aids

893
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:35,039
Are you sure I'm positive 100% sure they have not been brought over from the other side I mean you were involved

894
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:40,159
That industry this makes it sounds like a cover-up honestly I was in the hearing aid

895
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:43,999
Part I wasn't in the cochlear implant part so I only know that hearing aids

896
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,535
Thoroughly EarthBound

897
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:51,935
See you do you have any grounds tacos

898
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,007
There was a doctor

899
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,543
Who's King 2

900
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:00,127
Get it X-rayed and he was on his way to

901
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,175
Asking me to get it removed

902
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:05,759
Are there was a removal attempt years ago

903
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:06,783
Rafael Fortune

904
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:11,135
But in any case I wasn't going to get it removed but whoever was

905
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,159
Involved with

906
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:12,927
It did not miss

907
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:13,695
Necessarily

908
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:14,719
Real quick

909
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:17,279
When he says it is it like a tumor or something

910
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,071
Just a cochlear implant

911
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:27,007
Coco I didn't know what the it was in the other side

912
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,799
Baby more nutrients

913
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:29,567
Force

914
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,615
Let me put it that way

915
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,407
So couple of nights

916
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,175
For the

917
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,199
PET scan

918
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:35,967
Was

919
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,015
Set up

920
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,319
I had a

921
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,111
Visit

922
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:42,879
From

923
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:45,439
Two men one of whom I know

924
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,231
And I say I know him

925
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,255
I've seen him through four

926
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:49,791
In my life I've seen him

927
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,095
I've seen him

928
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,399
I had seen him

929
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,935
But I went I went out

930
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:56,703
2

931
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,239
The desert one night

932
00:44:59,007 --> 00:44:59,519
Ben just

933
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,055
Time completely alone out in the

934
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,103
And then I've seen

935
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,127
This additional

936
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:07,967
And he proceeded to explain it all.

937
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:08,991
And

938
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,783
To explain the

939
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,319
17 Rod of a story and ever

940
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,855
Everything then said that is based

941
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,623
Chiclets

942
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,391
Had been

943
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,671
Its technology is

944
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,695
Joshua's just said

945
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:18,975
Other side

946
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,255
But he wasn't in

947
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:22,815
The man

948
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:24,607
Is

949
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:25,375
Identical

950
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,447
To a man I know well

951
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,215
In what

952
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,775
Who has no

953
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,311
Idea

954
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,591
I'm going to tell

955
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,615
In fact we're can I have

956
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,895
Have lunch later later

957
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:37,663
Today

958
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:38,687
And I'm going to

959
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:39,967
Story for the first

960
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,991
He's going to love it

961
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:41,759
Keanu

962
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:45,599
Is I love the story I'm sorry

963
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,367
Stupid

964
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,903
One of the strangest things

965
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:48,927
You said his ever

966
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,975
In my life and in his

967
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,559
I had a second do about it though

968
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:56,095
He's never heard the story

969
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,375
Years and years

970
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:58,399
I don't have those

971
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:00,703
I'm not the

972
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:06,079
There was in the rumors

973
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:06,847
Spilled people

974
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,127
Room in the cabin

975
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:09,663
Spelled with p

976
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,455
One of whom I knew

977
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:13,759
And

978
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:14,783
He was in italics

979
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,063
Through my

980
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,087
For a long time

981
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,135
And

982
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,463
File better way

983
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,911
Think anything more but I never told a soul

984
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:31,679
The name

985
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,471
Not my wife not any

986
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:34,495
I've never

987
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,263
Spoken it

988
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:37,823
Fast forward

989
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,591
30

990
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,359
Years

991
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,895
No I won't

992
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,455
Justin talking about

993
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,735
The normal human

994
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:45,503
Part of it

995
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,295
And

996
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,831
He proceeded to tell me

997
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:49,855
Of

998
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:50,879
Kiss encounter

999
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:51,647
Experience which

1000
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:52,927
Total blackness

1001
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,743
He doesn't remember anything about it except

1002
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:56,767
It happened

1003
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,303
And he was reading it

1004
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,935
I met him when he was a boy to our a version

1005
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:05,727
And

1006
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:06,751
He came away from

1007
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:07,775
Experience

1008
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,079
He said with only one

1009
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:10,847
Sing

1010
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:14,175
He had been remembered if you've been told underlined

1011
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,991
In a detective novel

1012
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,807
And he was told that this

1013
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:20,575
Person

1014
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:21,599
Newsom

1015
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,903
Did he have been

1016
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,671
Told

1017
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:25,695
Never

1018
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:27,487
Does switch

1019
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:28,511
With anybody

1020
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:29,535
Heifer

1021
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,583
The name

1022
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,607
Ended

1023
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,375
Active now

1024
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,167
What's the

1025
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,447
The guy

1026
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:38,239
Witnessed that

1027
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:39,007
Sexually

1028
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:50,271
You're so ready to respond you are not ready for the kicker I will sleep for about the last minute

1029
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:56,671
Go back to where people can't see this but I was waiting a pen in the air haha

1030
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,975
You really hit me at the end tonight

1031
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:01,023
Now I don't know what's going on

1032
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:06,655
Because here's what I was thinking I was like I get it I get it when I get

1033
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:13,055
This guy is like he's he saw this guy as a kid because

1034
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,847
He the other guy the kid

1035
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:17,407
Wright was having a visitation from Alien

1036
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:19,199
And all he had was blackness

1037
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:21,759
He doesn't know anything and that was because

1038
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,551
The aliens were using him

1039
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,087
To visit Whitley

1040
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:31,487
I got it you got the story then the sexual encounter in the name

1041
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:36,607
Detective book I kind of lost track of time

1042
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:44,031
The Only Name Penny underlined in the book Hercule Poirot

1043
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:47,615
Witness

1044
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:49,407
My sexual encounter with the other

1045
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:54,527
Oh my God

1046
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:56,319
Unknown

1047
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:59,135
This is part of the story that he's told

1048
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:01,695
Plenty of times you must have butt for me

1049
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:03,487
I enjoyed the mystery

1050
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:06,047
I'm trying to put together

1051
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:08,351
The whole the totality of

1052
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:12,703
So he's been visited by this person

1053
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:13,471
The three times

1054
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:19,871
Cindy's life and this person looks identical to somebody that he knows and is real

1055
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:20,895
Life who he's going to have lunch

1056
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,199
And Lisa Kai

1057
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:29,599
It when he was a kid had a visitation is all just darkness because he's body

1058
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:35,999
He was being used to visit Whitley fast forward 30 years now this guy had underlined

1059
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:38,303
Find a name a detective book

1060
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,143
Because it was the name of somebody who would watch the Whitley f****** jokes

1061
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,423
That is correct

1062
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:47,007
That is the story talk about this

1063
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:50,335
Let's let's hear touch of the responses

1064
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,615
Okay

1065
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:53,407
It seems like quite a challenge

1066
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:57,759
Yes

1067
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:02,623
The forest that says okay that's the one that makes the most sense

1068
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:05,439
Say more words but that's what that's

1069
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:09,279
It's like these little

1070
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:10,815
Mystery box

1071
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,095
As developed

1072
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,935
Send sis a hoping you'll tell me a little bit about

1073
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:17,215
The relationship

1074
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:18,239
Between

1075
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:20,031
The guy who I know it

1076
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:20,799
Absol

1077
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,335
No idea

1078
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,615
Of any of the

1079
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:25,151
The other meetings iPad

1080
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:27,199
Giamarese doppelganger whatever

1081
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,223
What are the

1082
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:28,991
What is going on

1083
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,063
Really really

1084
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:35,135
It does not relate to his book whatsoever

1085
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:37,183
But if his book is like this

1086
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:38,207
Sort of

1087
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:39,999
Pan idea of

1088
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:40,767
Then it does

1089
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,815
Everything relationship

1090
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:46,399
That's the problem

1091
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:52,799
Stuff inside of stuff. This is what I'm supposed to be here for it

1092
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:59,199
Just like this guy who I know in the real world have blackmail on me from what

1093
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:05,599
Read about him having the Leverage

1094
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:13,023
Oh yeah and I mean it is going to go on strike

1095
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:15,071
Focus again this is another log clips

1096
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:17,631
Stop whatever you want but I'm glad

1097
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,679
For it though cuz I I do need contacts

1098
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,447
No

1099
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:22,495
Often been tied

1100
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,287
All manner of

1101
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:25,823
Phenomenon

1102
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:26,591
And

1103
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,383
Seems like something like that might

1104
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,151
Maybe what

1105
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:29,919
What's going on with that

1106
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:30,943
Scenario that you outline

1107
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:32,223
What's the part of this

1108
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,247
Schedule

1109
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,527
Maybe even this place

1110
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:35,807
Time Fraulein

1111
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:36,831
Because I think that

1112
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:37,855
What time place unsworth

1113
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,415
Part of the

1114
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:42,719
Visual was able to sort of wander off on a

1115
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,487
What's up

1116
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:44,511
Obtain

1117
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:45,279
Information

1118
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:51,423
I don't know when I first saw him he was a

1119
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,191
The boy

1120
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,727
He was about 13

1121
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,263
I

1122
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,055
Encountered him at a baseball game

1123
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:58,847
And

1124
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,127
He was sitting

1125
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,151
With

1126
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,711
A gentleman from the

1127
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:04,479
Defense

1128
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,503
Whom are you

1129
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,551
Who hit her face

1130
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:08,831
The Tall Blond

1131
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,391
Ledge

1132
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:13,695
And it in

1133
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:16,255
Out in Boulder

1134
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,023
Colorado

1135
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:20,095
They're gone now they're not there anymore and that's also

1136
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,375
Shutdown

1137
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,399
Very active

1138
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:25,727
And I was rather surprised to see him

1139
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:29,567
And I assume is with three children then I assume these children

1140
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:30,335
Or something

1141
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,615
Special because he wouldn't

1142
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:32,639
The Ben with the mother

1143
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,199
And it was quite clear after

1144
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,223
Couple of

1145
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:36,991
Moments

1146
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,527
The baseball game

1147
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,063
Seemingly

1148
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,087
Brandon

1149
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,111
Ticketed

1150
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,135
Sitting beside them

1151
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,159
It was nothing random

1152
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,183
I'm about it I'm sure

1153
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:47,487
They could read my mind

1154
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,535
They were good breeders

1155
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:52,607
And I so I figured whatever

1156
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,631
Is going on here

1157
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,215
I don't want to

1158
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,239
Interface

1159
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,007
Kim director

1160
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:00,799
All kinds

1161
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:01,567
The problems that

1162
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:02,335
I'm with the

1163
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,103
The greatest

1164
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:05,407
Compliance

1165
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:06,687
Are you cannot imagine

1166
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:08,735
Believe me

1167
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,271
It's a it's a path

1168
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:12,575
You don't want to go down if you're

1169
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:15,903
Deeply enmeshed

1170
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,183
Siam

1171
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,511
I didn't say anything

1172
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,791
Left after

1173
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:22,815
Loyal

1174
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,351
But boy

1175
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:27,167
You talk out here about

1176
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,191
Fairy birth

1177
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:29,983
Hairy Birds

1178
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:36,127
I don't want to call it a talent but a pension

1179
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:39,199
For switching topics train tracks

1180
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,759
That story didn't help me

1181
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:45,599
I'll be honest I mean from what I can take away from that store

1182
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,135
Here's what's going on

1183
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:47,903
Alright

1184
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:49,439
He went to a baseball game

1185
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:52,255
And this guy was sitting next to him with his kids

1186
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:58,911
And his kids that the guy's kids were talking to him and it sounded like they knew exactly what he was thinking good readers

1187
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:04,799
Grade level because their dad

1188
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:11,199
Is allied with the tall blonde people right and he's with the graves you don't want to be

1189
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,903
They're still there

1190
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:20,671
The

1191
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:23,999
Fight you know they can still be friendly enough to watch a baseball game in silence

1192
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:24,767
What

1193
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,303
Is he

1194
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,351
Cuz I

1195
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,887
I assumed

1196
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:33,471
That this guy who is in at lunch within himself wherever similar age

1197
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:37,567
It's right and so he would be a kid at that point to right right

1198
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:42,687
So why is he why does he know the dod agent

1199
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:44,735
Who's talking to the kid

1200
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:46,783
If he himself if wheatly himself as a

1201
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,831
See now that's a problem that I'm having

1202
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:55,743
Maybe he's an adult maybe he's a butt bit older than this lunch partner

1203
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:57,023
I think he's either

1204
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:59,071
In this situation he's an old man

1205
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,095
Himself

1206
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:02,399
Like this is like in the past couple years or so

1207
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,423
This story

1208
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:07,775
So he's still in his mid-seventies and this friend is like

1209
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:08,543
50 there's

1210
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:10,591
Write up as a kid

1211
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:16,991
Well that's when he saw him in his dreams as a kid look like as a kid

1212
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:22,879
I don't know what you look like as a kid

1213
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,159
Yep

1214
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:28,767
Idaho ZIP code

1215
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:30,815
This is this next part is just money I

1216
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:32,095
I just love this bar

1217
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:32,863
Okay

1218
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:34,655
Oh

1219
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,423
Another thing

1220
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:36,703
Wanted to ask

1221
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:37,727
You so badly is

1222
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,007
Crazy

1223
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,287
The fairies

1224
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,567
Converse

1225
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:43,103
There adverse

1226
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,127
Iron

1227
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:45,663
My cab

1228
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,455
Over

1229
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,735
What are the largest

1230
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,271
Themes of iron

1231
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,295
Planet Earth

1232
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,343
The Iron Mountain

1233
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,647
Record storage facility

1234
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:57,439
Is drilled into it about

1235
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,975
20 miles north of the

1236
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,303
Magnetic

1237
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,375
Yeah it's it's interesting because

1238
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:07,167
I think that

1239
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:08,959
The only thing I say

1240
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:09,727
Thank you

1241
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:11,007
Ferry and Ferrum

1242
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:13,567
You have the Latin word for iron

1243
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:16,895
That's kind of what I'm thinking is at play here

1244
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:19,199
What's what's funny to me is

1245
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:20,223
That was not a class

1246
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:26,879
Just telling him that he was not a bunch of hired who is opening up for the question of what's the deal

1247
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:29,439
With fairies being advertised verse 2

1248
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:31,999
Ironhide I mean I don't know if he is

1249
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:38,655
I think he's I think he might be asking if fairies will still come to his place if he lived on top of all this iron

1250
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:40,447
I would say not

1251
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,727
The available information

1252
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,543
Steer clear of Iron Mountain

1253
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:46,335
It must be

1254
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:47,615
It is just

1255
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:48,895
Ferrum though

1256
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:54,783
I mean like that's just what that's the whole thing that's going on in similar

1257
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:57,087
Yep that's that's pretty much it

1258
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,367
Yep

1259
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:04,767
Something we know and love about Alex is his ability to go to add brakes

1260
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:06,303
Let's see how Whitley

1261
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,071
Compares to that

1262
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:10,399
Well I feel like I was brought here to do a job in

1263
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:13,215
It never occurred to anyone involved

1264
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:15,263
Vacation song

1265
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:16,543
You're awesome

1266
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,847
I forgot the first race

1267
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:19,615
Completely you'll be

1268
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:21,919
Be delighted to know free dreamlanders

1269
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:25,503
So I might blast you more with the little of banners

1270
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:26,527
Sayang-2

Please subscribe

1272
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:29,599
She will not do

1273
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:30,879
But that's okay

1274
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:34,463
Here let's do a break now here's this year's a break

1275
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:35,743
Probably be the only break

1276
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:36,767
In the shoulder

1277
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:37,535
Okay

1278
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:38,303
Here we go

1279
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:42,399
Read reminders goodbye for a few minutes watch these

1280
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:45,727
Will be back with Joshua kuchen

1281
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,263
The Ecology of

1282
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,311
His website is Josh

1283
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:50,847
.

1284
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:56,479
I think he's depressed

1285
00:57:56,991 --> 00:58:00,575
Stripers not doing well

1286
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:03,135
Sad

1287
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:04,159
Which you want

1288
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:05,439
Do right

1289
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:11,583
Certainly not now thinking about it

1290
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:14,655
I'll put the thing up to tell you to subscribe but you're not

1291
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:18,751
Palliative care

1292
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:21,823
The weirdest thing is that I saw a child

1293
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,151
Who was Whitley and he told me 6.

1294
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:30,783
30 years later

1295
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:37,439
That's the part that you just can't ever get best that's the end of that story

1296
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:43,839
This is the break is just a commercial for his you know documentary about how he was under automatic writing

1297
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:46,655
Eating hypnosis kind of thing sure he's telling this story

1298
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:50,239
Of how he had sex with an alien or whatever it is

1299
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:54,335
That seems really primary much bigger

1300
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:59,455
What kind about it is it's just sleep or else it's so obviously just

1301
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:05,855
Sleep paralysis even just going through like the symptoms of pressure on the chest

1302

I sure felt

1340
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,447
While I was reading

1341
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:27,007
So get communion

1342
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:28,543

01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,079
Read it

1344
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:32,383
Communion

1345
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:33,663
Is Centrelink

1346
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:34,431
Importance

1347
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,711
All of our lives

1348
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:41,855
We're talking to Joshua cut York

1349
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:46,463
No I think it wasn't I heard the audio change a tiny bit

1350
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:49,535
There I don't think it was

1351
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:55,935
It's possible but I think there's a chance that was pretty important

1352
01:00:56,191 --> 01:01:02,335
Did Josh communion with a came out in 90

1353
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,359
1887

1354
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:08,223
So for the year I was born a happy birthday

1355
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:12,575
For however many years that is 30 something years

1356
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:15,903
There has been no demand for an audiobook

1357
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:22,303
Not one time has it been read on audio no one has wanted

1358
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:28,703
Audio book audio book

1359
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:30,495
Gay man

1360
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:36,895
What we're at is the we're going to reprint it how about you doing audiobook for 35 years or whatever

1361
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:37,919
Gotta want it

1362
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:43,551
I don't know you must have an audience fan base

1363
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:48,415
But I think it's not a selling point that he read it

1364
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:51,743
I think anybody else where you can get

1365
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:58,399
Weird NPR Garrison Keillor but creepy voice

1366
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:00,191
If you ever read it

1367
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:02,239
Review

1368
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:07,103
Skip over the next little chunk because they start talking about

1369
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:07,871
Drugs

1370
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:13,247
Okay DMT and they start talking about otherworldly experiences

1371
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:19,647
And then after like

1372
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:21,951
Five ten minutes of talking.

1373
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:23,487
I've never done

1374
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:27,071
I've never done any hallucinogenic at all

1375
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:27,839
What

1376
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:31,935
Get the f*** out of here it's not appropriate not appropriate

1377
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:38,335
Imagine

1378
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,359
Pretended drugs are

1379
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,895
Are bad or whatever

1380
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:42,687
That was a

1381
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:43,455
Symbolism

1382
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:44,735
Well

1383
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:45,503
You've got

1384
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:46,783
You got a lot of

1385
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:48,831
Throughout a lot of

1386
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,135
That are called psycho

1387
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,951
You're not familiar with that term

1388
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:55,743
You are

1389
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:57,023
Mister cultural osmosis

1390
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:58,047
We think of

1391
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:02,399
Celebrities would be like the Grim Reaper or the angel of death or

1392
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,679
Anniversary

1393
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:05,215
Egypt or Hermes

1394
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:07,775
Sportbelt

1395
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:08,543
Valkyries

1396
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:09,567
And some Norse mythology

1397
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,359
But these are figures that leave you a

1398
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:12,127
Frost depth

1399
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:12,895
Threshold

1400
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:13,919
I take you and they guide you

1401
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,967
Depending upon the Serta

1402
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:16,735
Religious system

1403
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:18,015
You might actually

1404
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:18,783
See them cross

1405
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:19,807
Your live stream

1406
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:21,343
As well

1407
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:22,367
Donna Leedy

1408
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:23,135
These figures

1409
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:24,671
But also you see

1410
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:26,975
Certain natural phenomena

1411
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:30,559
Episode of the Moon serving the psychopomp role of carrying Souls

1412
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:33,375
Animals

1413
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:34,399
And

1414
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:36,447
The animals that you see almost in body

1415
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,471
Almost always

1416
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:39,775
Companionship and or transport

1417
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,567
The way things like

1418
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:43,103
Obviously

1419
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:43,871
Meeting you at

1420
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:45,407
Being faithful

1421
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:46,431
Horses which

01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:49,247
Take you places that boring animals

1423
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,015
Birds which

1424
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:50,783
Can travel to play

1425
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:54,879
Knox

1426
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:00,767
Butterflies

1427
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,047
Cycle

1428
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:03,583
Soul away

1429
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:04,863
On your wings

1430
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:07,167
Mullets cuz my other creepy

1431
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:13,823
What is one reason the butterfly or like a bee

1432
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:18,687
Well a butterfly is a psycho pump in Mesoamerican called what about a be

1433
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:25,087
I think he's a pretty chill but they've got wings so they might as well be mosquito anything that has wings

1434
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:28,671
He literally said anything with wings sure

1435
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,695
Okay

1436
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:34,559
Pterodactyl here is here is his a psychopomp pterodactyl

1437
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:37,119
That's my new alias

1438
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:39,423
Stop doing the anthropology textbook

1439
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:44,287
He gets into the the new mythology he's creating which is essentially the

1440
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:46,591
We're all scared of death

1441
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:48,895
And these are all things that we've made up

1442
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:50,175
To help us get to die

1443
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:52,991
All of it

1444
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:54,271
UFOs

1445
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:56,831
What do you think of UFO is if not a fairy

1446
01:04:57,087 --> 01:05:03,231
If somebody was a 1500 they wouldn't know what a UFO is they'd say it was a fairy if somebody was in the thigh

1447
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:06,047
Thousands they wouldn't say it was a very they'd say it was a gym

1448
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:12,447
If somebody was in the 500 they wouldn't say the Jinn they would say the but you know so he's just racing all this same s*** back

1449
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:16,287
Back and back and back until you get to the very beginning and what it really is

1450
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:17,823
All afraid of death

1451
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:20,383
Oh and yeah the Sun and moths

1452
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:21,407
And mob

1453
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:23,711
The whole thing let me try this on

1454
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:27,039
Psychopomp in Psycho circumstance

1455
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:33,439
I don't know what that is love Pachelbel

1456
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:36,767
Is that your

1457
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:39,839
Graduate

1458
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:46,239
Canon in D

1459
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:51,359
But it's email graduation showcase

1460
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:55,199
Sampled by Vitamin C Graduation song

1461
01:05:55,455 --> 01:06:01,599
Well actually if you look at the history of Kamala do you like regular

1462
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:07,999
Remind us of death

1463
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,535
Hey

1464
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:12,351
But yeah so everything everything is about death

1465
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,631
Or is it

1466
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:18,239
I think it must be over maybe not there's more there's more

1467
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:22,079
Motif a lot of the behaviors

1468
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:24,895
What popular ufology would call UFO occupy

1469
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:26,943
Seems to me rural other

1470
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:27,967
Behavioral

1471
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,503
What's more I mean

1472
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:30,527
You are so is

1473
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:32,831
Is a transportation metaphor

1474
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:34,879
Like that's primarily what it is it

1475
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:35,903
What everybody talks

1476
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:39,999
Where they are where they come from how do they go here look at way they travel

1477
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:41,023
It's all about

1478
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:44,351
And transportation metaphors are almost

1479
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:45,119
Always

1480
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:46,143
Metaphors

1481
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:55,615
The River Styx that's the whole thing all right now is there is it actually about

1482
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:56,383
Technology

1483
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:57,663
From the future

1484
01:06:57,919 --> 01:07:03,551
From the other side there's technological elements do it this spacecraft

1485
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:04,575
Or the boat

1486
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,111
Right

1487
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:12,767
Strivers

1488
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,071
Argument could be made

1489
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:17,375
You know it we know Italy

1490
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:18,655
I know when

1491
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:20,447
The other side

1492
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,215
Does

1493
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:21,983
Have technology

1494
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:23,007
Because I'm wearing

1495
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:26,847
So there

1496
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:28,127
4 by wood

1497
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:28,895
UFOs

1498
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:29,663
BuzzFeed

1499
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:30,687
Technology

1500
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:31,711
From another world

1501
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:33,759
Now we got that gas

1502
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:36,063
That is

1503
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:41,951
A house built on Sand there is nothing supporting any of those premises

1504
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:48,607
Just because we've established that my earpiece is from the Dead Land

1505
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:55,007
Therefore there's technology from the dead land over here so why you not UFOs

1506
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,287
Here's the thing

1507
01:07:56,543 --> 01:08:01,663
Here's the thing about this and this is why I feel like this is our most non-racist

1508
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:09,855
The interview or whatever today silly kind of exactly because there are no metaphors

1509
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:12,927
For like the other is the Jew in this situation

1510
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:13,951
The other

1511
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:14,719
Is

1512
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:15,743
The up it's just

1513
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:22,143
It's really it's the literal other why are you even talking about Jews or or land Beyond Death

1514
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:29,567
No there's no mistaking it for something else you're going to listen to three more episodes of this anyway I take it all back

1515
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:32,383
Never going to listen to three more episodes that's the point mist

1516
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:39,039
You're going to be quite a demand for you to listen to any more of this

1517
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:45,695
So anyways at the end of that he said I can you guess what the fact

1518
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:48,767
That he eat at the end of it he goes well the fact is

1519
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:49,791
Can you guess what it

1520
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:53,631
I'll tell you if you think it's one fact

1521
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:57,215
You are wrong I was going to say something along the lines of like

1522
01:08:57,727 --> 01:09:02,847
You don't need birth control with your fuckos something like that I don't know

1523
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:05,151
Becca

1524
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:07,711
I have a

1525
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:09,247
Been in another world in a

1526
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:10,015
Jeep with

1527
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:10,783
Another guy

1528
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:11,551
This kid which

1529
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:12,831
This is all movies

1530
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:15,647
And

1531
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:17,951
Ridden the bicycle

1532
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:19,743
In another world down there

1533
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:21,791
Down the street here about a year ago

1534
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:23,071
You're in a half

1535
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:24,863
So

1536
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:27,679
Are these worlds

1537
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:29,471
Is there really sort of Anna

1538
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:32,031
Ethereal world of the Dead

1539
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:34,335
Are we kind of oscillating back

1540
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:35,103
And forth between

1541
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:36,127
22 very fish

1542
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:42,271
Or a third possibility

1543
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:44,063
In another world is interesting

1544
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:50,463
But far less interesting than him kidnapping a child in a jeep taking them to the

1545
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:55,839
Another world in a jeep with another guy's kid

1546
01:09:56,095 --> 01:10:02,239
Every step of that sentence gets worse

1547
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:08,639
Court transcripts

1548
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:15,039
Nickel the details but legally I can't

1549
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:20,159
Important

1550
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:21,183
Message to send

1551
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:24,255
Don't get into other people's food

1552
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:27,327
It's just sleep paralysis that's all this is

1553
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:32,191
Autobike yeah exactly in another world

1554
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:35,519
If he's asleep driving is Jeep with another person

1555
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:41,151
No problem

1556
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:46,271
So finally Cuts is going to get his chance to talk a little talking about his thing a little bit and

1557
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:50,367
Well I mean again he's trying to synthesize all of this into one just you know

1558
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:51,391
We're all afraid of death

1559
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:54,975
I hesitate a lot of time

1560
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:56,255
Times to go download

1561
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:58,303
Rabbit hole because

1562
01:10:58,559 --> 01:10:59,071
I think that we can

1563
01:10:59,327 --> 01:10:59,839
Conceptualize

1564
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:00,863
Dimensions

1565
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:02,911
Pretty

1566
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:04,703
Strange way like we think of it as a place

1567
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:05,471
Hugo

1568
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:06,495
Really if you look at

1569
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,799
Essays like flat landed

1570
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:10,079
It's about

1571
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:11,871
It's about

1572
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:13,407
If someone is a two-dimensional figure

1573
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:15,455
Finger on the page they're not going to see

1574
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:17,503
Your finger

1575
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:19,039
So I think that

1576
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:20,319
Sometimes we just

1577
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:21,855
Glitch in and out of these

1578
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:24,927
I think that sometimes

1579
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,463
We go there

1580
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:29,023
Mom where were you seeing and then submit

1581
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:29,791
Sometime witch

1582
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:31,071
Happens in

1583
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:33,631
Yes the UFO experience but also Ferry Lenox

1584
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:35,423
Experiences and also India

1585
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:36,959
And also some cryptic

1586
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:40,543
Muffins

1587
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:42,591
Even some

1588
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:44,639
Shamanic trap

1589
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:47,199
Workout a body traveling things like that

1590
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:50,527
Who sang that's all going into deadline

1591
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:51,295
Yep

1592
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,855
All of it that's his big revelation

1593
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:56,927
And that's why the the secret for him is like that

1594
01:11:57,183 --> 01:12:00,255
Even cryptozoology kind of situations

1595
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:01,791
Are actually this whole thing

1596
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:08,447
He used to be I mean he used to be the guy with otherworldly smells man here's what I tell you what he'll smells like

1597
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:09,727
Sulphur

1598
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:10,751
What about

1599
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:12,287
The ecology though

1600
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:17,663
I don't feel like I've gotten any grasp on ecologically ideas

1601
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:19,199
Well I mean

1602
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:20,991
Essentially it is

1603
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:22,783
Cure all these creatures

1604
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:25,855
Do they use photosynthesis

1605
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:32,255
Honestly he does get into some things like that where he'll be like when he was about the food

1606
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:38,655
Totally said that this is what that he's like a clearly that means

1607
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:45,055
That means that the fairies eat this so you know he's like that's totally what he does anybody make

1608
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:48,895
Picking up any food I will quote

1609
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:51,455
Literature metaphor

1610
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:58,111
Is it 100% when he died

1611
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:00,159
He's just throwing in

1612
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:02,463
Can anything he's like all the Canterbury Tales

1613
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:04,255
We see that horses that actually

1614
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:10,655
Written into the place where we know that horses are psychic

1615
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:14,495
So yeah I mean he wraps it up here and

1616
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:16,031
And I mean I kind of

1617
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:19,615
There are some things again like I hit stop

1618
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:21,663
Process makes a certain amount of sense

1619
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:23,455
If you if you follow it

1620
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,479
He's just

1621
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:27,039
Created a completely different world where it

1622
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:28,063
It happen

1623
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:29,087
Brightwell

1624
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:31,135
The thought process is okay

1625
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:31,903
But

1626
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:33,951
Be looking at

1627
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:34,975
Empirical evidence

1628
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:38,303
Should lead you using that thought process

1629
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:40,351
To conclude that this is all b*******

1630
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,167
He just skip to the part with the evidence

1631
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:49,567
Process I don't have a problem but it's the application

1632
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:50,591
I think what it is

1633
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:51,359
Is

1634
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:55,455
For so long you know we've been living with people who don't live in reality

1635
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:59,039
But in such a way as to exploit it for or to

1636
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:02,367
Alter it in some way where is it feels like this guy was just like

1637
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:03,391
Nope

1638
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:05,695
Unreality

1639
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:06,463
Nope

1640
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,743
I'm going to do something else

1641
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:09,791
Fairyland

1642
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:10,815
That's what I'm doing

1643
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:12,095
Cool

1644
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:13,631
What happens when a culture

1645
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:15,423
A global culture

1646
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:16,447
Is Maps

1647
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:17,727
More or less ever

1648
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:18,751
Square inch of the

1649
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,031
We find that there is

1650
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:22,079
What happens to

1651
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:22,847
I would argue

1652
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:24,383
Transposed

1653
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:25,151
To the Stars

1654
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:26,175
All that baggage

1655
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:27,199
We've always had

1656
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:28,479
The psychopomps

1657
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:29,247
Votive

1658
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:30,783
The Transporter

1659
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:32,063
The sun pulling the

1660
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:34,879
Pulling the Chariot of the sun across the

1661
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:35,647
The sky all that

1662
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:36,415
It's transpose

1663
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:37,183
Used to this

1664
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:38,719
Very 20th

1665
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:39,743
21st century

1666
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:40,511
Moteefe

1667
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:41,791
The UFO

1668
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:43,839
Sure

1669
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:46,655
This point is basically

1670
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:52,031
We create things based upon our responses to culture and belief system

1671
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:57,919
And they're essentially the same things going back and back and back we just update them as we update technology

1672
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:58,687
Right

1673
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:02,271
And the the idea that underlies the like

1674
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:05,599
Okay so somewhere on Earth there is this

1675
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:10,207
Underworld or whatever and around there is no underworld

1676
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:11,999
So we put it into the Stars

1677
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:13,279
And then eventually we're going to

1678
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:15,071
Be able to go into the Stars where to find it

1679
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:17,119
It's not there so they'll be another thing

1680
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:23,519
It's because the underlying thought or whatever it is is what's more important than the idea of actually fine

1681
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:25,823
Finding the underworld or whatever

1682
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:29,919
So now if you were to take this and to just look at it from like okay

1683
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:32,991
Now let's let's apply this to like human psychology

1684
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:35,551
That seems like an appropriate neck

1685
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:36,319
Spell wrecked

1686
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:38,367
But I don't feel like that's what he's doing no

1687
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:39,135
Okay

1688
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:46,047
Cool I mean it is kind of fascinating insofar as he tries to he tries to reconcile that with this

1689
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:47,839
It's idea of co-creation

1690
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:51,935
Right and he acknowledges that all of this stuff is in our head

1691
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:54,751
That's the that's the reality

1692
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:55,775
But

1693
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:58,079
There is also another world worth actually real

1694
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:01,663
The fairies have a physical body double my friend right

1695
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:04,223
And that is how things work exist in your head

1696
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:06,527
Accepting that other world where the

1697
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:08,063
We create them

1698
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:09,855
Iamthebay exist

1699
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:11,391
And that's how it work

1700
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:13,183
Right so we

1701
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:15,487
You know I don't know map it used to be there be monster

1702
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:21,887
You know it's just what you're saying it's it's a hippogriff it's Turtles all the way down you know it

1703
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:23,935
It's it's just always going to be another turtle

1704
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:24,959
Yeah yeah

1705
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:27,007
Isn't that

1706
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:29,055
That's the the

1707
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:31,359
The concept is that like a tulpa

1708
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:33,919
No I don't think so

1709
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:38,015
I believe that's the the name of like an idea of like something that you

1710
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:38,783
You think of

1711
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:40,831
And it becomes real

1712
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:46,463
Delegate the manifestation of an imaginary thing that I've heard like

1713
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:49,279
Used in some of these other like soda

1714
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:54,143
Project Camelot interviews and stuff people with these sort of

1715
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:56,959
Theosophist store

1716
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:59,007
Paranormal ideas

1717
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:03,615
Right I mean that's that's kind of what he's he's that's why people love him so much

1718
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:07,455
It's because he's trying to make it so everything is real

1719
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,735
Right away you believe it

1720
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:10,015
But

1721
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:16,415
The Voice where everybody's mixing things up is there forgetting that this is all about transitioning into the other world

1722
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:17,695
Midnight about

1723
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:21,535
Fighting or or belief systems or whatever it is

1724
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:23,071
It's all created

1725
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:29,471
Because you're afraid of you mean to tell me that it is okay if somebody who associated with The Tall Blond aliens

1726
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:31,007
Getting out of the baseball game

1727
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:39,199
We've all come to the right place to hold onto this

1728
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:45,599
If you have others in the right around the corner for you buddy I guess it is

1729
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:47,135
Respond to this

1730
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:49,439
Tour de force of his argument

1731
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:51,743
The summation of you apology

1732
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:53,535
The whole thing I'm going to guess

1733
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:56,351
You lived in Wisconsin

1734
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:58,143
Then yeah

1735
01:17:59,167 --> 01:17:59,679
Folks for

1736
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:02,495
I have major allergies

1737
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:03,263
Jesus always

1738
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:04,543
Everybody knows

1739
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:05,311
These days

1740
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:06,847
Anyway

1741
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:10,943
I have remembered

1742
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:11,711
The break

1743
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:12,479
But that I

1744
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:13,503
It's not a break

1745
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:14,527
This is the end of the show

1746
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:16,319
For the Freedom Riders

1747
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:22,463
Oh oh

1748
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:24,511
Bad remember the bridge

1749
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:30,399
I have allergies I'm confused it's a break oh no it's the end of the show

1750
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:33,215
That's the whole thing

1751
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:37,055
That's not it that's that's kind of ending with a whimper

1752
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:42,687
Yep well I mean I guess the show continued on it behind a paywall but that's just not happen

1753
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:47,551
Yeah not happening to the real stuff man

1754
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:50,623
I honestly almost there just cuz I wanted to see if you finished

1755
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:55,743
The story of the other guy who's going to lunch

1756
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:56,767
I'm going to guess not

1757
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:59,071
I would love to use what I want you to do

1758
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:01,119
I want you to keep listening

1759
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:02,143
I want

1760
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:05,471
I need you to find the story of the guy in the Jeep

1761
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:09,055
Other person sketch

1762
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:15,455
For legal reasons I think you need to put that stuff because otherwise we

1763
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:18,783
Baby needs to be reported to the authorities

1764
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:23,647
That is a good point I think we're sitting on a lot of need to be reported in this

1765
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:30,047
Yes it is interesting I mean it's benign it seems like for the most part that's what I was going

1766
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:31,071
Going for I wanted

1767
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:31,839
Fun

1768
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:33,631
Benign fun

1769
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:36,959
No looking your eyes away from the Veil

1770
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:37,983
Bulshit

1771
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:38,751
Sure

1772
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:40,031
It's just right there

1773
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:42,847
It's all real but the lesson that we've learned

1774
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:47,199
From doing the show for Dino 56 years is that that doesn't exist

1775
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:52,831
That is still in here somewhere but not from the guy who plays the funk tuba

1776
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:57,439
That's fair food that is always safe harbor

1777
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:58,463
I mean come on

1778
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:03,839
It takes a it takes a certain confidence to take up the TV

1779
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:05,375
You know

1780
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:08,447
It's not it's an instrument that most people gravitate towards

1781
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:16,128
What's that one that the sousaphone is on the wraps around that's the that's the marching tuba

1782
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:19,968
That's a lot that's a man who's wearing a lot of sousaphones in his day

1783
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:22,784
And as a former marching band member

1784
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:23,808
I salute you

1785
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:29,440
I I did not I did not join the marching band like I said I play French horn for a little while

1786
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:30,976
Then I quit

1787
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:31,744
Cuz it sucked

1788
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:38,912
Well then that's the end of the episode that I have for you as well thank you I would say this is Ben

1789
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,448
A lot of fun

1790
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:47,104
Appreciate you finding something benign to talk about

1791
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,128
Next week

1792
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:52,480
Will have an episode for you probably not in Dreamland

1793
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:54,784
No certainly I think we may actually even like

1794
01:20:55,296 --> 01:21:00,672
Find out what the predictions for 2020 three kind of up in the air at this point

1795
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:02,464
But until then we have

1796
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:08,864
Droz.com we are on Twitter

1797
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,144
Neither

1798
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,448
Leo dzx Clark

1799
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:17,056
Nora by Daryl rundas I'm not the juiciest Ice Cube

1800
