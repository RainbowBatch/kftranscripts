00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:23,040
Jordan

00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:29,440
Knowledge bike I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy or the bad guy

3
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:35,840
Knowledge

00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:42,240

College.com

7
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:07,840
Let's sit around and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

8
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:14,240
What's up

9
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:17,312
Is abs

10
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:23,968
Bright spots are a little bit trivial in nature summer just like an album we enjoy or

11
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,808
X trivia

12
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:34,208
Right and today I had a good ice cream flavors listen to Sirius 2f

13
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,000
Struggled with sleep

14
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:39,584
And such but it's been going a lot better over the past week

15
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,608
I've been

16
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:44,448
Managing to keep a better like sleep schedule and like I'm not

17
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,568
I don't want to get ahead of myself of course because these things happen sometimes getting

18
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,384
A good Rhythm and make it then it gets thrown off but

19
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,992
I mean sleep has been one of the things that had plagued me the most in terms of like

20
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,272
The path of my life

21
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:02,880
So I got to like laying in bed for hours not being able to fall asleep and and

22
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,416
And such an m

23
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:09,280
It's up it's been it's been great and this is this is partially

24
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,888
This is my bright spot and that's hardly a bit of a announcement

25
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,544
And that is what this episode never sleep again ever

26
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,640
Okay and the reason for that is I'm going to

27
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:31,040
Advance publishing schedule

28
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:34,368
I'm at for a really long time but when I tried to do it like

29
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:40,000
Years and years ago it didn't work right and so I'm going to set up this episode to post

30
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,792
At a decent hour

31
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,608
So I can in future schedule posts ahead of time

32
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:51,008
That might be why

33
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,824
I look forward to hopefully being able to keep this up

34
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,224
Because it's it feels so much better spot for me than it is for you that's been a cheap source of concern for me for

35
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,624
For God damn years now you know and it's I'm trapped in this helpless but I can't sleep for you Dad no but

36
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,024
Kamalame or something guitar over the head

37
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,072
Those were good days by the way

38
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,120
Brightspot

39
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:20,192
I know that we discuss this

40
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,496
I'm a little bit worried about Uncle howdy

41
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:28,384
Just an update on that okay okay oh worried about worried about Oklahoma

42
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,272
Anyway which is greater concern reporting that I am still worried

43
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:41,440
I want my bright spot is today it's that time of year today is the start of awesome games done

00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:01,023
Jesus Christ so Jordan today we have a Depo

110
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:06,655
Position that is from the Connecticut case that that is where

111
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:13,311
We are at this this is a fella by the name of Tim fruge

112
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:19,711
Yeah I don't know if you know much about the other man

113
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:26,111
Dimensions of him in emails and suction he's got something to do with the marketing but the internet

114
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,951
Right he is like a stuffed with the online sales

115
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:36,351
And he's the business director basically large umbrella set of

116
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:39,423
Things that that is responsible for

117
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,751
Having grown from the position of just being like

118
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:49,151
In charge of some Warehouse stuff employee that Alex hired ever

119
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:55,551
He was a Michael j.fox it from The Mailroom to the top of the board he's he's been around pretty much

120
00:08:55,807 --> 00:09:00,671
Forever as he tells in his backstory for this in this deposition

121
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:06,047
He was working at like a dry cleaner kind of business or his delivering

122
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:12,447
Things like trying to sign up new client with Service app and then from there transitioned into

123
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,055
Alex mailroom stuff as you put it

124
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:23,455
And then just things kept going as it grude more responsibilities adidon until he

125
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,479
He was the

126
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:30,879
Head of business you know I mean if it weren't for them being part of Infowars there's a certain

127
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:37,279
Charm to their ragtag hiring process that I I mean I don't know it's mostly

128
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:43,679
Contact space

129
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:49,055
That was the fastest I've ever had that

130
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:55,455
I need you in my warehouse project

131
00:09:55,711 --> 00:10:01,855
I have long been interested into a shape because he's in that it's a name that rings out

132
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,647
Through like the entire time that I've

133
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,671
Done this podcast

134
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:11,327
He is someone that Alex references obliquely his name shows up places right as laikoro

135
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,119
Run it by Tim

136
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:19,519
I wouldn't put it that way I don't know who's the money man but he's

137
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,079
A lot of admin kind of

138
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,127
Various places pops up

139
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,431
And I realized

140
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,967
When I sat down to look at

141
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:32,063
Deposition that I ain't never seen Tim for Jaipur

142
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:35,647
Wow and he is a Charming

143
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:39,231
Looking forty-two-year-old

144
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:45,631
I don't want to know I'm not saying this in any kind of pejorative way but has a thick boy

145
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:52,031
Charles Hart

146
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:58,431
Call Coop.

147
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:01,247
He just he strikes you as

148
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:06,367
Like a cool guy that your dad knows or something

149
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:13,535
I'm looking at him right now and me and maybe it's not it's not a big beard though

150
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,887
30 years from now that's a Santa Claus but right now he's cool Santa you know I

151
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,703
I picture young Santa Claus with a giant beard but it's like

152
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,775
Not what

153
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:30,175
Regardless of and I should also say that I was routinely called young Santa Claus while I was in

154
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,463
He strikes you as

155
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,279
Like a pretty generally decent fella

156
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:50,399
Interesting and that is interesting because you're not used to that

157
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,423
No

158
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:56,031
LOL say I had a fairly positive impression of him

159
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,847
Through this and then by the end of this I think he's

160
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:05,247
Maybe one of the worst people who works at if I was going to say this is freaking me out no it's a it's a very

161
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,063
Path that it takes to get there but

162
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,623
Turn the right temperature

163
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:17,279
He sat for a deposition in January 2022 having previously said four like

164
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,815
A really brief one

165
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,631
And then he comes back

166
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,679
I'm doing this remotely

167
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:30,079
And we're going to start here at the first clip there's obviously the beginning quite a bit of

168
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:30,847
Look like

169
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,615
You know

170
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:35,711
Introduction what did you do to prepare for this

171
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:42,111
Questions you know like the answer yes or no just so we can calibrate the device getting them will get into the Rhythm questions

172
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,135
What have you

173
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:49,535
We get to jumping in here while they're discussing the. Of Infowars growth they were seeing

174
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,559
Quite a bit of growth

175
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,887
And in the context of that we learned Tim's salary okay

176
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,191
And you were right you were aware

177
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
No

178
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,735
I would not I was never involved in the sales at that point

179
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,551
That would happen

180
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,599
In the 2000s

181
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,391
11 2012

182
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:23,327
Somewhere in that time frame yes as we grew there was just need for people to step up

183
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,119
And

184
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,703
I was there and I was willing to learn and

185
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,007
And step up and help where I was needed

186
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,527
Around that time was to oversee

187
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,319
Online store

188
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,767
Correct as well as you know ordering office supplies and handling

189
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
You know

190
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
Your

191
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,911
Your AC guy is your plumbing guys your construction guys that was sort of my

192
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,703
What I was doing at that time

193
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,615
Salary menu

194
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:17,343
Best I can remember it was either 45 or 50,000

195
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,111
Annually

196
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,695
Was it when you

197
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,583
Or when you when you separated

198
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,447
It was $200,000 a

199
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,495
Goddamn

200
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,823
200,000 a year

201
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:45,503
So we have the on-air personalities that we've seen like Owen Troyer he makes

202
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,087
About Daria makes about 100,000 a year

203
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,903
And yeah it's a a 200,000

204
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:58,559
Hey you know you started fifty Grand you have more responsibilities that are added on I kind of like it

205
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
Normal

206
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:05,727
Assertive trajectory and Pat it's just it's got its got quite High

207
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,543
I don't know capitalism

208
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,567
Anymore

209
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,591
You know like

210
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:16,991
Hermione for my decade in in because I was kind of in sales you know so I never got raise

211
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:23,391
Is there anything it was either I did good or bad there's not Mission yeah yeah there's that whole thing

212
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:28,767
You like that is that is absolutely not how describes his

213
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:35,167
The conversation he went to work every day and at the end of the year he either got a promotion or did he did that corporate thing that people have

214
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:41,567
Talked about in my world that I've never experienced his responsibilities deepveer into sale

215
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,847
Advertise

216
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
Strange

217
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:48,735
A lot is that a little Tomatoes like a lot

218
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,759
But I don't know if

219
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,599
Still that is real that is also

220
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:59,999
And then if you look at it just on the scale of like what we know of other Infowars people what they're making

221
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:00,767
Beasley

222
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,327
You pay people want like

223
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,863
You think they deserve

224
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,167
Abby died I would think that that's

225
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,191
Kind of how

226
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,263
Payroll generally Works according to this

227
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,615
Obviously tempers his role is more important than Alex's

228
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:22,015
Second banana on-air personality

229
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:28,415
He's more important than knowing you can replace Owen but you got to keep the money flowing like it or not you know the only problem I guess

230
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,975
Yes I have is I'm not sure exactly what's meant by money man

231
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:37,631
You know like I feel like money man is a guy who injects money is something like ten million dollar man

232
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,263
You know more about the guy who's who's in control who's who's at the at the like

233
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:49,663
Loggerhead of the flow of money right right right there and all the money flow comes towards him

234
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,687
And then he kind of

235
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:57,087
Directed elsewhere I do think that's probably fairly idea

236
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:00,159
A lot to not that great

237
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,743
You can replace it with another contest

238
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,815
Borrow this fella

239
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:10,399
He's grown with the company to heat

240
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,423
I really

241
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,239
Man I'm conflicted about this guy anyway

242
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,263
He left

243
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,287
Infowars

244
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,335
In September 2020

245
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:22,175
And then I was gone for about a year Jordan came back

246
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:27,295
And he came back you came back well I mean 200k you can't really earn quite as much everywhere

247
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:31,903
He might've been doing fine we'll find out where you landed

248
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:36,511
His return makes some sense to me actually

249
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:42,911
Albie's you could look at it suspicious laying like are in the middle of this litigation and get this guy back in the fold or whatever

250
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:50,335
Keith as he describes it him and his wife are both from Texas and they'd moved to Utah for another job

251
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:54,431
And they visited Texas and they saw their family and they realized

252
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:57,247
Miss my family I want to come back

253
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,295
Alex offered him his job back

254
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:05,439
And you know he came back that doesn't feel suspicious to me at all

255
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,231
But it is

256
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
Weird

257
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:12,095
Loyalty that I wouldn't expect from any company I've ever worked at

258
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:12,863
You know

259
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:18,751
I live for a year they probably be like sorry you shouldn't have f****** left a****** you know that's true

260
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,311
You got to consider how things ended

261
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,103
In this next clip

262
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,663
Circumstances

263
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,063
I

264
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,879
Was stressed to the max

265
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,463
I have some health conditions

266
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:44,863
And the stress was getting to me and everything kind of came to

267
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:49,215
I had when me and Alex got into an argument and

268
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,287
I grabbed my bag told him to

269
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,359
Go off and walked out

270
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,639
That was the end of it

271
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:08,415
I'm being Alex Jones I'm he was just complaining about everything I was trying to help

272
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,975
He was complaining about something else

273
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:17,119
I don't remember too much of the details but it was

274
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,679
It was Alex

275
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:23,519
Being Alex as far as

276
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:30,431
I can't say the word cuz I don't want to swear but

277
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,735
He he was just being a jerk

278
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:39,391
So Alex is being an a****** from

279
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:42,719
And watching this that maybe Tim doesn't like Alex that much

280
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:49,375
I mean you know if that's that's the problem with your foreshadowing on him being the worst purse

281
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:55,775
Maybe potential is up there you know that kind of a very interesting

282
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,543
My first

283
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,823
Hackles are being raised

284
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:01,919
This seems like a person who is capable of agency and thought

285
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:06,527
And that makes him terrifying because that that's a big part of it

286
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:10,367
You go be the worst person you know like panties a bit of a straight shooter

287
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:16,767
You know what the f****** a****** that's why I quit

288
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:23,167
Did you quit being Alex

289
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:29,567
Because this is

290
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:33,663
Starts to give you a good impression of him because you're like yeah

291
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,943
That makes total sense

292
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:39,807
Do you put up with it for a long time you probably making way more money than you would have been

293
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:44,671
In some other career makes sense finally had enough of this a******

294
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:48,255
Sure I mean the problem though is

295
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,559
The Moore agency you have

296
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,375
The more responsibility you have for your action

297
00:20:53,887 --> 00:21:00,031
You know that's that's the way it's always kind of the math is worked out in my head I think Alex is a piece of s*** but I also don't

298
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,591
Think Alex really can control his behavior at

299
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,127
You know like

300
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:10,527
That that sucks but use the slave of many decisions that he made years and years ago

301
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:16,928
Prayers that he has put upon himself but you still has completely disagree with you on that

302
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:23,072
Nuances that are pushing him in in various directions

303
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:27,680
Tim has more awareness and more

304
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:34,592
Sort of clarity of decision-making than a lot of the other people that we've seen deposed or

305
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:37,408
Sphere

306
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,176
And

307
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:42,784
He doesn't seem as desperate either at that as now somebody's other

308
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,064
Dorks right

309
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,392
So yeah he quit because Alex treated him poorly

310
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,928
It turns out

311
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,232
Acquit

312
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,752
In that stress

313
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,544
Had to do with

314
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,104
Your responsibilities for the way in which

315
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,992
The way

316
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,088
All the issues that at that place there are

317
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,392
Forest fires everyday

318
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,416
And

319
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,744
At that moment the reason I walked out it was the

320
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,792
Alex Jones was treating me

321
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,840
So that's interesting and like

322
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:34,496
You seems like if there's forest fires everyday then a high-pressure work environment

323
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:40,128
Something that's going to be like why you quit things work around here

324
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,944
Just Alex being a dick

325
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,296
Which but that's another thing about the choices there is that

326
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:51,392
If he is saying that that is happening and that's why he quit

327
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,208
And also saying there's forest fires every day

328
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,256
What that means is that he's watched

329
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:01,120
Alex be an a****** to countless people and watch them run out

330
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:04,704
And this is when Alex started being a real piece of s*** to him first

331
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,984
You know what I mean

332
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,032
Yeah that could be

333
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:13,664
I have some slight theories that are may be impossible to prove

334
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,968
But very Reason by this next clip

335
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:21,088
That's correct

336
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,160
Yes

337
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,000
Ready Alliance Group

338
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,048
What's that

339
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:33,632
And is actually a dry cleaner

340
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,400
The

341
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,240
Storable food company that

342
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,008
No

343
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,568
No slide out

344
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,104
The storable food that he saw

345
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,296
Yes

346
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,648
Work

347
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,184
Cracked

348
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,000
So there's a part of this that is

349
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:00,768
You know

350
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:07,168
Kind of understandable you're the guys working in these business relationship sure you would know these people and you could go ahead

351
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,752
You know you got a place totally that makes some sense

352
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:14,080
But then you also have to consider that this is September 2020

353
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,896
This is during the sort of

354
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:23,296
Middle beginning of the covid time this is when Alex is pushing the server

355
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:28,672
Storable food where they are needing to expand

356
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:34,304
They are setting up a new warehouses they are a company that is in severe growth

357
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:38,400
I would not be too surprised

358
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,448
If there was an understanding

359
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:43,520
Or something where it's like you go

360
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:49,152
Go work for them for a bit or something I can't prove that just a total Theory

361
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,456
But Alex maintained a

362
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:54,784
Very very close relationship with the storable food people

363
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,832
That continued

364
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,368
Through this time there was

365
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:02,464
I remember when it was there was like a time that he went to Utah himself

366
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,048
For the storable food visiting that

367
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:10,400
It seems like this is all the way too closely connected for it to just be like

368
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:16,800
I quit Infowars and that I got a job at the their mate one of their main sponsors

369
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,824
About that tho

370
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,592
Is that

371
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:21,664
To me that makes a lot of sense just from

372
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,736
It's like no no

373
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:27,552
Malicious behavior kind of situation just because

374
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:31,392
If you're making 200k a year and you want to leave that job

375
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:33,696
There aren't many jobs where you could step in

376
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,000
Do a similar kind of salary point

377
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:42,400
Without having an intense personal relationship with the people already there it's true so you know maybe if

378
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,680
He's not going to go

379
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:48,800
At McDonald's or some s*** you know he gets over there maybe doesn't make as much money

380
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:52,384
But he's got a position over there he's not starting over

381
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,200
There's a benign explanation for

382
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,992
And I understand that

383
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:00,576
I think that there's a very decent chance that that is what is it play

384
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:04,928
I also have some misgivings about

385
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,464
How Alex would take that

386
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,000
Totally

387
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,560
If he leaves on bad terms

388
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,096
With Infowars out early

389
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:16,704
I find it kind of hard to believe that Alex would be okay with him

390
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:23,104
Taking a roll veterans somewhere in the ballpark of $200,000 right he's one of his main sponsors

391
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,896
I find that difficult

392
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:28,224
It is possible I don't know it's just weird with with people

393
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:28,992
Such as this

394
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:34,112
Who have established a track record of malicious behavior

395
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,672
Do not require it or even ask

396
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:41,024
This is definitely a situation where

397
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,120
Is possible to read too much into this

398
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,936
It's just weird

399
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:54,336
I bet ordering dinner there's something Shady going on with these assholes you know you can't tell you don't even know why

400
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,128
Yep yep

401
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,968
Type of people drink half a drink

402
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,016
And then send it back and say that's not what I order

403
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:08,416
Alex made his kid a rope swing under a tree branch Shady

404
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,696
Right there

405
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:16,096
Discuss the revenue stream back in the day

406
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:18,912
It was another supplement to my Clare

407
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:21,216
So you had things like

408
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:27,616
Advertising gold sales the cut Kickbacks of all the the filters the whole thing

409
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,432
You had a lot of that but then there was another thing

410
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:34,784
Correct

411
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:39,648
What I believe yes at that time he was still selling advertising

412
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,488
.

413
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,024
Between

414
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:52,192
So there were times where no there were no

415
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,264
Advertising sponsors

416
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,312
Anyting

417
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:02,688
At certain time. I couldn't tell you which ones were out that that time frame

418
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:06,016
There was no sponsors for advertisers

419
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:11,648
Mr. Jones would have

420
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,864
In addition to advertising

421
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,848
And wanted to highlight their own products

422
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,016
This is the first time that there has been

423
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,040
Concrete

424
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:45,696
Recognition of pay-to-play we've been talking about that for years it's been suggested by

425
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,720
Remember folks it's

426
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:52,096
Something that's been discussed on message board and people have theorized about it

427
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:55,680
Anonymous comments but yeah this is

428
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,984
This is the first time that I can see if there is like

429
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,312
Actually definitive this is something that I Alex offered

430
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,848
You can pay

431
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,896
To get him to promote your stuff

432
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,944
And pretend that it is

433
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:13,344
Just a regular interview

434
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:20,768
We're going to get more into this later in the deposition so put a pin in that but that was a really big moment

435
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,840
Now in terms of my understanding the house operate

436
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:28,704
There's so many times where it's like there's no way that this is not pay to play

437
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,264
But to have them concretely say it

438
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,056
That's comfort

439
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:39,712
Yeah you'll be surprised to learn what the rates were not high enough or too high is the question

440
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,016
We'll get to it okay

441
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,320
The product that

442
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,880
They ended up selling liquor supplements or what have you

443
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:51,232
Alex likes to pretend they have like Infowars lab

444
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:55,328
And you like a developing all these product

445
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:58,656
Because it gives like more intimate a connection with

446
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,936
The product itself

447
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:04,800
It feels like it's it's something it's more directly to know yeah but unfortunately that's all

448
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,080
Mr. Jones

449
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,408
That he intended to sell online

450
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,432
Crap crap

451
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:17,344
Mr. Jones

452
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:27,840
I guess so I'm not sure I know I was not involved

453
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,752
That possibly yes

454
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,872
Aware of

455
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,432
Systems ever

456
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,224
Investing any money in

457
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,784
Research and development

458
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,344
I'm not aware of

459
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,440
Why would they

460
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,024
Your understanding

461
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,304
That

462
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,960
Suppliers

463
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:05,984
And then

464
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,824
Rams down

465
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,384
Alex Jones

466
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,200
That's my understanding

467
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,624
Yes obviously that's what they did they just put a different label

468
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:29,024
On everything that we sell it but also why not sometimes we just you are indeed though

469
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,072
Company take cheap s***

470
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:37,472
Speak to it and pretend that it's magical in some way and then put another

471
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:43,872
Fun label on it totally market up the markup is Alex holding a picture of it that's it that's the whole thing

472
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,152
Something like

473
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:48,480
Chaga mushroom

474
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,272
Salaciously

475
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:54,880
Adding Force to all of it that's all you need or super Blanc

476
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,672
Super Blanc

477
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:03,584
Things that Alex likes to pretend he's that he's not that connected to like

478
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,168
How how is show is moving products

479
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:11,520
You know it's just all these is on there

480
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:15,360
And obviously he's got to be concerned that some of the business side of things

481
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,896
But he is not like

482
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:19,200
Doing things in order to like

483
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:19,968
Kush

484
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:23,040
Na na na

485
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,832

00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,256
More and more

489
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,328
Simply managing

490
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,216
Aspen

491
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,152
But mr. Jones was also involved

492
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,688
In

493
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,016
Operation on a daily basis

494
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,296

Yes

499
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,240
Because mr. Jones

500
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,544
Wood

501
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,592

Nutcracker

505
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:41,888
Wow Shady cynical

506
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:48,544
Alex gets out there starts screaming about God and all this stuff and then gets

507
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:56,992
Excuse me Pharisees let's change somebody in the church real quick come on now it is

508
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,528
Oblique portrait

509

Free day

510
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,088
Evan sucks

511
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:06,976
What if we had a TV show or something like that

512
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,536
That would be the part that sucks the most

513
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:13,888
Is like having to give a s*** about what the sales were on your thing like

514
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:20,288
All I've ever wanted to do is do the show part it seems like that is part that I

515
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:26,688
Enjoy so maybe

516
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:31,552
What are the things that you get looking at this too is that

517
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:36,160
Kind of a bummer to recognize that Infowars is like a business business

518
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:39,488
Yeah you know the various that Mystique that Alex

519
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,560
Has about himself or adjective

520
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:48,960
Tomorrow's Buddy Guy everyday

521
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:51,008
Big located by Ed's work today

Songs

524
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,992
I'm so glad we hooked Elsa

525
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:08,672
David Jones Alex's dad and his deposition mentioned how whenever they see big spikes in traffic they tried

526
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:10,464
To replicate

527
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,536
As you would I am so this is brought up

528
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,840
Then receive 10 minutes

529
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,120
In on this

530
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,144
Disorder game

531
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:22,240
I'll represent to you that Mr Jones testify

532
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,544
Testified in substance that

533
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,128
AJ what time

534
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,408
When

535
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,552
There was

536
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,488
Try to determine what my

537
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:50,656
No I don't recall I never

538
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:53,216
Redder

539
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,264
Watch David Jones is staying but

540
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:58,080
That makes sense in business it

541
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:00,128
Something is working to keep doing that

542
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,432
Yeah man

543
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,200
Something

544
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:05,248
Mr. Jones endeavor

545
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,136
Objection

546
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,928
I don't know what he's

547
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,464
Thinking but

548
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,280
You know like I said I would provide him the information

549
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:20,864
What he does on his show is his thing I never

550
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:24,192
Talk to him about what he plays on the show

551
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,472
Her anything

552
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:29,056
But if he requested the information I would give it to him and he did what he

553
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,336
What he does

554
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,552
Personally

555
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,608
Maximizing the store

556
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,680
I mean

557
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:58,752
To what I could do on my side yes

558
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,848
Window wizard

559
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,384
In

560
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,712
In Revenue

561
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,296
Trying to

562
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,976
Objection no I never

563
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:22,560
If there was a spike in sales

564
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,608
During his show

565
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:30,496
I would tell him whatever you did worked because the cells increase I never

566
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:32,032
I never looked at a show

567
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:38,176
I mean I can't I can't listen to his truck too much for me

568
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,552
It's very distracting while I was working I never

569
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,112
I have no idea what he was doing on a show

570
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,720
But you would think him

571
00:37:54,304 --> 00:38:00,448
Alex's show is too much for him that is some psychopath s*** right there really is that is some really terrifying

572
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:04,032
Crying like oh yeah no I get that he Slaughters young boys but

573
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:10,432
Don't it just cuz I said I don't watch it just cuz I work there doesn't mean that I care all I'm concerned with

574
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:16,832
Selling ads for the slaughter

575
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:23,232
Water than join the thought right

576
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:26,048
My heart that had on and then I go home after work is over

577
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,632
Obviously not necessarily as Extreme as Slaughter but I like

578
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:36,032
It is a real or enough thing

579
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,824
That to me is bleak

580
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,360
There is a

581
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:45,760
Real cynical approach to ethics that's the type of s*** that I got from the second clip of it's like this

582
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:46,528
This dude

583
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:49,344
Knows what he's doing in his choosing like f*** it

584
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,880
Auto Care

585
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,952
Consider

586
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:59,840
He's been around for a decade ever brought on

587
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:02,144
And he was there for a decade

588
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,424
Wow Alex

589
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:09,312
Just did all this s*** that's like I don't fucken want to watch this nonsense every day I choose to go to work

590
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:16,736
Alex is out there helping storm the capitol

591
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:17,504
Can I go to work

592
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,624
Alex is in the Capitol building that's interesting soul.

593
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:29,024
Spike in sales while Alex is in the f****** Capitol building

594
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,656
Court is saying the same to Hook families are exaggerating

595
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:41,824
F****** insane and a little bit later to

596
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:44,128
What's crazy about it to me is like

597
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,944
They they really do

598
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:53,600
Evaluate Alex's show like any AD campaign would be evaluated you know like so if we hired

599
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:59,232
Jon Hamm for this car commercial does Jon Hamm sell more cars than if we hired Sam Jacks

600
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:03,328
So you know like that kind of thinking only it's Alex's entire show

601
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,888
The show itself is the ad

602
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,168
For the ship

603
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:13,568
You know and I mean like as this goes on they could talk about being able to have like hour-by-hour breakdown

604
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:16,640
Sounds of like way more traffic going to the store

605
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:21,504
There's so much more awareness of like what they're doing from a business standpoint

606
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,296
Then you'd ever get from

607
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:27,648
Any interviewer deposition with Alex or corporate representative

608
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,672
Use Google Analytics

609
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:33,024
You know it's stupid honesty speak into that is like

610
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,304
I mean it's

611
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,584
This is a tentacle it's

612
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,864
I'd say that

613
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,656
II

614
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,680
I am

615
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:45,312
Remit I I won't say that like he's worse than people who do s***

616
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:51,200
Who do bad black lives matter flag on fire

617
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:51,968
You know

618
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:54,528
There's blame to go both ways

619
00:40:54,784 --> 00:41:00,928
But this is someone who knows better oh yeah and he's not a True Believer yeah and that to me is

620
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,464
Carrier a little bit

621
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,256
Absolutely I mean

622
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:08,352
It's it seems extreme to be like oh this person watches

623
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,632
The kids Slaughter

624
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:14,752
But we're talking about somebody who lost a lawsuit for 1.5 billion f****** dollars

625
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:19,360
Truly awful behavior and he was like amen

626
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:21,152
I just got to work you know

627
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:26,528
I was like I was there selling ads the entire time Alex was defaming these family

628
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:32,928
Total now that you've lost 1.5 billion dollars I still work for him and I don't really care that much

629
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:39,584
Willing to say in a deposition I don't listen to his showed stupid

630
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,376
Not going to go well

631
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:46,752
Will get more into this later the deposition

632
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:49,568
Tim knows that the stuff Alex is saying is b*******

633
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,640
He knows he knows that like

634
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:55,967
I can't watch a show the ads that are being sold

635
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:03,903
Based on tricking people with b******* with stuff that he knows

636
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:04,671
That sucks

637
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:05,695
Hideaway

638
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:10,559
Tim would tell Alex about the traffic that came to the website and Alex decides

639
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,583
What to do about it

640
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:14,143
I would tell him if

641
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,959
They're letting you know it's it like

642
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:20,543
The more people that are in Town Square the more people that are going into the shops

643
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:25,407
So just by default the more people going to the news website

644
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,711
I mean you're going to pick up

645
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:31,807
Traffic coming over to the store because we had banner ads running

646
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,071
Now

647
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:48,703
Audience members infowars.com

648
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,031
Right

649
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:52,799
Yes

650
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:55,871
He wanted to talk about

651
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,175
Correct

652
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,735
As you

653
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:22,239
Email before you

654
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:28,127
Listen to you dated March 11th 2016

655
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:31,967
Yes

656
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,575
And

657
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:43,487
Chris Ellison was the e-commerce manager for a certain. Of time

658
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,399
Yes he reported to me

659
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,215
And

660
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,055
Email

661
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,663
Infowars.com

662
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,711
It was just

663
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:07,295
And Chris is doing boy there

664
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:12,927
Know Chris was gone Chris has gone for quite a while now

665
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:17,535
He is sending you an email

666
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:23,679
Oh that's not

667
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:24,959
Yes

668
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,263
Hellboy

669
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:31,359
We saw the largest traffic Spike ever

670
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:35,967
On March 11th 2016

671
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,855
Yes

672
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,423
Yesterday we capped out at

673
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,543
So we got a giant spiky

674
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:04,895
The biggest Spike that has ever been recorded according to this email

675
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:07,967
And we already also have an understanding that

676
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:10,271
You know Tim would report these things

677
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:16,671
To Alex you should be aware of this and seems to not really beat the I don't know

678
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:21,279
Your email about that stuff

679
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,071
So we can little bit more into the email here

680
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,471
Largest spider ever

681
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,039
Yes

682
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,695
Activity

683
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,495
Yes or no

684
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:07,871
So if there was a big news day if there was a big story

685
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:12,991
For whatever that CNN Fox drudge everybody was covering

686
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,527
It would

687
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:20,927
Send more traffic to imports.com which in turn would send more craft Imports store

688
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:31,423
Mr. Jones

689
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:34,495
Play result in additional traffic

690
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,287
Common site

691
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,615
Yes I mean

692
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,895
Scrap

693
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:48,063
Tim tries to play some little what if games

694
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,855
Sometimes it's just

695
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:54,719
It's bad traffic not getting increased sales and stuff

696
00:46:54,975 --> 00:47:01,119
The maybe it's DDOS attack maybe who knows

697
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:01,887
Traffic

698
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:04,703
So here is where he tries to pull something that okay

699
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,543
Largest traffic Spike ever

700
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:17,247
Well if not yes then took cool thing I would

701
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:19,551
Tell him hey largest bike ever

702
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:25,183
I don't remember this but if I'm looking at this and I'm putting myself back in 2016

703
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:28,511
He's telling me that there was a large

704
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,303
Largest spider ever

705
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:33,631
That didn't contribute to sales

706
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,959
And if you scroll down and look at that map

707
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:40,287
Screenshot he sent

708
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:43,615
That would tell me that we were being attacked on the store

709
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,687
Because it happened all the time

710
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,223
Where

711
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:53,343
Whatever players whoever players would send Bots and

712
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,671
All kinds of stuff to try and Spike the traffic up

713
00:47:57,183 --> 00:48:00,255
On the stored over on the server to bring the store down

714
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:02,815
That happens all the time so

715
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:08,447
If I am looking at this today and putting myself in my shoes from 2016

716
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,775
I would say that's the point that is means

717
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,567
Is trying to be made is

718
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:16,895
Hey something weird happened this could be an attack

719
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:30,463
Yeah that would think Matthew I would say we got a ton of traffic

720
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,047
Okay

721
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:40,447
I guess I guess that's what it was but I guess and it drove Bunch traffic

722
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:46,847
Crispy Gold Spike person not see that in the news

723
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:49,919
Email is

724
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:52,479
I mean here's the thing that I feel like

725
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:53,759
Tim does not

726
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,039
Alright

727
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:59,903
Is if you're going to try and avoid the question in the positive of like

728
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,951
I know what he covered

729
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:05,023
And therefore we adjusted things according

730
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,047
Right

731
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,863
That is essentially a true false

732
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,935
Right if you also say we know when it's

733
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:12,703
False

734
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:14,495
That means you know when it

735
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,031
It's true so if you say

736
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:19,615
Well we figured out when it wasn't a DDOS attack

737
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:23,711
Means you know when it was something else and conceivably you're like

738
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:30,111
Maybe you don't remember this cuz it was years in the past moment you were digging into this

739
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:35,487
Trying to understand the traffic explaining it away is a DDOS attack

740
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,023
It reveals

741
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:39,071
You know investigation exactly

742
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:43,167
Yes and that that is that isn't heavily implied there

743
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,703
But yeah it wasn't

744
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,007
Now that was just

745
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,615
In 2016

746
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:54,431
How much do you think Infowars was making per week

747
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,455
Ringing in

748
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,223
Oh my

749
00:49:56,479 --> 00:50:02,623
God I don't want an so I mean I did hear the one number they tossed out was like almost half a billion.

750
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,391
Dollars one year

751
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:05,695
Right so you got to figure that puts yet

752
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,999
What 100,000 a week

753
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,047
Well here's where we were

754
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:15,935
You have

755
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:18,495
Army

756
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:33,855
Oh s*** wasn't no a million presidential things

757
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:37,951
Because

758
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:42,047
You believe that the existence of the presidential race

759
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:45,375
Contributed to an increase in your weekly Revenue

760
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:50,751
Well I mean everyone was it's the presidential cycle I would assume

761
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:53,823
That's what it is I couldn't tell you definitively but

762
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,359
That's what makes sense to me

763
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,551
Infowars

764
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:05,087
Store.com

765
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,647
Wewe average revenue

766
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:09,183
2016

767
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:14,303
I don't recall a company show me but

768
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:15,839
I don't remember

769
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:30,431
Wait for it wait for it

770
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:36,319
There's a cameo coming

771
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:53,727
Free Speech system dearly days

772
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:58,335
Pump-action

773
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,735
Ballpark is Bean

774
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:31,103
Corporate representative

775
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:34,943
Absolutely

776
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:49,535
Oh my God

777
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:50,815
Oh my God

778
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:54,143
Humane one of you

779
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,423
Oh my God

780
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:02,335
Hide for the court reporter please note that

781
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:03,359
Addis

782
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,663
While I'm gone

783
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:12,063
Yeah yeah yeah yeah just logged on his only appearance at all in this deposition

784
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:16,927
Is as somebody who's accidentally streaming to

785
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:24,095
I love it I need to bring up that Norma lost his ability to correct

786
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:28,191
Does law for 6 months

787
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:34,335
Yeah yeah I mean it's tough it's tough to him to call his bottom feeders if you're stealing our B man that's

788
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:40,735
That's kind of harsh tweeted something about a gravy job that's pretty

789
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:42,783
Norbit it's funny because

790
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:47,135
The number of people he is fooling is precisely zero

791
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:53,535
0 people were like oh see he's got a cool enough sense of humor that he could expand and

792
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:57,631
You were trying buddy you're trying to deflect

793
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:04,031
Yeah but

794
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:05,055
I love this

795
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,335
Kind of

796
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:08,639
Fame with Norm where he's like

797
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:12,735
Just the guy who fumbles onto the scene

798
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:16,831
Showing up at the deposition like this was just it was it was delightful

799
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:19,135
Also you can see forshee laughing

800
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:26,815
Tim doesn't take dorm seriously hyperchicken lawyer from Futurama

801
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:33,983
Every there is the point where it in Futurama there's the point where the chicken lawyer

802
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:36,799
Is talking to to fry and then

803
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:41,663
The reveal is the lawyer himself was in prison the entire time I was like that's

804
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:45,759
Prison giving you legal advice

805
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:52,415
And also like a can you help me get out of here I didn't pose Bale presumably

806
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:55,231
Decide to double dip watch it Tuesday

807
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:58,815
Irene the funniest part do the funniest part what elevates it is

808
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:00,607
Is B the audio is

809
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:07,007
Somebody saying that the corporate representative should be prepared I believe it's the judge in the Texas

810
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:13,407
Corporate representative should be prepared is absolutely the best at end of course that's what should be

811
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:15,199
See you there man beautiful

812
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:19,295
It's and there's also a native comedy that he seems to not be able to

813
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:22,111
Mutant right away can't figure it out

814
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,439
Something was going on before that

815
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:30,559
After the million in sales a week right which Tim is trying to attribute to the

816
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:36,447
Dunno the election year

817
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:40,031
One of the things that's fascinating is all of these people at Infowars

818
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:42,335
There's every single one of them to a person

819
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:46,431
Engages in improvisational explanation

820
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:53,087
They're presented with a set of facts and they're like here's why

821
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:58,975
Balls out every single one of these people I don't understand what I wrote down is like

822
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:01,791
You can you should be able to hear at this point like

823
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:03,327
Oh this is a question

824
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,607
You know the answer to

825
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:11,007
And you are asking it to me I would like you to just tell me the answer and then I'll agree with what you say

826
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:13,311
Is Drew if I'm allowed to talk

827
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:15,871
I'm going to make up some b******* that's just who I am

828
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:22,271
Tim is a little bit more of a serious person at Ryan's but he still has that to that trait that to Habit

829
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:28,159
It's very weird enough time at the year for his office you're going to make up reasons for any

830
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:34,559
So we talked about this at the beginning of the notion of Alex doing pay-for-play

831
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:35,327
Play kind of stuff

832
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:37,119
Answer this comes back up

833
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:56,575
So advertise sorry can you

834
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:59,903
Repeat the question sorry

835
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:16,031
Two, who wanted to come on this

836
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:23,199
That is not

837
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,735
So black-and-white

838
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:29,087
So he would charge advertisers

839
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:34,719
To mention their products and stuff on the air

840
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:38,559
Ray can't remember him

841
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:41,887
Charging a guest to come on the air

842
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,055
Just beautiful

843
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,079
Just

844
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:56,479
When when there's live me show you this never it never

845
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:57,759
Never stops

846
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:58,783
It's just there

847
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:05,183
Yeah that was information that Tim is volunteering that is going to be contradicted by the next week

848
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:07,487
Need to say

849
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:10,559
Say I have never been aware of Alex

850
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:13,631
I asked you for money to have people appear on the Shelf

851
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:17,727
Mount saying that you charges to mention a product

852
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:19,775
So that is is one thing

853
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:25,663
It's another so black-and-white to call it in that it's fine to take ads

854
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,943
It's fine to do that

855
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:33,343
It's fine to have you know brokered content that's kind of revealed as such sure it is not ethical

856
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,903
To have people come on

857
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,183
Who are paying

858
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:43,583
To have an interview with you as if it's a normal interview that is promoting their product that

859
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:45,119
Is kind of messed up

860
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:46,399
And

861
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:49,983
Here's an email of Tim trying to sell exactly

862
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:58,175
An email from you to

863
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:03,039
July 29th 2014

864
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:20,447
That you are informing Mr eduire

865
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:24,799
Acosta

866
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,455
Desperate

867
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:50,143
Someone with Bonner and partners

868
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:51,935
Alright

869
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:55,263
Further

870
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:06,015
It is email

871
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:12,927
He said next week

872
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:21,631
Meaning

873
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,959
They talked about

874
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,111
Yes

875
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:56,959
Between 15 and $20,000 tip

876
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:04,639
He usually charges I mean that's

877
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:10,783
If I am putting myself back in 2014 Alex asked me to write to him

878
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:17,183
To basically let him know the value of him coming onto the show

879
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:23,583
Good good good good save SolidWorks time

880
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,631
This is just trying to make sure he

881
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:32,031
That was one of the ghetto I almost

882
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:38,687
It's normally charges 15 to $20,000 for this because he likes he's going to do this as a freebie

883
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:47,391
Yeah everything I do better. I think it's just trying to make this guy appreciate

884
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:50,975
Feel special

885
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:57,375
That is just as psycho is Daria being like well don't they feel nice about hearing that their kids might still be a

886
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:00,703
Instapsycho crazy got to push back

887
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:03,775
I think that Daria is way more

888
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:10,175
Much more hurtful when I said it out loud I realized that I had gone farther than I text

889
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:12,735
Disconnected from like what

890
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:16,063
Normal people would species going on

891
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:18,879
Introduces like a

892
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:19,903
Really

893
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:21,439
F*****-up kind of

894
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:23,999
Thing into Alex's world because

895
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:30,399
If you know that this is something that he does then you can't really be sure that any of the interviews that he does

896
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:35,263
How much of it is stuff that he actually believes in how much of it is stuff that he would promote

897
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:41,407
Just his own accord and how much of it is he getting paid 20 grand

898
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:47,807
To just have a little conversation with this person it's free money on the table and who's getting suckered you

899
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:54,207
The Listener it goes It goes from being like a Rush Limbaugh clone show to being more like

900
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:55,999
An infomercial

901
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:58,559
2 a.m. trying to sell your knives except for

902
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:00,351
The people selling you knives are like

903
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:01,375
Well one

904
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:04,703
If you don't get this knife everyone you know is going to die

905
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:11,103
And to this person selling knives as maybe the greatest knife salesman that ever existed there their best nights you know

906
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:13,151
Knife infomercials are fun

907
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:19,551
Cotton books

908
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:22,111
I really think that this is something

909
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:23,647
That is

910
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:26,719
H-E-B a big problem

911
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:32,863
For Alex's listeners even if they are people who are like staunch believer in this stuff

912
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,399
Because introducing

913
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:38,751
This kind of doubt into the things that you are seeing on his show

914
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:41,055
It should really make you question

915
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:47,455
Stop you even if only twice in the course of his career people actually paid him $20,000

916
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:48,991
It's still

917
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:50,015
Is

918
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:51,295
It tarnishes

919
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:57,951
I'm pretty much every interview we can never be sure that it is above board and pure your currency in

920
01:03:58,207 --> 01:03:58,975
In a cult is

921
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:00,767
Infallible truck

922
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,559
But you know like

923
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:07,935
We will do anything that this person says because we completely trust them

924
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:09,983
And this should be

925
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:16,383
A tiny doubt should be the end for you you know you can't be an occult if you're not one hundred percent it

926
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:18,943
Yeah there should be an erosion of trust the gas when this

927
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:22,527
I probably won't swing there

928
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,063
Which was admirable

929
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,599
And it comes up with another swing

930
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:33,535
Ian

931
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,071
You are

932
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:46,847
And advertising proposal to which Free Speech systems will receive $46,550

933
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:47,871
Or

934
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:49,663
Different ad placements related

935
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:59,135
Alex Winter

936
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:10,399
Wow

937
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:15,775
Where we going here buddy call me the number that Alex gave me

938
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:21,151
But that's a typical sales pitch of hey I'm we're going to give you a value

939
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,687
This

940
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:25,759
To come on the show if you do this

941
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:33,183
That's the way I'm reading it I honestly don't remember this cuz it was so long ago I'm just trying to and don't ask me how my first

942
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:39,583
But yeah I mean obviously wrote it there and usually charges

943
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:44,959
15/20 it's giving an incentive for him to buy the ad package for 49,000

944
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:51,615
You're basically saying

945
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:54,943
Ask you to purchase ads

946
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:59,807
Website

947
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:01,087
4

948
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:08,511
That's what it reads yes

949
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:13,375
Turn up Selma Wild

950
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:18,239
Okay I get what you're saying I get what you say

951
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:24,639
It's not like the warranty package is what drives us man with give you a free warranty that's a sweeten the pie

952
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:31,039
What you know is really about giving you a valium

953
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:34,111
Ironically

954
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:36,415
Bill Bonner is somebody who like

955
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,183
Alex

956
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:38,463
Should have on

957
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:40,255
They shouldn't need to extort him

958
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:46,655
He's like a guy who wrote for the loo Rockwell is a Libertarian type conservative

959
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:49,471
Finance

960
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,495
For a book

961
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:55,615
If you can afford a budget of 60 K and advertising that book is

962
01:06:55,871 --> 01:07:02,015
Probably going to do that book better be doing well by the 46 that you don't have to pay the 15

963
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:08,415
That's fine if you got 50 cases to sell on your book 46 it's a big difference I hope you make it back

964
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,183
I hope you do

965
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:10,719
It's

966
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:13,023
I don't believe this either though.

967
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:19,423
Closer than his first explanation I think to be unbelievable

968
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:22,495
That they open with a 15 to 20

969
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:25,823
And then somebody goes like

970
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,639
That's the most money we've ever accepted before we'll take it

971
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:29,663
I think

972
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:32,479
I think

973
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:37,087
That he probably has a situation where he charges this

974
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:39,135
For people to come on

975
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:44,255
But also uses like an offer to try and

976
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:48,351
Cell if possible so I think I think that these are both

977
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:54,751
Probably true there's like a pay-to-play thing at that also it is used to induce people into these laws

978
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:56,031
Larger packages

979
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:59,103
Of even so it is still

980
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:00,639
Like the same issue remains

981
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:04,223
All of it but it's and that's almost even more

982
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:05,759
Damning again because that's

983
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,295
That's business

984
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:09,855
You know that's people who have a business plan

985
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:10,879
Who acts

986
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:11,903
In terms of

987
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:18,303
What we do to maximize profit which is exactly the opposite of the way Alex likes to present himself

988
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:19,071
Which is the proper

989
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:19,839
You betcha

990
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:25,727
So Alex has taken this money conceivably anytime he's promoted something

991
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:30,079
He's never told the audience adina's

992
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:33,151
Are you aware of Dallas ever telling his audience

993
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:35,967
He had on

994
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:42,367
No

995
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:55,167
Content

996
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:06,175
13 repeat

997
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,815
Not that I recall

998
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,095
Well

999
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:25,887
Why would you

1000
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:33,055
This is something that come up over and over and over again like in these depositions in my head I'm always like

1001
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:35,103
His next question is going to be like

1002
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:36,895
You realize that's bad right

1003
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:40,735
That doesn't happen

1004
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:45,343
Okay you just said the things that you said you realize those are bad

1005
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:52,767
Place to scold

1006
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,303
Utility

1007
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:56,351
That's shady as hell

1008
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:58,399
No children would be disappointed

1009
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:01,471
Did you write you understand this

1010
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:08,127
I think that there are you know with one of the things that strange but Alex's show is that there are instances

1011
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:09,407
Sentence of times where you can

1012
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:14,783
Kind of tell that something is brokered programming gas but the line is gray a lot of the time

1013
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:15,551
And that

1014
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:19,135
Even for me somebody who's watching with a critical eye and looking

1015
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:20,415
Looking into the

1016
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,183
Stuff like

1017
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:23,487
Sometimes it is

1018
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:25,535
Difficult to tell

1019
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:28,095
Introduction of this

1020
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:31,935
Into the possibility the range of possibilities yeah

1021
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:36,031
It makes me think whenever it's gray it's probably pay

1022
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:41,407
That's not good I mean it's h22a weird level

1023
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:42,687
It's it's like

1024
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:47,039
He's almost scamming scammers with this scam

1025
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:49,087
Scamming the scammer

1026
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:50,367
Getting them

1027
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:52,159
And then scamming his audience like you

1028
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:58,559
You taking it from the top and the bottom Willie it certainly tends to make sense of why there are certain people

1029
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:04,959
Who show up for a little while and then aren't figures they purchased a package

1030
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:11,359
MLB package is good for 3 months totally was a big figure

1031
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:12,383
While and then

1032
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:18,783
I haven't I don't know where he is and then they found out that the advertising budget was too much for that

1033
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:25,183
Mike cernovich was on quite a bit pretty regularly and then was gone for a while

1034
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:27,743
I don't know if that's

1035
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:31,071
Don't necessarily what's going on but I wouldn't be too surprised

1036
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:32,095
I mean

1037
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:35,679
True true

1038
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:38,239
So speaking of things that are expensive

1039
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,775
Buying Alex's product

1040
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:42,335
Not expensive Alex buying it

1041
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,103
Yes

1042
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:49,503
So did the product line that Alex launched called amerex Essentials comes up and

1043
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:55,647
This is like the deodorant and body wash and threaten to turn for men

1044
01:11:55,903 --> 01:12:01,791
He's trying to turn this into a like a you're going to buy this stuff anyway buy it for me as well kind of

1045
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:02,559
It didn't work

1046
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:05,375
They made a lot of money initially

1047
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:08,191
And then people just we're not interested

1048
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:11,007
In this next clip we learn a little bit about the mark-up

1049
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:12,543
On Emirates Essentials

1050
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:21,503
Revenue for 96

1051
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:28,415
Yes

1052
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:35,583
In

1053
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:39,423
Was

1054
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:40,959
104.

1055
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:45,311
A cell yes

1056
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:47,103
4A

1057
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:50,431
Profit in that two week period of 359

1058
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:52,223
Elementary menus

1059
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:53,759
Pearson

1060
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:59,903
400%

1061
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:04,255
On that particular line

1062
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:05,535
Injection

1063
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:07,583
I mean

1064
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:11,935
The number there it appears that

1065
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:14,495
I'm not sure about 40% I can't do that math

1066
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:16,031
But that

1067
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:18,335
Tropic appears there it looks right

1068
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:20,127
That's pretty damn good.

1069
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:25,247
Very good Alex does like a 60% also still like marked up

1070
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:30,623
At least like 150 percent

1071
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:31,903
Man

1072
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:33,183
That's good

1073
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:34,463
If you can get it

1074
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:40,863
Boy yeah I mean the markup on hearing aids for the longest time was

1075
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:42,911
Anywhere between two-and-a-half to three and a half

1076
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:47,775
You know and that made sense for a lot of businesses cuz they're all

1077
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:49,055
Mortars you know like

1078
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:52,127
It's all over head and shittin you got to do the whole thing

1079
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:53,663
That's that's what the business

1080
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:54,687
This had to do to survive

1081
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:59,551
You know it was the it was the companies making the cartel level money

1082
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:00,831
But I also would

1083
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:03,903
Guess that in this instance

1084
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:04,671
Some

1085
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:11,071
Higher markup makes sense because the purchases are lesser other scare sir

1086
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:12,607
Time purchase or like

1087
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:15,935
Maybe once every few years or whatever

1088
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:22,335
So I feel like a markup on that in order for these businesses to even be able to do survive that makes

1089
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:26,687
Where is the Kia auto ship in Lake routine purchases

1090
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:30,271
Black level of a markup for something that you're going to be buying

1091
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:33,343
More and more and more like regularly

1092
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:34,111
That's

1093
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:36,415
Let me try and put it to you this way

1094
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:39,231
That markup was there because the total

1095
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:41,791
Profit on each one of those was like

1096
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:43,071
10%

1097
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:46,143
You know like of the total amount anybody spent

1098
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:48,191
You get a little bit as your profit

1099
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:48,959
Not

1100
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:50,751
400 f****** percent

1101
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:52,799
Yeah the actual sale that's

1102
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:54,079
That price gouging

1103
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:55,615
Yeah yeah

1104
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:04,063
Thievery feels very out of sync with the way that Alex describes

1105
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:10,463
Bible taking a loss on this

1106
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:13,279
It's on 400% profit I'm only getting 300

1107
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:14,559
Cool

1108
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:18,143
So Tim was involved in ad sales

1109
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:19,167
For a little while

1110
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:20,191
Yeah and

1111
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:23,007
You know for a bit he hated it though

1112
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:29,407
They imagine that is not especially it Infowars probably not the most pleasurable

1113
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:31,199
Because you end up like

1114
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:32,223
Selling

1115
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:33,503
Ads for

1116
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:35,295
Unscrupulous businesses

1117
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:37,087
Remember that

1118
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:38,367
Email

1119
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,647
We were discussing

1120
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:40,415
Earlier

1121
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:42,719
Where

1122
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:46,559
Barbie

1123
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:02,175
Email from Yahoo

1124
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:05,247
If you go

1125
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,135
To the

1126
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:14,975
Is emailing

1127
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:37,247
The website

1128
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:50,047
Yes

1129
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:55,423
Was

1130
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,287
The Proposal that you offered him would be to

1131
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:09,503
The pier so

1132
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:16,159
So I looked into it a tiny bit and self lender itself doesn't seem like it's one of the most Shady biz

1133
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,439
Genesis in the world like

1134
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:19,231
They think that there are

1135
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:21,535
Instances where this can be

1136
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:27,679
Something like Sloan-Kettering something that is helpful for people to build credit but it also is not

1137
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:29,471
Necessarily

1138
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:34,335
Always the best thing to do not necessarily always safe for folks

1139
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:37,151
It's not

1140
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:39,199
It and said something that I feel like Alex

1141
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:39,967
Audience

1142
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:41,247
It doesn't seem like a

1143
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:46,111
I think to offer any any Finance thing

1144
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:47,903
If they give you a good offer

1145
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:48,671
Alright

1146
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:54,303
That means that you have to adhere to every say it like there's their offers are deviled like

1147
01:17:54,559 --> 01:18:00,703
Like you follows a riddle a perfectly and it works out you f****** one time

1148
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:01,983
There you're there

1149
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:07,103
Oh I'm sorry the fee is $7000000 and also you work for us now

1150
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:12,991
Good deal then it's a great deal for them

1151
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:19,391
They're not doing this out of a desire to get you out of debt or get you out of bad credit that's not what

1152
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:25,791
Like the whole world has good credit at the end of their business

1153
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:30,911
Cashing places don't want to cash checks for people they don't love cashing check

1154
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:32,703
So I mean

1155
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:37,311
This is something that I find to be a little bit

1156
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:44,735
As an advertising gambling would be worse right

1157
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:51,135
It's A Step Above today we have Timmy the bookie over here and he's going to advertise on bedding

1158
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:52,671
A lot of money on a losing team

1159
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:58,047
So he can break your kneecaps later in terms of things that Alex has promoted though like maybe it's not

1160
01:18:58,303 --> 01:19:01,887
The words that mean yes I have been ads on his chauffeur called

1161
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:10,847
One of the Vibes that you get

1162
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:13,407
Is the Tim does not

1163
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:14,175
Care

1164
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:18,783
He is not interested in the infowar

1165
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:21,343
And maybe doesn't even actually like Alex at my

1166
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:27,743
Describing on the show

1167
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:31,071
What was Publix on nipple wards.com website

1168
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:35,167
Conversations with mr.

1169
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:37,727
No

1170
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:41,567
No I didn't talk to Alex about

1171
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:43,871
Newser his show

1172
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:45,151
That wasn't

1173
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:47,455
I didn't care about that

1174
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:49,503
My bad that wasn't

1175
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:51,039
My job

1176
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:53,599
Nano

1177
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:57,183
You had no idea what he's talking about on show

1178
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:57,951
Bike ride

1179
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:01,279
I mean some days if yes maybe but most days

1180
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:04,351
I made it a point not to listen to a show

1181
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:06,655
Because it was too distracting

1182
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:10,239
The website did you read the website

1183
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:18,688
I don't know about everyday but most

1184
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:24,064
He seems like a guy who wandered in one day and just stuck around

1185
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:28,928
No you're outside

1186
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:35,328
Alex is on his show yelling about how he's in a war against the f****** devil

1187
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:41,728
And stoking hatred against marginalized and vulnerable populations yet constantly

1188
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:42,496
Today

1189
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:49,152
F*** you with your I don't watch his just sometimes and sometimes it look at it

1190
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:54,016
What a gesture weasel

1191
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:57,088
Oh my God so this is kind of funny okay

1192
01:20:57,344 --> 01:21:01,184
Maddie asks why he doesn't watch Alex's show

1193
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:03,488
So distracting

1194
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:10,912
I really have to answer that question

1195
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:17,568
Alex's voice can get me

1196
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:23,712
And I don't officially agree with a lot of what he says

1197
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:29,856
Yeah

1198
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:34,464
I don't want to hear his show his voice is annoying and I don't agree with the stuff he says

1199
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:35,488
Oh my God

1200
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:38,304
That is f*****

1201
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,096
Baddie dark.

1202
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:41,376
The dark

1203
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:48,032
That's some real worm s*** well the paycheck was good

1204
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:54,176
That's no I know and that's why I have this feeling that like I think he's maybe

1205
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:55,456
He knows better

1206
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:59,808
Oh yeah the other people are True Believers and where they don't know any better

1207
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:03,136
Money money drives people crazy

1208
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:05,440
Yeah wanting money is nut

1209
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:06,720
You know like

1210
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:09,536
But it's I have no sympathy

1211
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:15,424
I'm just marking on the phenomena that money can itself be is a form of wage slavery you know like

1212
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:17,728
He can't not be in that

1213
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:19,008
Money-making range

1214
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:21,568
You know it's so Central to his identity

1215
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:27,456
I don't know about that maybe it is maybe it's not I don't know much about him outside of the things that I've gleaned from

1216
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:31,040
Hearing about him over the course of the time doing the show

1217
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:32,832
And this deposition but like

1218
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:35,392
I have to assume

1219
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,976
That if you don't like the sound of this person's voice

1220
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:41,280
You seem to not like him that much as a person

1221
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:45,632
You don't like his show you think the things that he covers you disagree with

1222
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,192
If you've been there for a decade it's money

1223
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:54,848
There's no other way there you're making more money than you would elsewhere so you make

1224
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:57,408
You make peace with the fact that you're

1225
01:22:57,664 --> 01:23:03,808
Basically your position is facilitating somebody to be a demagogue screaming

1226
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:06,368
You don't agree with it

1227
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:10,976
Unfortunate that this is the word that needs to be used here but he is a f****** Renfield

1228
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:17,632
The irony Bono

1229
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:28,384
So the question comes up about whether or not Tim had any feelings about Sandy Hook

1230
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,408
Being fake

1231
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,944

01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:14,720
In

1247
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:18,048
You never suspected that

1248
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,840
United States government

1249
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:21,632
Was somehow involved in

1250
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,192
Staging for spanking that event

1251
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:25,728
That's

1252
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:28,032
Never had a doubt

1253
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:30,080
And also was fine

1254
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:36,480
Taking money and working for a guy who is demonizing the parents of those murdered children that I was

1255
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:40,320
Very aware and convinced and certain actually were murder

1256
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:43,136
This is the type of f****** like

1257
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:49,792
This is the interviews in a crime documentary about the mafia where they black out that you can't see it

1258
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:51,072
His face and he's just like

1259
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:57,472
Yeah we murdered people left and right you know you know you told you get told the murderer Caillou go murder him and then you go home to your wife

1260
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:58,496
I know you like that

1261
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:04,896
That's not okay ma'am you're told to run the online store for a guy was Albion real

1262
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:06,688
Piece of s*** Master you do it

1263
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:13,088
Well well I mean I didn't I didn't like murdering that guy it's not my idea you know but I was told to do it I didn't like her

1264
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:15,648
Harassing those families for you know decades but

1265
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:20,000
You know you can you do what you told you just look the other way

1266
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:23,584
Look the other way man has

1267
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,120
Not been able to do that

1268
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:27,168
No that's why we're unsuccessful

1269
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:33,824
Well I mean yeah we're not successful on that level correct

1270
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,872
It's the word I meant

1271
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:37,664
Dark to me

1272
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:44,064
The notion of being intimately involved in this company to the point where you're the business director and you've

1273
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:47,392
Been there you're the seventh person Alex's higher probably

1274
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:51,232
Maybe one or two of those people are still around

1275
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:54,304
At this point 2014 or whatever

1276
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,328
And yours like

1277
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:56,608
Hey

1278
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:01,472
This sucks that shooting did happen Alex is saying all this crazy nonsense

1279
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:02,496
Oh well

1280
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:03,264
I don't care

1281
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:06,592
But how can it not be a big problem for you

1282
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:11,456
That's the thing you know I can understand everybody else because I understand believers

1283
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:16,832
At least you know I get belief yes I understand that if you truly believe

1284
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:23,232
Then it is not an ethical problem for you to be a part of this system because you do not believe it is unethical

1285
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:24,768
But for this

1286
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:25,536
This

1287
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:29,888
Don't understand I don't understand just being like Oh yeah I know what I'm doing is wrong

1288
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:31,168
But

1289
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:34,752
$200,000 well here's the disconnect

1290
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:38,336
He probably doesn't think they're what he's doing is wrong

1291
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:44,736
I believe that he is a morally neutral piece within an immoral system or something like what

1292
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:45,760
Alex's doing is wrong

1293
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:46,784
What I'm doing

1294
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,320
This is money man

1295
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:49,600
And that

1296
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:51,392
Fox Berkshire

1297
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:54,208
We didn't care for what I was doing on there that's for sure

1298
01:26:58,048 --> 01:27:00,352
Contact with

1299
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:03,168
Overtime mr. Jones

1300
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:06,752
Featuring

1301
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:08,800
Premonition

1302
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:14,176
No I don't recall that I know that

1303
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:15,968
I

1304
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:17,248
Personally thought it was

1305
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:18,784
Not

1306
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:19,552
Right

1307
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:20,576
For him to do it

1308
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:23,136
But

1309
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:26,720
No again I never listen to show

1310
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:28,768
I don't really care

1311
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:30,304
What he did on the

1312
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:36,960
I didn't know I wasn't aware I didn't care but also I thought what he was doing was bad it was wrong of him to do that

1313
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:38,496
Where

1314
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:40,288
Really weird strange

1315
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:41,056
Yep

1316
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:45,408
Hitler's housekeeper band like what

1317
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:46,432
Blissey

1318
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:52,064
I don't know what he was doing out that a lot of dust

1319
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:53,344
Hideous

1320
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:54,624
That's all I know about

1321
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:57,440
If you do the other things it kind of

1322
01:27:57,696 --> 01:28:03,072
Drum stands out is that like there were people who had a problem with this

1323
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:04,096
And there is

1324
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:06,912
Demonstrable evidence that they said something about

1325
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:10,240
People I call Joseph Watson Rob Jacobson

1326
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:14,336
There's both of them there confirmable

1327
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:17,664
Instances of them having a problem with his coverage

1328
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,200
And speaking up

1329
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:19,968
Yep

1330
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:22,528
Temperature today is somebody who is

1331
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:24,064
Claiming videos

1332
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,368
I didn't believe this stuff but

1333
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:27,648
He didn't care

1334
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:30,720
Nope he didn't care did not give a s***

1335
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:31,488
Yeah

1336
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:33,792
That is some that

1337
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:36,864
I'm real f*****-up s*** right there man

1338
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:41,216
Answer he's asked why he had a problem with what Alex was doing

1339
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:43,776
And he struggles to answer that

1340
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:45,312
I don't find this compelling

1341
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:52,480
General weirdness

1342
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,696
This program

1343
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:08,096
Injection

1344
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:10,144
I don't know

1345
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:13,728
About all the details but I know he was talking about it

1346
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,520
You understand why we're here

1347
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,824
I mean

1348
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,104
What did you consider

1349
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:23,968
Well I mean I just said something you don't

1350
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:25,248
Don't talk about

1351
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:26,016
Stop.

1352
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,576
That's what you got

1353
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:30,880
It's just

1354
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:32,416
No

1355
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:34,720
It's not something

1356
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:39,072
Because there's nothing wrong

1357
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:40,352
National

1358
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:45,216
I don't know what he

1359
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:49,824
Bills or thinks but me personally you know it was

1360
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:50,848
A tragedy

1361
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,896
And it's not something

1362
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:58,272
That you cover it the day when it's in the main news and then you go on

1363
01:29:58,528 --> 01:30:00,064
That's what I personally would have done

1364
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:02,624
And you know I just

1365
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:08,768
Talk about it

1366
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:09,792
Warriors

1367
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:14,656
Denied it.

1368
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:21,056
Generally I don't recall specifically but most likely and yes

1369
01:30:21,824 --> 01:30:22,336
Okay

1370
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:28,736
I find her to be a another improvised excuse type answers

1371
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:30,272
You can't even

1372
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:35,136
Articulate why the thing is a problem for you

1373
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:38,464
Which leads me to believe that he doesn't care

1374
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:42,560
Yeah it's not really that you don't actually really have a problem

1375
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:44,864
You know you're supposed to

1376
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:47,424
Unlikely

1377
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:49,216
I would have done it that way

1378
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:50,752
But you know

1379
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,800
People do things

1380
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:54,592
That's your response

1381
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:55,872
You're in

1382
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:57,152
There should be things

1383
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:58,432
That you go

1384
01:30:58,688 --> 01:30:59,712
This cannot be

1385
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:06,112
The irreconcilable between you and I and I am a I am a fundamental part of this operation

1386
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:07,648
This workplace

1387
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:09,184
This show

1388
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:10,208
Existing

1389
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:13,280
I am critical to it happening

1390
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:16,096
And I don't give a s***

1391
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:17,376
About the effect

1392
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:18,144
Fact that it has

1393
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,424
That's that's

1394
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:22,240
Even even under like the most

1395
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:24,032
Use of responsibilities

1396
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:28,384
It is due to your actions personally that these people work hard

1397
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:33,504
I'm such a blase attitude about it is just banana very bizarre

1398
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:38,624
Reply Quiet Riot Eva problem

1399
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:42,976
It's just not done not how you do things please please

1400
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:45,280
That first you must send a

1401
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:49,120
All right and then another letter of introduction through your second

1402
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:55,520
It's not how it's done in polite Society being whatever you've been watching about extreme and I think that Maddie was trying to hit on something

1403
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:58,080
Thing they are that would have been

1404
01:31:59,104 --> 01:32:01,408
Another question that Tim wouldn't answer put

1405
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:02,944
This must

1406
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:06,528
Have to do with how Alex was covering it is the problem

1407
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:08,064
What is the how

1408
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,600
That is the problem exactly

1409
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:12,416
If you say that you're uncomfortable with it

1410
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:13,184
What is

1411
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:19,584
Exactly are you talking about your answer determines how we go forward your answer being

1412
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:23,680
Alex was talking about this obviously isn't a problem because it's a news event

1413
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:24,704
Exactly cover

1414
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:25,472
Enzo

1415
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:28,544
Tim's attempt to be like well it's talking about it

1416
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:29,824
Longer

1417
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,384
That unfortunately reveals that if he

1418
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:36,992
Actually had a problem then he was aware that he'll accept talking about you

1419
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:42,368
And that kind of undercuts a lot of his pretending to like I don't even know what Alex is talking about

1420
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:45,696
Stop knowing when not something means you know when something

1421
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:46,720
Exactly

1422
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:49,792
So Tim disagrees Daleks maybe like

1423
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:51,584
Over half the time

1424
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:09,248
I agree with some of what he says

1425
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:12,576
But I don't agree with some of what he says

1426
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:16,416
But absolutely I agree with his right to say what

1427
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:17,440
He

1428
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:21,536
I don't agree with them about half the time

1429
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:22,816
Maybe more

1430
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:29,728
F****** Voltaire over here I don't agree with what you say

1431
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:31,776
What are what is thinker

1432
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:38,176
If I were somebody who was listening to Infowars and believing this stuff I would ask myself

1433
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:42,784
How it is possible that Alex is 7th employee who is his business manager

1434
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:45,856
Does not believe the s*** that he says on it I mean

1435
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:49,440
If the stuff that he's saying mean something and he's on a whole

1436
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:50,464
Crusade

1437
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:52,768
I would guess the

1438
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:54,560
The person who runs his business

1439
01:33:55,072 --> 01:34:01,216
Would be somebody somebody who's on board with the themes and the content of his show

1440
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:02,752
We sell is fervent

1441
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:11,456
That's what you're going for you ask ask these questions of yourself

1442
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:17,856
How is the baby number 2 number 3 person at Infowars somebody who doesn't believe Alex's s*** is real or

1443
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:20,416
Means anything I find fascinating

1444
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:21,696
That these are public

1445
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:28,096
Like now I need to I want to know more about the things that I participate in and whether or not there are people in that be

1446
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:30,656
Business who have given depositions that I should know about

1447
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:34,752
You know what I mean like I have time every time I buy a f******

1448
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:38,592
Tired or something should I be Googling whether or not a tight executive

1449
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:44,992
Was Joan telling obvious falsehoods about house tide actually kills people like what what don't I know

1450
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:49,600
Call about deposition

1451
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:53,952
You're never going to get out of this hole position hole

1452
01:34:54,464 --> 01:35:00,608
So the big article of course for Infowars traffic was the Adan Salazar

1453
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:06,752
Article the FBI reports no one died the sound of course

1454
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:07,776
Beretta

1455
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:09,824
Maybe

1456
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:10,592
Sure

1457
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:14,176
Cam

1458
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:15,968
Regarding the FBI's recording

1459
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:20,320
I don't remember

1460
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:23,136
I wouldn't

1461
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:27,232
Read not for me

1462
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:31,072
Not my style

1463
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:35,680
Well I mean yeah but just look at all this stuff I mean

1464
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:39,264
It's right there in writing it was obviously done so

1465
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:44,384
Any other Auto

1466
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:47,712
Baltimore traffic

1467
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:57,184
I do not recall being aware of that no

1468
01:35:57,952 --> 01:36:00,256
That's interesting because

1469
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:06,912
You're aware of all these fixing traffic seems like that's a big one you would be aware of

1470
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:09,472
Very noticeable even just from a

1471
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:15,872
Just scanning a grass yeah I do believe it is very possible that article and that's because he thinks

1472
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:20,224
Did everything they talked about his bulshit why would you waste your time reading this article

1473
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:26,624
It doesn't matter if she's interested for you to know what's going on waste

1474
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:33,024
I don't find this entertaining so it's not for me the FBI says no one died at Sandy Hook okay whatever

1475
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:39,424
I never had a doubt in my mind that the people died there is a normal for most people react

1476
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:45,312
Action upon I wouldn't read something like that

1477
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:47,360
I don't f****** work there

1478
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:50,944
Yeah I'm not the person who's involved with

1479
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:53,504
Monitoring traffic

1480
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:59,904
To the site and the store and this is one of the biggest traffic articles

1481
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:04,256
Easiest reason easiest reason this is absolute b******* is because

1482
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:05,536
If you were that guy

1483
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:08,352
Your job is to find out what it is

1484
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:10,400
That cause that huge Spike

1485
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:13,984
And that also includes what is in the article that might have

1486
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:20,384
Contributed to that because also and emailed about the

1487
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:21,920
The article on the big spike I drive

1488
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:23,712
F****** camp

1489
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,272
He is one of the writers yes

1490
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:30,880
Work

1491
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:33,696
Not really

1492
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:35,744
Reproduction I'm not

1493
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:37,280
We have a pickleball League

1494
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:39,840
Yes

1495
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:43,424
Author of the article

1496
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:48,800
I was not aware of them

1497
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:15,936
Yes

1498
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:21,568
Email blast

1499
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:24,896
Regarding

1500
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:26,688
Okay

1501
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:29,504
U-Haul

1502
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:38,720
Screenshot

1503
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:41,536
Alexa

1504
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:43,840
In Google analytics, correct

1505
01:38:44,608 --> 01:38:45,376
It appears some yes

1506
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:49,984
Correct

1507
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:52,032
Yeah I would be upon request

1508
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:55,360
No

1509
01:38:57,152 --> 01:38:59,200
F*** you now

1510
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:08,416
Pure something

1511
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:11,744
And what it shows

1512
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:15,840
Is a spike in traffic

1513
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:19,168
Around September 24th

1514
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:27,872
From the rest of the line on this

1515
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:29,664
Correct

1516
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:34,528
And this is the type of

1517
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:38,112
Earlier

1518
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:39,136
Where it

1519
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:49,376
I mean if I was something I noticed yes

1520
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:52,448
What what

1521
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:53,216
So far

1522
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:59,872
I can't say yes to this cuz then if I did then I'm making Alex aware of the GI

1523
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:07,040
In traffic that was due to this Sandy Hook hoax article no we already said that we try and reboot

1524
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:15,232
So are you yes or no maybe I don't know if I was if I was aware of it I did email the dawn Salazar this

1525
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:21,632
Starcraft that had a big spider

1526
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:31,872
There's something so attractive about that positions because I feel like any anybody who's ever been in an argument with

1527
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:34,432
With their partner or significant other whatever

1528
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:39,040
And they remember something different from you you know they're not lying to you

1529
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:43,136
But if you know you remember about it there's a party that's always wants to be like

1530
01:40:43,392 --> 01:40:43,904
You know what

1531
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:44,672
Let's go to the tape

1532
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:51,072
Let's see exactly what happened real quick I don't think you're going to like the way that it goes that is this to

1533
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:57,472
TV show you this email

1534
01:40:58,752 --> 01:41:00,544
Sneaky Fox

1535
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:03,104
They never have to be asked

1536
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:03,872
Follow-up Quest

1537
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:09,504
Know that it never comes up in like people like Alex in these because he works at Imports

1538
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:10,784
Their lives

1539
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:12,832
Do not involve follow-up questions

1540
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:14,880
They don't involve any difficult

1541
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:18,976
Positions at 8

1542
01:41:19,232 --> 01:41:20,256
Meticulously

1543
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:21,536
Alex

1544
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:22,304
Princeton

1545
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:27,936
Then I will take calls and say he'll take any critical call these hangs up on people yells over him

1546
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:30,752
To be in a position where you're forced

1547
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:31,520
To like

1548
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:33,568
Back cancer something but

1549
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:34,592
Well how about

1550
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:35,872
How about blank

1551
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:37,152
Is very fast

1552
01:41:37,408 --> 01:41:40,224
No they can't defend their actions under any kind of a dairy

1553
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:45,600
I should know in the until they're forced to retreat to improvisational excuse-making

1554
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:47,136
Very transparent

1555
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:48,416
Observer hand Bazaar

1556
01:41:49,184 --> 01:41:52,768
So Tim has said that they I would tell Alex about that

1557
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:53,792
If I noticed

1558
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:58,144
Here's a discussion that they have about how big this Spike was

1559
01:41:58,656 --> 01:42:00,960
Ask yourself if you think this guy would notice that

1560
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,016
I had a silly yes

1561
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:28,096
Between

1562
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:30,912
300 500 down

1563
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:40,128
1.75 million

1564
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:43,712
Practically the same height on a graph

1565
01:42:58,816 --> 01:42:59,328
Yes

1566
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:03,680
It seems like occurring at the same time

1567
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:06,240
Correct

1568
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:12,896
Yes

1569
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:14,176
And

1570
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:17,504
Spike's 2

1571
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:19,808
From what is

1572
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:22,112
Kind of a rolling average

1573
01:43:23,392 --> 01:43:27,488
1.3 to 1.5 million to just under three

1574
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:30,816
A selfie

1575
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:32,864
I mean it seems like a

1576
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:40,800
Pages

1577
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:55,648
Is from mid-september through October

1578
01:43:56,928 --> 01:43:57,440
Yes

1579
01:44:07,936 --> 01:44:10,240
Oh boy

1580
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:17,408
I I don't remember regularly looking at visitors purses

1581
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:24,064
Maybe the most important measurements of your continuing I couldn't tell you one way or the other to be closed on

1582
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:27,392
Who knows

1583
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:28,160
Can't

1584
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:30,208
Imagine a world

1585
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:33,792
Were you would ask him like hey is this

1586
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:34,816
Dick traffic

1587
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:38,656
The kind of thing you would notice ever him say no and Eddie believable

1588
01:44:38,912 --> 01:44:39,680
This is unnoticed

1589
01:44:39,936 --> 01:44:40,448
Right

1590
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:46,848
We're doing our total B dad so noticeable was it like unique viewers goes from 300,000 to 1

1591
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:51,968
1.75 million honestly honestly you know what

1592
01:44:52,224 --> 01:44:53,504
Chris can I call you Chris

1593
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:57,600
I agree that this seems a little bit unreasonable but I will tell you

1594
01:44:58,112 --> 01:45:04,256
I kind of took a nap that day it's on me I was asleep you emailed this to a Dom Salazar

1595
01:45:04,512 --> 01:45:08,864
Somebody broke into my email because I was falling asleep and I didn't want Alex to know he

1596
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:15,264
Can kind of be an a****** I don't know if you told you tell him that he's traffic is

1597
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:21,664
Part of that I don't want to be a part of that he could have reacted really negatively towards me you would have said Adam

1598
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:25,504
Boy at all this is so unbelievable like

1599
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:27,296
Vanilla

1600
01:45:27,552 --> 01:45:30,112
He is unaware of this is so

1601
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:32,416
Laughable we're we're in

1602
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:36,256
David what do you f****** do territory

1603
01:45:36,512 --> 01:45:38,304
Answer the goddamn question

1604
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:42,144
Now there is a sort of retreat

1605
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:42,912
But he couldn't

1606
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:44,192
And that is like

1607
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:46,240
This is traffic to the website

1608
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:51,872
I'm really more involved with the store no like I granted I monitor the traffic

1609
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:54,944
And stuff and how it relates to the traffic to the store

1610
01:45:55,456 --> 01:45:57,504
But you know I'm more focused on the store

1611
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:59,296
Unfortunately

1612
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:02,368
That Spike also was a seed in sale

1613
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:05,952
Spike like this

1614
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:06,976
In traffic

1615
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:09,280
Between September

1616
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:17,728
That would result in corresponding spike in Revenue

1617
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:23,360
Real quick this is a bit of a longer clip and also you probably are noticing now there's voices in the background

1618
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:30,016
Wherever Tim is broadcasting from or recording from those people talking in the hallway

1619
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:35,648
But yeah this is a bit of a longer clip just to preserve Conte

1620
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:38,464
Georgia

1621
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:40,768
Possibly

1622
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:45,632
But we you when we go to the report earlier that showed a spike and

1623
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:47,424
There was no cells I mean

1624
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:49,728
Who's worthless traffic so

1625
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:51,264
It just depends

1626
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:57,408
That's the tone of voice you want let's see

1627
01:46:57,664 --> 01:46:58,688
Let's see

1628
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:08,416
Ending to show you down

1629
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:17,120
Spreadsheet in front of you

1630
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:19,424
Okay

1631
01:47:25,568 --> 01:47:27,872
2010-2018

1632
01:47:33,504 --> 01:47:35,808
Barely but I do see it

1633
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:44,512
As the Director of Business operations

1634
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:46,304
Spreadsheet

1635
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,936
Am I correct

1636
01:47:57,312 --> 01:47:58,080
It appears so

1637
01:47:58,848 --> 01:48:02,176
But I will tell you I would not be familiar with the spreadsheet because

1638
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:03,200
I never looked at

1639
01:48:03,456 --> 01:48:06,016
Spreadsheets 3D card had a dashboard

1640
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:09,344
That I could log into and see and I

1641
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:12,672
They didn't have spreadsheets

1642
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:19,840
Daily sales

1643
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:23,168
It appears

1644
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:26,496
Dot-com

1645
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:31,616
Because evil.com website we got in operations

1646
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:33,152
That's correct

1647
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:41,088
In traffic cam

1648
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:45,696
The same date

1649
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:51,072
Third week in December of 2014

1650
01:48:56,448 --> 01:48:57,216

1652
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:03,104
Buscar September 23rd

1653
01:49:03,872 --> 01:49:08,224

1655
01:49:18,976 --> 01:49:20,768
September 25th

01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:27,936
Show the $1,000

1657
01:49:32,288 --> 01:49:33,312

1658
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:35,872
48000

1659
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:40,992
Yes

1660
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:43,552
September 26th

1661
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:45,344
Bee sting

1662
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:49,952
Slight

1663
01:49:56,096 --> 01:49:56,608
Correct

1664
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:04,032
Spike in Revenue

1665
01:50:08,896 --> 01:50:10,688
I would say that is

1666
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:11,456
Yes

1667
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:16,576
It depends because what is Worthy's Evergreen it is a spike yes

1668
01:50:17,088 --> 01:50:17,856
Thank you

1669
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:23,488
1230

1670
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:25,536
Yes you do

1671
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:30,400
Yes

1672
01:50:30,656 --> 01:50:36,800
If there's a new launch of a new product or that could also be the case but yeah

1673
01:50:37,056 --> 01:50:38,336
Something's happening

1674
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:39,872
Launch new products

1675
01:50:40,128 --> 01:50:40,896
Absolutely

1676
01:50:41,408 --> 01:50:44,480
What you're seeing happening

1677
01:50:44,736 --> 01:50:46,784
Website traffic

1678
01:50:50,368 --> 01:50:53,184
Corresponding with the publication and distribution that are

1679
01:50:56,256 --> 01:51:02,144
I could not tell you that 100% but there is definitely a spike in traffic and definitely a spy concealed

1680
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:09,312
I cannot tell you that they are correlated at all or happened at you know there's no relationship between them to add

1681
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:16,480
They are there I could not do that I would have been chilly just start narrating my feelings at it while he's asking the question be like

1682
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:18,784
This I know this I know where this is going donut

1683
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:22,112
Oh God I mean what do you want me to answer what is the weather

1684
01:51:22,368 --> 01:51:23,904
Yes okay yes

1685
01:51:24,416 --> 01:51:30,560
Maybe it's worthless worthless traffic

1686
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:36,448
Why did you do that part I was going to do the thing and then you were going to leave it there

1687
01:51:37,216 --> 01:51:37,984
Yeah

1688
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:42,080
So I think we can see here that there's

1689
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:46,432
A real difficult argument that tempers is trying to make

1690
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:49,248
About being unaware of this

1691
01:51:49,504 --> 01:51:52,576
It seems like he probably was fairly where this and is playing dumb

1692
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:53,856
And good for him

1693
01:51:54,112 --> 01:51:57,184
Pulling teeth with these people

1694
01:51:57,440 --> 01:52:02,048
So there's a lot of this deposition that I have not included because it's a discussion of like

1695
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:08,448
The software that was used to run for shopping in for store

1696
01:52:08,704 --> 01:52:14,848
Some discussion of why Alex wanted redundancy and having two stores make sense you know

1697
01:52:15,104 --> 01:52:21,248
If one goes down you've got the other

1698
01:52:21,504 --> 01:52:27,648
There's quite a bit of conversation about that that is interesting I guess but not real

1699
01:52:27,904 --> 01:52:28,928
Really that important

1700
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:31,232
So but not really

1701
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:34,816
31 last clip year and it's a little bit off the beaten path

1702
01:52:35,072 --> 01:52:36,608
And it has to do with

1703
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:42,752
The fact that Tim was a bit of a point person in terms of getting people to produce

1704
01:52:43,008 --> 01:52:43,776
Things for

1705
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:44,544
Discover

1706
01:52:45,056 --> 01:52:46,848
And tell me that

1707
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:47,872
My God no

1708
01:53:08,352 --> 01:53:10,144
Okay yes do you mind

1709
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:13,472
Resuming a little bit

1710
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:17,056
That's much better

1711
01:53:17,568 --> 01:53:20,128
Prince I Would note that the second page actually appears

1712
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:36,000
March 29th

1713
01:53:37,792 --> 01:53:38,560
Ear piercing

1714
01:53:44,192 --> 01:53:49,824
Clarify this affidavit to deposition

1715
01:53:53,152 --> 01:53:54,944
Let me look real quick

1716
01:53:58,528 --> 01:53:59,808
Yes this better crew

1717
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:06,464
Your role in producing response

1718
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:11,072
Cancel

1719

Text messages

1721
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:26,432
Yes

1722
01:54:35,136 --> 01:54:36,672
That sounds right yes

1723
01:54:37,696 --> 01:54:38,208
And

1724
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:43,072
You instructing employees who

1725
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:57,920
It sounds right

1726
01:54:58,176 --> 01:54:59,712
No point in time did you think

1727
01:54:59,968 --> 01:55:06,112
Maybe that's not a good thing to follow up with some of these people

1728
01:55:06,368 --> 01:55:08,160
Reminder email at 8

1729
01:55:08,416 --> 01:55:12,000
In case you were wondering apologies for saying guys I meant to say people

1730
01:55:12,256 --> 01:55:13,280
People

1731
01:55:13,536 --> 01:55:17,888
Just send us

1732
01:55:21,472 --> 01:55:22,496
This glimpse

1733
01:55:22,752 --> 01:55:28,896
Was very different than a lot of the other depositions that we've had it opened the door into another song

1734
01:55:29,152 --> 01:55:35,296
Side of things the business guy in his face is never around anywhere

1735
01:55:36,576 --> 01:55:37,344
And I think

1736
01:55:38,112 --> 01:55:38,880
I think you suck

1737
01:55:39,392 --> 01:55:41,696
I mean

1738
01:55:41,952 --> 01:55:43,744
I think there is a

1739
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:50,912
More touchdown this quite a bit. Like that more so than any other person didn't divorce

1740
01:55:51,168 --> 01:55:51,936
Seeing deposed

1741
01:55:52,192 --> 01:55:56,032
A complete abdication of any responsibility for what they're doing

1742
01:55:56,288 --> 01:55:58,848
Just someone who clearly doesn't like

1743
01:56:00,896 --> 01:56:01,664
Here's the thing

1744
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:07,552
There's a possibility that he clearly doesn't like Alex it doesn't like the show and all this

1745
01:56:07,808 --> 01:56:08,320
Or

1746
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:10,368
He understands that that's

1747
01:56:11,136 --> 01:56:12,160
What a normal person

1748
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:13,440
Would do

1749
01:56:13,952 --> 01:56:15,744
Turn on the front

1750
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,560
Of not liking Alex's show because obviously

1751
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:23,680
No one in their right mind would think that this is a great show either is pretty

1752
01:56:24,448 --> 01:56:25,984
Man I mean I think

1753
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:28,032
To me it's a bit like

1754
01:56:28,544 --> 01:56:29,312
If you know

1755
01:56:29,824 --> 01:56:31,360
If you're the Executioner

1756
01:56:31,616 --> 01:56:37,760
Doing the is that lethal injection or whatever and you're actively against the death penalty that you're out

1757
01:56:38,016 --> 01:56:38,784
Out of your f****** mind

1758
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:39,552
You know like

1759
01:56:39,808 --> 01:56:40,320
You can't

1760
01:56:40,576 --> 01:56:41,600
You should get a new job

1761
01:56:41,856 --> 01:56:48,000
Do the thing you know you can't do it yeah I think you have a moral responsibility to leave a job that you

1762
01:56:48,256 --> 01:56:50,304
Ethically opposed absolutely

1763
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:52,864
Yeah and forever for him to just decide

1764
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:55,424
Callously and cynically just like

1765
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:56,192
You know what

1766
01:56:56,448 --> 01:56:56,960
F*** it

1767
01:56:57,472 --> 01:56:58,496
Sure

1768
01:56:58,752 --> 01:57:03,360
00 injecting I don't give a s*** I think a lot of people

1769
01:57:04,128 --> 01:57:08,736
In in some corporate environment probably do have some misgivings about

1770
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:10,784
The companies that they work for it

1771
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:13,600
To the extent

1772
01:57:15,136 --> 01:57:21,280
You know you're working for a right-wing propagandist to agitate against people and communities and

1773
01:57:22,048 --> 01:57:26,400
You have to be aware of like that's I don't believe for a second that he doesn't

1774
01:57:26,656 --> 01:57:32,800
Doesn't have a general sense of the stuff that Alex that's bad because I mean quite honestly as you're saying like the

1775
01:57:33,056 --> 01:57:39,200
You're aware of know you're aware of yes because he doesn't agree with the stuff that's on Alex Jordan he's aware of it

1776
01:57:39,456 --> 01:57:45,600
You know like something to disagree with that you're aware of what it is that you are a part of

1777
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:47,136
Exactly even if you

1778
01:57:47,392 --> 01:57:50,720
What are the details if you want a game points

1779
01:57:50,976 --> 01:57:55,328
For being against it or like

1780
01:57:55,584 --> 01:57:58,400
You're still aware of what it is you still

1781
01:57:58,912 --> 01:57:59,680
Cash the check

1782
01:58:01,728 --> 01:58:03,008
Yeah 100%

1783
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:05,824
It's like oh yeah you know I was

1784
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:11,200
Sure I was I was the campaign manager for Lindbergh but I'm not an anti-semite

1785
01:58:11,456 --> 01:58:14,272
Okay I don't think that I think that's a way bad idea

1786
01:58:14,528 --> 01:58:18,112
I was trying to make him president but I thought it was a bad idea to do it you know

1787
01:58:18,624 --> 01:58:24,000
I have some more depositions and stuff to that will get two down the road but

1788
01:58:25,024 --> 01:58:28,864
You know it's it's weird there's a there's a batch that I have that

1789
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:31,936
They're more conflicting then

1790
01:58:32,192 --> 01:58:33,728
Some of those are the ones that we

1791
01:58:33,984 --> 01:58:36,032
Covered in the past like Alex's

1792
01:58:36,544 --> 01:58:39,616
Obviously there's a bunch of bulshit and he's being a dick and

1793
01:58:40,128 --> 01:58:41,920
You know what have you Daria

1794
01:58:42,176 --> 01:58:48,320
I mean granted Arias was crazy and conflicting and then scary

1795
01:58:48,576 --> 01:58:54,720
So like that I knew once we have the audio video of it I got a while

1796
01:58:54,976 --> 01:58:59,840
This Tim Forge one is a bit conflicting to me and some of these other ones are too so

1797
01:59:00,352 --> 01:59:03,680
You know granting a new chapter I guess of deposition

1798
01:59:03,936 --> 01:59:05,472
Congrats are good this is weird

1799
01:59:06,496 --> 01:59:07,520
I think what's fascinating

1800
01:59:07,776 --> 01:59:08,544
All too often

1801
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:09,312
Is that

1802
01:59:09,568 --> 01:59:10,080
Look like

1803
01:59:10,592 --> 01:59:12,128
Anon-v shows

1804
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:14,944
Tuesday on these shows

1805
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:15,968
You know it

1806
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:18,016
You can you can create this

1807
01:59:18,272 --> 01:59:22,112
Fictional version of somebody and then whenever you see them in those

1808
01:59:22,624 --> 01:59:25,952
Moments where they're not on camera where there have to be people

1809
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:27,232
Humanizes.

1810
01:59:27,488 --> 01:59:33,632
And in this regard I think every deposition we've it's done the complete opposite is dehumanizing

1811
01:59:33,888 --> 01:59:35,680
I know what they think the more I'm like

1812
01:59:35,936 --> 01:59:39,776
You're an alien from somewhere else cuz this is bananas

1813
01:59:40,032 --> 01:59:42,848
Yeah and then what strange 2 is that

1814
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:46,944
This is the first time that you have in it

1815
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:52,064
He was some guy was there in the business section of stuff

1816
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:57,184
It wasn't a a Persona or anything this is just you're getting a

1817
01:59:57,440 --> 01:59:58,208
Clear

1818
01:59:58,464 --> 02:00:00,000
First view of him

1819
02:00:00,256 --> 02:00:06,400
And that is something that's a little bit different Salazar granted never seen him on camera

1820
02:00:06,656 --> 02:00:12,544
Read his word seen seen him on Twitter

1821
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:14,592
I never seen a creative output

1822
02:00:14,848 --> 02:00:15,872
From temperature

1823
02:00:16,128 --> 02:00:22,272
You know I wonder if that is exactly though what you would need to be to be the money person at Infowars you know you

1824
02:00:22,528 --> 02:00:25,600
Can't be a believer because the believer is not somebody you want handling money

1825
02:00:25,856 --> 02:00:32,000
That's why you have an accountant also I mean to do that

1826
02:00:32,256 --> 02:00:35,328
Would require the sort of moral of absence

1827
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:37,888
That is it's not that he's exhibited

1828
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:42,240
Xzibit exhibit

1829
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:45,568
I don't know

1830
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:47,104
Maybe God damn

1831
02:00:47,616 --> 02:00:53,760
But it still sucks I terrifying again I want to run away from these people and I'll allow it now cuz we're done

1832
02:00:54,016 --> 02:01:00,160
What does Jordan another episode hopefully with the prediction for 2023 so we can go about living Our Lives

1833
02:01:00,416 --> 02:01:05,536
2526 we're going to finally know what 2023 women's pattern here mayonnaise

1834
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:09,376
Hey you owe us yeah

1835
02:01:10,912 --> 02:01:12,960
But will be back until then

1836
02:01:13,216 --> 02:01:14,240
It's not right.

1837
02:01:14,496 --> 02:01:20,640
Ross on Twitter

1838
02:01:20,896 --> 02:01:22,432
Text Clark I'm

1839
02:01:22,688 --> 02:01:23,712

This word elope Oliver

1842
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:33,696
That guy sucks

1843
02:01:34,208 --> 02:01:38,560
From the introduction to his book The I don't even want to say the name

1844
02:01:38,816 --> 02:01:39,584
But

1845
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:41,888
The introduction to his book he explains

1846
02:01:42,144 --> 02:01:43,680
That the first born

1847
02:01:43,936 --> 02:01:50,080
For six generations of his family has been given the palindrome

1848
02:01:50,336 --> 02:01:52,896
Legacy thing

1849
02:01:53,152 --> 02:01:54,944
And now here comes the sex robot

1850
02:01:59,296 --> 02:02:02,880
