      "text": "The controversy goes back to May 2009. An incident between two groups of students at Live Oak high school at a school sponsored Cinco Demayo event, a Mexican American student walked around campus with a flag of Mexico and other students flew a makeshift American States flag or United States flag in response and chanted at the flag bearing students. Students on both sides complained about the incident. A year later, several students came to school on Cinco Demayo wearing American flag shirts and school officials told the students to remove the American flag shirts, or turn the shirts inside out. The educator said the American flag shirts could send a message that would offend the Cinco Demayo celebrants and they had public safety concerns. So what ended up happening was there was essentially standoffs between Cinco Demayo, celebrants and kids aggressively wearing American flag apparel at them on Cinco Demayo."

And he had to stand up on this big makeshift blockade they put on the road and they couldn't kill him. They were shooting people all around him and he stood there in a big black fur coat. Just staring at him with his eyes and the night it was like a specter completely broke there will nobody talks about Jackson, no blue remain about him. But notice, in the White House, there is a bust of Jackson on a horse and then there's a big painting right behind Trump of Andrew Jackson. He's the guy that killed the early Federal Reserve they had then He's the guy that survived more than the Native Americans.
