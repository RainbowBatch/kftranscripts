It was a great moral moment for our military and our intelligence agencies, they finally hit bottom and decided to not follow criminal orders that they've been following for decades follow. A real come to Jesus moment. And so Trump knows about all this brought and Flynn, they've released the communique is that Flynn's supposedly made which we're not secret? He's the national security adviser in waiting of the elected president. At that time, December 15. Who was the president elect, setting up down the Presidential leaders working around the clock for the new agenda against the little they've released the CIA State Department, you know, transcripts of what was said the Russian ambassador who he's supposed to talk to, that's what the President's National Security Adviser does not the sanctions with you but you know, the President wants to open things up and wants to have a clean slate. So that's he repeated what Trump had said at press conferences and tweets, he said the President's policy, the president can meet with the Russians. The President can sign treaties.

And the intelligence agencies can't help but run across all the weird occultic stuff that the elites are into. It runs the gamut, but it's just an entire sewer of different garbage floating through it. Who are the things they're meant to but it's all about hurting in a sense. degradative people are dominating and slaving that's why they've got you know, 50 Shades of Grey that a new one comes out and it's more intense and now people are getting killed being part of it. Oh, God to death and then the hospitals are having all these emergency calls. And then next, it'll be Oh, killing somebody. And the next raping a child. See, that's how they successive approximation. People say well, it is kind of fun to slap your wife on the butt. You know, they like it. Well, that's not hurting somebody that's, that's fine. They like it. You like it? That's actually hurting somebody."

The only thing I can base that on is this next line. Okay. What the, what the Kremlin fears most today is that Trump may be ousted or even killed. That's the only line that has anything to do with it. And I don't think that they're saying they're worried that that's going to happen. It's just that that would be a bad outcome. It would be a bad outcome, and they shouldn't be worried his ouster Kremlin insiders argue is bound to unleash a virulent and bipartisan anti Russian campaign in Washington agreed oddly, therefore, Putin has become a hostage to Trump's survival and success. This seriously restricted Russia's geopolitical options. The Kremlin is perfectly aware that Democrats want to use Russia to discredit and possibly impeach Trump, while Republican elites want to use Russia to deflate and discipline Trump. The Russian government fears not only Trump's downfall, of course, but also the possibility that he could opportunistically switch to a tough anti Moscow line in order to make peace with a hawkish Republican leaders in Congress."

This, this actually is pretty interesting and ends pretty interestingly, anyone who spends any time in Moscow will quickly discover that ordinary Russians, in contrast with a majority of Europeans feel surprisingly positive about Trump. One reason is that they're exhausted at Russia's confrontation with the West. Another is that they share Trump's cynical, borderline apocalyptic view of international politics. Like Trump, they never believed in Win Win politics in the first place. Most interestingly, of all, they readily compared Trump to an early Boris Yeltsin, impulsive, charismatic, trusting only of his family and ready to bomb the parliament if that works to cement his hold on power. The problem for the Kremlin is that Yeltsin was a revolutionary leader, and Putin has decided to make 2017 a year for deploring not celebrating revolutions, which goes back to the beginning of the article when he's talking about the Bolshevik Revolution, which is just good writing to tie the end back to the beginning of good writing when you're when you're talking foreign policy stuff, and it's kind of you're in the weeds a little bit like that article is the ability to bring the end back to the beginning. First of all, I tip my hat. That's good, right. Yeah. And then second. I mean, like, what do you know, when he says that, like it's deploring?
