      "text": "Hey everybody, Dan here, sitting in to give you a little bit of an introduction before we get into this episode, tell you what's going on here. What's going on is Jordan is busy this week real busy. He is way too successful at stand up comedy. And I have therapy one night this week, so we could not find a time to record. Luckily for you and for all of us. I have this episode that I'm going to release today that I recorded a week or two back with my friend, the very funny comedian Justin Kollek. And I'm excited to be able to release it for you. To give you a little bit of context, we recorded this episode A little while back, and I did not have the time to edit and re release the episode. And in the meantime, like right after Justin and I recorded this episode, when I was about to release it, we needed to me and Jordan needed to get back into the studio. There were emergency episodes that had to be done. And you know how it is. There's a forward momentum and a natural narrative that sort of taking shape with Alex Jones his life and you know, we can you as progress marches forward, we sometimes things get caught by the wayside. But I'm glad we have this opportunity now to double back a little bit and listen to this, because I think this episode is great. And I think you're gonna really enjoy it. And Justin is hilarious and fan tastic. But before we get to this episode, I have a couple things I wanted to get off my chest first, is a very exciting announcement that I'm not going to make now. What once Jordan does get back, we have a very exciting announcement to give you. And I look forward to telling you about that. And I don't know why I'm teasing it now. But who cares? Second thing, I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge that I may have been a little bit off in my interpretation of the last clip from the February 24 show, when I've listened back to it a number of times, mostly out of insecurity and fear that I had misinterpreted it. I think I might have. I think it's entirely possible that my analysis was off, literally off, but spiritually, I was not wrong. What do you says is still horrible. What he says is absolutely indefensible. You should never ever encourage people on Twitter to harass anybody, but especially about someone else's children. So no matter what the context of that is absolutely unacceptable. inexcusable behavior. But I am big enough man to recognize and publicly admit that I might have gotten some of the particulars about what he was saying slightly off, but to my credit, he does swallow some syllables in there. So I I'm, I'm on pretty solid ground, I think. Anyway. I don't feel better now that I've got that off my chest. But no, well, who cares? I am gonna feel better here in a moment because I've got this episode to share with you. I hope you do enjoy it again. Just thank you to everybody who's been getting on board. We really appreciate everybody listening, tweeting out. I'm sitting here on a dark and stormy night here in Chicago, and I've been waiting to do laundry all night and someone's been hogging the laundry machine. Only thing that makes me feel better about the fact that I have to go to work tomorrow and dirty clothes is the fact that I know that you guys are gonna be out there enjoying this episode. And that means a lot. So anyway, here we go. Let's get to the episode. But you know until Jordan gets back and we we we meet again. I'm just flipping policy Walkman."

So she believes she was already in heaven. And I think about Colonel Craig Roberts, who was a Marine Corps sniper and veteran helicopter pilot investigator best selling author, Sniper one shot one kill, who expose Oklahoma City as an inside job and so much more in the murder of police officers by the Clinton mafia to cover it up. And he died for about 10 minutes on the operating table for colon cancer, and was there at the portal with the angel, the decision was made to send him back, they'd already walked off and he came back to life. And atheists and people that don't believe in God. And people that are in other cultures, they have that same, that same near death or death experience. So just know this. There's a lot going on in this world. But I just want my grandmother to know that I love her. And I appreciate her and I can still feel her presence now just like I can feel my first grandparents that went Jerry Jones, my dad's dead back when I was only six years old. And it's just good, I will carry them forward with me. I hope my children will carry forth my energy and my spirit with them, just as they carry my genetics. And so let's just all think about our fallen grandparents, and of course, our parents and everyone we love.

Trump is everything from Alex Jones. No, Trump has agreed with me on a few things that are overwhelmingly documented. Trump is his own person. I don't say that. Because I don't want to sit here and make the president mad. I say that because it's true. But clearly, they're trying to hurt Trump by driving him away from his base. It's not working, he's delivering in spades. But every day I see scores of these articles. Infowars is behind President Trump's idea that the media is covering up terrorist attacks, the Washington Post. Then they show headlines where myself Paul Watson and countless others live, but they only show screenshots. You can't go see it for yourself. It's a screenshot where we go show where police chief's the FBI, you name it are told to cover up the fact that Islamist is carrying out attacks just like San Bernardino. Now, the truth is Trump has trolled the media when he spoke at Central Command in Florida yesterday, at their headquarters, because he knows they'll bring all this out now and lose this debate."

The other is that that list of unreported terrorist attacks, that was some shameful ship. You get a chance to go over that list. Oh, they misspelled San Bernardino.

I do not remember they were dumping chemicals into this river. And it was turning the shrimp gay and returning the actual shrimp in the shrimp in this river Labor Day? No. Well, here's the thing is it's based off real science that pesticides run off into the streams they have, what do you want to call it? estrogenic qualities and, and so much so that the small species only like a shrimp, it can actually flip their species female. So now all the shrimp are female so they can't reproduce so they die off. Okay, so now there's a genuine story that I remember hearing about in like biology classes in college about pesticides getting under like unreported their damages, and it's causing these problems and it could be causing to a tick in breast cancer in the human population. So he brings in a real kind of issue that is alarming and in undercover and under covered but he turns it into its turning the shrimp gay Of course, and they're doing this because they want to they're experimenting to turn us gay. Yes. So then we don't reproduce. And it's a form of eugenics that the globalists are going to use to keep population down and kind of trim population to like whatever their number one there's always that number, right?

They've already invaded 16 of them. That was back at the time four years ago. And we've got to stop them. They're now in 30 plus countries on that list, sir.

It's a major threat. We've got to stop it. They've been telling Trump that the Trumps had General Flynn and people telling him behind the scenes for three years. A year before he ever announced running for president. Four and a half years ago, General Dempsey, the head of the Joint Chiefs, went to the White House and told Obama we're not gonna be the Air Force for al Qaeda member all that in the news at the time.

And I don't think it's right to someone who's in college, you shouldn't treat them necessarily like they're a full grown adult, because they're still figuring a lot of stuff out and developing that sort of thing. But they're not so impressionable that having a challenging teacher is dangerous. So if you have a teacher, even if they are a little bit wacky, like even this guy, yeah, I could take a class of his when I was in college, and be like, I gotta get through this thing. It wouldn't make any damage me"

You can feel it when he's on and when he's not. And it just felt like he wasn't really on. It was Graham and just admin. It could be part of it.
