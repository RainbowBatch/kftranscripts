Right now, remember, I told you that during the election, and it was true, Alex because there are internal polls you can get. But when you go to major pollsters, now they're so controlled, they will not give you a public poll, it's under contract that you can set the parameters of that are actually fair, and the demographics you want polled that are fair. They have their methodology. So the fix was in. And that's now come out. I told you the fix was him with poles. So the fix is him.

And then I saw that earlier in the week, and then I started seeing articles going well, where it is they leaked about that mission. And the list, because it was so effective. And you know, Obama doesn't want al Qaeda and ISIS to get rolled up because Hillary and Saudi Arabia and all them were behind them. And then I made some phone calls. One of the calls hadn't come back yet. That I called others. They said, Yes, that's what's being looked at. They were ready for them when they got there. And we know, Obama wouldn't Greenlight these lists, that the Navy Seals and special operations in the In the Green Berets and the Delta Force wanted to go after. So that's what happened. And the CIA came to Trump and said, there, here's a list of a whole bunch of targets we've had for six months. Obama won't hit him because it's his real command basis. And Trump said, well, let's have meetings about it. They said, Okay, they said he had them, then that's what you're saying. And then that now, moles in those very Gribbs have now leaked the end of the list, so that when our forces show up to take out the worst terrorists in the world, they're waiting for them."

Don't even pay attention to who got the coin toss right there. I'm glad we don't even know it's the possums versus the dirtbags seriously that we're not just saying we got censored it was in the news that CNN MSNBC were banned by David Brock at Media Matters the main Soros operative. Two weeks before Trump got into office is president elect Obama passes a law signs at the CIA over media to quote ban fake news, Drudge Report and Infowars and Breitbart. Now, Trump is so busy trying to turn the economy on he doesn't even know that they've got advising Congress right now Brock on short websites to ban and shut down when he wants his chief presidential advisors site shut down. Even if it was fake news, which it's not. You have a right to shut it down. We're not North Korea. And now this book, which we're selling, everybody should get it we need funds to fund ourselves. It can be a piece of toilet paper, you should buy it for 9095 Hell for 30 bucks is a big old thick, juicy color photos making of a president 2016 How old shows got Trump's here it's all in here. And they're trying to censor it because it went to number one on Amazon political and it usually goes to number one after that. They don't want this to be made into a movie they want to block. Ignore the fact who's gonna play Alex and again, we the Joe Rogan podcast hit no one should buy track number one on the front page of YouTube I'm in the trending section everybody goes to, they just blocked it. And then for a day, they blocked it on iTunes. I talked to Joe yesterday. He says it's already the biggest thing they ever had. He sees the internal numbers. They're even blocking that from the public. So again, everything we do is number one, number one, number one, everything we do is number one, a lot of America watch is what's the number one?
