So he's teasing that he's gonna play this audio of a guy talking to the Missouri Police. And I'm like, I don't, I can't imagine that'll be damning. Like I don't.

The initial version of the bill that was introduced in the House quote, called for a congressional commission to address and analyze several topics, including issues that deter volunteerism and how they can be overcome. How expanding international public service might affect diplomacy and foreign relations. And whether a workable, fair, and reasonable mandatory service requirement for all able young people could be developed, and how such a requirement could be implemented in a manner that would strengthen the social fabric of the nation. However, the version that passed the House had this language completely stripped from it. The version that passed the Senate never included such language at all. Even Orrin Hatch said, on the, on the Senate floor, quote, consistent with our all volunteer army and volunteer opportunities and individuals choice and communities, nothing in this legislation is mandatory. Because Alex is saying that the bill passed and not that the bill was introduced, it's very clear that he's lying, or that the only thing he knows about the bill is based on the article on his site written by Paul Joseph Watson, who was way too sloppy to know that a bill can be rewritten in committee or any other place in debates. So the bill that's introduced is not always the same as the bill that's voted on. It's pretty clear this is just another example of Paul Joseph Watson having zero professionalism as a journalist and reporting some something completely inaccurate because it fits Infowars predetermined narrative."

So it does bear mentioning that a couple days before where we're covering now, Jack McLamb, noted Holocaust denier Jack McLamb, came on Alex Jones's show and read those 10 orders that the Oath Keepers will not follow. So there's already been sort of a priming of the audience to the idea that these Oath Keepers, these young kids on the scene, they're pretty cool. They're pretty cool. And I'm guessing that Jack McLamb, behind the scenes, connected Alex with Stewart Rhodes. seems like it. And bada bing, here we go. So Alex wants to ask Stewart, how'd this all start? How'd this get going?"

The people will join with the mild and ultimately find it unsatisfying, and head for the more extreme stuff. Once they start becoming acclimated to the extreme side, they'll find the answer as to why they weren't satisfied by the mild side: because it was controlled opposition all along. Because the thing is, the pipe doesn't go the other direction. In this example, Glenn Beck doesn't ever de-escalate things. No one gets free of Alex Jones's propaganda by becoming a Glenn Beck fan. No one deprograms from the Oath Keepers by falling in love with the peaceful anti-tech, sign holding demonstrators, and realizes that civic action is the best way to affect changes that they want to see in society. The slide goes downward, and every convert to the Tea Party is one more likely patriot movement recruit in waiting. I'm not proposing that this was an elaborate plan or intentional. That would be absurd, conspiratorial thinking, but I am suggesting that looking back on this, there could be no worse setup for the maintenance of a healthy body politic. Once the GOP started embracing the Tea Party, they were possibly knowingly or possibly unwittingly embracing not only the extreme side, they were also embracing the mild side that really only ever existed to be a conduit to the extreme side."
