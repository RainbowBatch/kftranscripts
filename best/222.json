And whether a workable fair and reasonable mandatory service requirements for all able young people could be developed, and how such a requirement could be implemented in a manner that would strengthen the social fabric of the nation. However, the version that passed the House had this language completely stripped from it. The version that passed the Senate never included such language at all. Even Orrin Hatch said on the on the Senate floor quote, consistent with our all volunteer army and volunteer opportunities and individuals choice and communities. Nothing in this legislation is mandatory. Because Alex is saying that the bill passed and not that the bill was introduced, it's very clear that he's lying, or that the only thing he knows about the bill is based on the article on his site written by Paul Joseph Watson, who was way too sloppy to know that a bill can be rewritten in committee or any other place in debates.

I'd like to take you back to 1818 when Georgia militia been slaughtered members of the peaceful Jihad tribe in retaliation for things that were done by other tribes. They knew in advance that the jihad tribe were a friendly group and not the ones who did what they're mad at, but decided to take out their anger on them. Anyway. If you go back in time, you'll find tons and tons of examples of exactly this racially motivated violence done by militia groups, but that's going too far back. So let's just mention the Bundy ranch the Malheur wildlife standoff the Oklahoma City bombing flag the unite the right rally in Charlottesville. And then there's the countless disrupted plots of militia members trying to bomb loss all false flags or take over army bases. And then there was fear the militia of noncommissioned servicemen who plan to poison an apple field and blow up a dam. As part of their plan to take over Fort Stewart in Georgia. Their plot was uncovered so in retribution, they killed a 19 year old named Michael Rourke and his 17 year old girlfriend Tiffany York and through their bodies in a lake because they thought Roark had snitched. And then of course, there's everything that the Oathkeepers have ever done. But that's a matter for another time. There's tons and tons of militia violence even in present day dating back to 1818. The history of militias have largely been pretending to be there to stand up in case and then they're laying there people getting bored and killing people and generally causing trouble."

Of course, he was attempting to tie Darren Huff's arrest and with the Montgomery information, leaving aside that the Dennis Montgomery information is complete bullshit.

Yeah, I believe that. This marks the beginning of Alex Jones getting involved with the Tea Party, though it isn't the Tea Party proper. It is the Oathkeepers. And they factor heavily into the story that remains to be told about the deterioration of politics that happens in 2009 and onwards. A very good strategy to definitely had nothing to do with a black president. Oh, no, ignore that coincidence? Yeah, a very good strategy to ensure that the Overton window has shifted in the direction you want it to, is to offer two options that both head in that direction, one mild and one extreme, the two sides probably don't even have to like each other. The mild side says the extreme is childish and not serious. The extreme side says they're the true movement and the mild side is controlled opposition to the alright and nothing in such a climate you guarantee that more people will sign up with the mild side, but the very nature of their overlapping rhetorics will tend toward a shift heading in the direction towards the extreme. The people will join with the mild and ultimately find it unsatisfying, and head for the more extreme stuff. Once they start becoming acclimated to the extreme side, they'll find the answer as to why they weren't satisfied by the mild side because it was controlled opposition all along. Because the thing is, the pipe doesn't go the other direction. In this example, Glenn Beck doesn't ever de escalate things. No one gets free of Alex Jones is propaganda by becoming a Glenn Beck fan. No one deprogrammed from the Oathkeepers by falling in love with the peaceful anti tech sign holding demonstrators and realizes that civic action is the best way to affect changes that they want to see in society. The slide goes downward, and every convert to the Tea Party is one more likely patriot movement recruit in waiting. I'm not proposing that this was an elaborate plan or intentional, that would be absurd, conspiratorial thinking, but I am suggesting that looking back on this, there could be no worst setup for the maintenance of a healthy body politic. Once the GOP started embracing the Tea Party, they were possibly knowingly or possibly unwittingly embracing not only the extreme side, they're also embracing the mild side that really only ever existed to be a conduit to the extreme side."
