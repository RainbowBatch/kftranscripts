A local television station had been tipped off to the arrest by the Maricopa county sheriff's office and broadcast footage of the arrest that evening. The Maricopa county sheriff's office held a news conference shortly after the arrest and our Pio appeared in interviews on a local television station saying quote if they think they're going to scare me away with bombs and everything else, it's not going to bother me. After spending four years in jail awaiting trial. Seville was about two years awaiting trial. Yep, he was about to sign a plea deal that would have sent him to prison for 20 years. Although he maintained his innocence. He was initially unwilling to take a chance on being sentenced to even longer than that. that he had been convicted if you were convicted. However, the former head of undercover investigations for the Maricopa county sheriff's office called Seville's legal team with a bombshell. Based on his review of the case, he felt that Seville had been entrapped. Although entrapment is all but impossible to prove in most jurisdictions. Seville's attorneys eventually discovered that the Maricopa county sheriff's office detectives had bought the bomb parts themselves what then convinced Seville to build it even though he was not predisposed to commit such a crime. On July 9 22,003, America County Superior Court jury acquitted Seville finding that the bomb plot was an elaborate publicity stunt to boost our piles reelection bid in 2000. Your fucking Syria 2000 Force did the Nixon in 2004 Seville argued our PIO and the Maricopa County or he sued our Pio in Maricopa County for wrongful arrest and entrapment, seeking $10 million in damages."

But be that as it may, but what I'm saying is a lot of these things, you end up filing information places and a lot of your private information is much more accessible than people think that I've seen tons of news reports about this. We're just mid level basic PII. Hacking individuals, let's say not even the most evolved, hackers are able to find tons and tons of private information about people and not illegally, they're just able to find it."

And under the direction of shower for a pile we brought Mr. Montgomery to judge Royce Lamberth, we used to be the head of the FISA Court, Judge Lamberth was the FISA judge that authorized had been lying Bin Laden wiretaps in his living room at three o'clock in the morning. And we got him there. The dilemma was, for all involved is where do we go with this? Mr. Montgomery, during his tenure as a contractor were the FBI and this is in court documents, had II legally executed a search warrant on his home with fabricated affidavits to a judge. And that was all bared out in a trial, I can find no evidence. He did not for obvious reasons, trust the FBI or want to work with the FBI. That posed a problem for us. Because the only other place we could have gotten to at that time would have been the Department of Justice. And I believe at that time, it was still Eric Holder. That was a problem."
