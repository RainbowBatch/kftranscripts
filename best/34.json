So he's talking about the, the Chobani plant is in Twin Falls, Idaho. Ah, and in that town, there was a story that came out in June of last year, about three kids who had attacked a young girl in a laundry room. That's awful. It is awful, but it was more awful was all the lies that got spread on right wing media. They know what they said that they raped this young girl at knifepoint, and that they had videotaped it and shown their dad and he congratulated them. It was all sorts of wild whitelisting as well.

Now, there's an article here in the Idaho statesman, which is the paper of record in Idaho, and they, they have an entire story about the plea bargains that these kids ended up having to take. Right. Which good I mean, if they should have maybe been punished harder, but the oldest was 14 at the time. So they're also minors. All right. The other thing that we have to take into consideration is that the full details of the case are under wraps. They're specific identities are under wraps, because they're all minors. Yeah, in this case, it's you can't publish the details about these people. But that's probably a good idea. The prosecutors and the defense attorneys have discussed the situation that actually happened and what happened was that there was a 1410 and seven year old boy, who basically one of them I believe the seven year old, groped a five year old girl in a laundry room."

In 2016, a total of 9287 new tuberculosis cases were reported in the United States, this provisional count rads fucking insane. This provisional count represents the lowest number of US TB cases on record and a 2.7% decrease from 2015. The 2016 tuberculosis incidence of 2.9 cases per 100,000 persons represents a slight decrease compared with 2015. It's a negative of 3.4% and a decrease. So that's nice. Yeah. So a cool, also the tuberculosis rates have been steadily declining all over the United States, if you like, if you include just US born people, there's a much sharper slope downward. If you include just immigrant populations, it's still trending downwards, but it's, it's still it's going down. It's a little slower, but it's still going down. Also, I pulled up the statistics as it relates to the specific cities, or sorry, states in the country, and their tuberculosis rates. And you really can't draw any parallels between states that have high immigrant populations. places like Texas and California, are all on the decline. There is a bit of an upswing in a percentage wise in Idaho. But there's a bout five times bigger upswing in West Virginia,"

He'll get to this later, but he claims that seven active tuberculosis cases were sent to Idaho and did a little digging into that and that is actually true. But here is a response from channel 11. in Twin Falls, Idaho. You might have seen an article published today by breitbart.com, stating that seven refugees with active tuberculosis were sent to Idaho. The article said that seven refugees with active TB were diagnosed after their resettlement in Idaho between 2011 and 2015. Seven people in four years. Interesting. The state epidemiologist confirmed that that is true. However, it's not the complete story. TB is nothing new for Idaho. According to Dr. Christy Hahn, the state's epidemiologist and the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare treats people both refugee and American every year. These particular cases are not contagious and do not pose a threat to the public. The department typically tests and treats refugees, the 90 days of them being in state, and the refugees are usually good patients. Quote from this Dr. Christine Han, we're very active. And the refugees are increasingly cooperative about wanting to be immunized, wanting to be put in any treatment they need and getting on their way to becoming good Idaho citizens. They really are very willing and eager to be treated. They do not want to pose a risk to anybody either. Wow, yeah."

How about you know, we got this awesome artisanal feta cheese going on? Why don't you bring some of that stateside, their cheese sucks. Why don't you try and sell it over there. So he convinced Humpty to do this. He started up his own little minor cheese operation. And he did it for two years. But at the end of it, he was only able to really break even with the business. And so he walked away from the feta cheese world, and, you know, sort of cut his losses sad day. Then in 2005 By chance homme de hula, Kaya noticed an ad for a craft yogurt plant that was shutting down. His lawyers and most of the people in his circle told him not to, but he decided to buy it and decided to start making some yogurt. Okay, he even went so far as to rehire some of the craft employees who were laid off after the thing went out of business where they A Syrian immigrant they were not okay. Well, I don't know. But the HA, but it's also and then you're caught? Yeah, I don't know. I think number one super relevant, did it. George Soros pay the I don't think Soros is in play at this point. Right. All right. But he had these people who were out of a job because of the craft factory going down, he swings in, buys the factory gives them their jobs back. Anybody, even Trump would admire that. That's been Oh, Trump"

But they're assassinating my character first with the general public before fake criminal charges or murder. And it says be dramatic. I'm smart. I've studied things. I have a feel for this. This is what they did before they kill you. They want me silence they want me under system so I can't speak out. While they quietly destroy me. All these little Lilliputians, it's not going to work. We're standing together. But this is the equivalent of the Alamo against the globalist or 300. I'm on the beach with our listeners, the frontline battling any other talk show host other news sites and everybody else out there to support us. They don't want you to see my response to Chobani. They're not going to put it anywhere watch, we will, it's up to you to get it out. It's up to drugs, the positive wants to. But whatever, I need your help. I stand with everybody else. I stand with everybody else when they're under attack, when they're being boycotted, I understand, we hang together, we hang separate. I need your hopes, I need your prayers, I need your financial support. And I need you to spread the links and the articles on critical news and information. I need you to understand how far we've already come. And we shouldn't be pessimistic because they're attacking us. That's because we're starting to win. We're over the target. So I want to see a record surge in funding. Because even though we've seen a record support, it is barely enough in the face of all this and I want to expand I don't want to just stay the same size. I want to grow in the face of the enemy, we have a job to do. These are products you need their game changing. It supports the broadcast sign up for auto ships to support us every month, it 10% off free shipping on $50 or more Infowars store.com or triple 82533139. And please pray for my crew and pray for our sponsors and our affiliates as well. And support those local sponsors don't sit there and think somebody else is going to do it or Oh thank god Alex is there and I'm not chastising you. But this is the main battle. This is the main enemy assault. It's every week new attacks and we're getting stronger in the face of it because you're pulling through for us but we got to keep pulling hard here are the globalist are going to absolute if people say oh he acts like a football coach.

Truck attacks in England, and in France, and in Sweden, and in Belgium. And it was all just funny because Europeans have no defense mechanism. They have no will just stand up and Ergun, the dictator just laughs He's got his companies here, everywhere taken over private schools. You name it companies just everywhere, because they know how to run stuff. And they know how to donate money and they know how to sue and they know how to bully. Well guess what, you just ran into a Texan. So you were never backing down. And our audience isn't backing down. They're Turkish ministers and 50,000 migrants a month to Europe to shock them. You're already doing it. Hell intimidation tactics have been working for over 1000 years for Islam. That took over much of the Middle East Europe, much of Africa, Asia. Islam took over all over the place. So the Christian Roman Empire we've taken over Syria, taken out Rage of radical Islam. And so it's been working hasn't been. It's been working to be arrogant. It's been working to be aggressive. It's been working to be in everybody's face. We just bend over and and grovel to the Islamification of Europe and London and every major city is truly truly sickening."

You want us to fight globalism, the sort of the New World Order Islam. You want us to stand up for freedom. He wants to promote sovereignty we're doing. And I'm very honored to be under attack by all these people. But I'm here to tell you, if you want to support the broadcasts, go to infowar store.com. And buy those products that great nutraceuticals great supplements. Great non GMO heirloom seeds, great water filtration, great patriot apparel to meet like minded people, great books and films 1000s of read 100% off on visits to knowledge whatever you do, spread the link spread the articles spread outward and say this is the site. This is what the globalist don't want you to see. Because we are so effective. They know we got Trump elected. They know you got Trump elected. They know nationalism, racism got Trump elected races, and global isms alliance with Islam will be their final fall. But you look at this guy that owns Chobani coming from nowhere hooked in with George Soros, the UN involved in this whole program, which the UN admits it's meant to end Western civilization. And you understand it's part of a large globalist operation which we are standing against. And that's why they're trying to shut us down. So if you're not supporting us, if you're not praying for us, if you're not spreading the word, about Infowars you're doing to your own detriment. We have products and they are hoping that you just see us as out there fighting for you and don't realize you're fighting with us. They're hoping you don't take action. Because if you spread the word and spread our articles and videos and get past the censors and the bots and if you buy our products, nothing can stop. We will defeat these people. This is my fight. This is your fight. This is our fight against a bye bunch of authoritarian globalist third world populations allied with the global elite who are totally cold blooded. This is world war three, its economic, its cultural, and we will win it. And in closing do this is a spiritual battle all of us as imperfect as we are need to hit our knees before the Son of God, Jesus Christ and ask that he give us guidance, and that he intercede with the Father, to give us the will, and the determination and the judgment, to lead guide and direct us with the discernment it takes to break the purely wicked and foul spirited system of globalism, Islam and modern liberalism that is all combined as a trifecta of evil against us. But our trifecta is much stronger. You won't find it in the globalist churches, you'll find it your heart and soul, and your communion with God, in that quiet place the most high that we have the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, and we are unstoppable. But this is the epic fight. And we are standing against the Islamist economic takeover and all their bully. And if you breathe air into our sails, and financially support us, and spread our links and articles and pray for us, we are unstoppable. Because you are unstoppable because our God, the God of liberty and justice and freedom and life. He is the true God and will cross the satanic god of Islam. Why Wow,"
