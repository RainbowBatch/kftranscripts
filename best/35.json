And they said, You're a wonderful dad, you put a few people in the coma, and then come back four or five times in court trying to work towards my wife being 50%, or my ex wife. And then the media won't even touch on that.

And so all I want is the truth to come out on all of this. Because I didn't file for divorce. I didn't trigger this, the courts, three separate judges, and an arbitrator took my children away from my ex life and gave them exclusively to me. I never asked for that. I want to be with them.

You can see here he's making an argument that his audience will like, yes, it will appeal to them because they're not engaging with, you know, the reality of what's going on. He's really good at that. He is a propagandist spin artist. And so when he's out on the street, talking to people who I don't really think are actual reporters, okay. It's really easy for him to win.

Now they're being removed like a tick off a dog's rear end being torn off this country, and they realize it as parasites, as little followers as as conformist. Posing as trendy.

Let's talk to this camera guy right here. Because when I was talking about human animal cameras, he was laughing Do you not believe human animal comedy or exist? Couldn't say one way or another could say one way or another? Smart thing like Nike ad for spider goats all of it. Oh, look, spider goats. Do you have any idea how dangerous all these human animal calm ears are? Do you have any ideas for viruses and the mutations that is creating that are cancers way up? Allergies are way up. This will affect your kids. Man. This isn't funny. I've had top scientists thought about this. I mean, 20 years ago, they had rhesus monkeys you could buy in Hong Kong, you know bazaars that glow in the dark that are part jellyfish. Think that's funny. They have horrible lives. It's incredibly painful for him. Kobe will probably play that because monkeys in his medical experiments is funny. It's funny that I'm upset about that. It's funny. It's something good to laugh at. It's fun to be ignorant and just be a trendy. It's fun to laugh at our show. It's fun."

And that, of course, is until that system collapses. And then we you know, we realize that we wish we wouldn't killed America, but the globalist want to kill competition. They want to consolidate control. Yep. And so again, I'm just here to tell everybody that Infowars is growing. And I want to thank all the listeners, for their prayers. But I just wanted to come over here and have a press conference with you guys, and clarify where everything is, where everything stands, and just realize that much of much of what has happened to keep saying, you know, the trial, lawyers would just say, he throws away the toys, and he does this, but I've never be a witness on the stand saying, I was ready to hear and he crucified Christ. And he sunk the Lusitania and the Titanic. And he shot Lincoln, you know, at the Ford theater. And, you know, Alex Jones Rob Fort Knox. Yeah, but who's poisoned George Washington. You know, Alex Jones did this all shows is that, but the great news is, mainstream media is so discredited. That the more that is the great listeners and so great news. Yes. So it's good to you. It's quite a paradox. But in little, you know, nested areas of followers, like here in Austin, Texas, you know, it's pretty clear that the government worship, let me tell you, the government loving corporate worship system, the fake liberal system still has, still has its tentacles, you know, growing and doing well. And so we hope to try to revive some of the people, just like North Koreans are gonna call our people in Venezuela. We're gonna call people in Cuba to call, you know, we're just here,"

The idea of like people having to make sense of randomness. Yeah. You come up with whatever explanation you come up with. Yeah. And, and the random chance of life? No, it's the Jews, obviously. Or the globalists, as it were. Yeah. And so once you have that mind, virus in your brain, getting rid of it creates a vacuum, it creates a gap where now the world doesn't make sense. And that's really scary for people. So I think a lot of the time you're used to having that crutch there, even though the crutch is actually hurting you. Yeah, digging into your shoulder, up here. Here we go. So there was this guy back in Columbia, Missouri, who used to come into the liquor store, my brother worked at all the time. He was this younger guy, maybe like 40 or so. And he always was in a wheelchair. And the story that we came to learn over the course of time, was that he was kind of like, as I recall, he was a scam artist, kind of trying to get disability stuff. Okay. And so he was on his side right now, he was going around in a wheelchair for a really long time when he didn't need to be in a wheelchair. All right. And so like and where this is going, Well, the thing is, because he stayed in a wheelchair for a really long time. A lot of his muscles atrophied. And he got to the point where he needed to be in the wheelchair. Ironic come up in exactly. And so he was so good. He was a drunk who put himself into a wheelchair by scamming a wheelchair. Yeah, fraud thing. So Alex Jones is listeners have that intellectual wheelchair. They don't need to be in the wheelchair. But they think it's easier to go through life with that wheelchair rolling around than it is to walk. Right? And they don't realize you do this too long. You won't be able to get out of it. You won't you just you'll never give up that wheelchair, metaphorically, and you'll stay in it such"
