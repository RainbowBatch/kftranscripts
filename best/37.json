So a report came out recently, a couple days ago about Facebook being caught sort of targeting people that they viewed as sort of weak and more impressionable, more vulnerable people. Okay. Alex is saying, and his argument that he's going to lay out is that they were doing this in order to make them liberals. They're recruiting liberals, basically, they're finding vulnerable people on Facebook. The truth is, at worst, it's an advertising strategy. It's much like putting sugary cereal commercials during cartoons, and stuff like that, or shady toy commercials during cartoons. Yeah, you're targeting youth, basically. So he's gonna make it seem really evil. But I hear here's what this actually was. The company Facebook said claims made about targeting site users were quote, misleading, but has since issued an apology and said that investigation would be launched into the matter. In the statement, Facebook said, quote, the analysis done by an Australian researcher was intended to help marketers understand how people express themselves on Facebook. It was never used to target ads, and was based on data that was anonymous and aggregated. I believe that but I also don't believe them, that it wasn't for marketing. You know what I mean? Right? It's all for marketing. It absolutely is. Why would they be helping marketers understand how people express themselves if it wasn't for marketing? Yeah, that's insane. So that part, I believe them? And I don't believe them. And I don't believe Alex. Now, he also said that they targeted 700,000 users. Now, this is unfortunate, because that's a specific stat that I can trace that has nothing to do with this. That has to do with Facebook, what they did in 2012. Do you remember that?"

Yeah, in 2012, they did this weird study without people's permission, where they would post based on key words, they could determine were positive or negative, they would take people and they would post primarily negative things on their wall and see what things they would post to see if it would affect their mood. Now, the research was done. And it technically isn't illegal. It's fucked up. It's technically not illegal. And it was done and published in like research journal. So it was legit.

They believe they're the cultural avant garde, and that they're the coolest people out there. Because they seek what is conformist they believe, to be in the in crowd. Well, the system then puts out a plastic artificial in crowd I've talked about this forever, that Wall Street and Madison Avenue that Hollywood has talked about for 67 years, Edward Bernays created Hollywood or helped Hollywood form to merge government officials with media to make the Hollywood stars and to make the political stars. And that's what things like the White House Correspondents Dinner, are really all about, is getting politicians with Hollywood and the media and making it like they're the upper class. They're the beautiful people and you're a nobody. And then once you feel like you're not part of the in class, they're up on a Mount Olympus, like the Greek gods, or demigods in their golden fields of Elysium and you just don't think you can attain it.

It's in The Washtech reports I've seen were 20 years ago, they said we're gonna have body augmentation and body changing, you know, the whole body modification movement. Not that it's bad if you've done that, but to get you ready for microchips and virtual reality. And this whole program, the CIA funded 25 years ago, the funding of the whole body modification movement, to get you to accept that just like they funded in the 60s Ugly art to that make you confused and think well, you don't know what's beautiful art and what's what's ugly. So it's mainly a scrambling of social mores so that they can move the Overton Window towards ugly architecture, austerity collapse. This is all declassified. There it is again, that's why they're attacking the family. That's why they're attacking classical beauty. That's why they're saying don't have murals of masculine men at colleges, you know, for the football team because someone might not be masculine. Don't say you have a mother and father on your elementary school entry form, say G or z because someone might have a mommy or daddy see, you can't have anything because it might hurt somebody else."

And his father says slaughter the best calf, we've got have a feast, my son's home. And his older son walks in and says, I never betrayed you. I never did anything to you. All I did was bust my ass to be true. And you've not been throwing parties for me like this. And the father says, this is your lesser brother. Of course, he's lesser and weaker than you. Imagine how much I love you. We don't need to throw a party to know how great you are. You're going to run this house, you're going to inherit everything. That God your brother's not dead.

I'm sure people were laughing and being like, the guy's an asshole. Yeah, but no one was like, Hey, we're gonna get him to take him down. Yeah, it's just weird demon fantasies. So in this next clip, he actually says something that is kind of surprising. And it's one of the first times I've heard him Say something vaguely negative about Donald Trump, who he does let slip that he thinks Trump is going sideways a little bit, as he puts it, which is real generous. Then he gets into what I would describe as how a racist describes racism, which is really interesting. I think, I think he's wrestling with some stuff. And he doesn't understand that he's on the wrong side of it. And he's projecting incredibly hard. So enjoy."

Once we get there, yeah, it's done. It's such an it's such a small number. And so there was like, this big long description that people someone had written up. And there was this, you know, part of it was like, Stephen Colbert, and shows like this in the mainstream media always tried to appeal to minorities, and minorities, and and, and gays and Muslims. And then like, in maybe two sentences later, it says something like, and people who watch these shows have the gall to call us racist. I realize I added an affected accent to that, which is actually that's me being a little bit. Yeah, that's okay. That's your bigotry shows my bad. I'll own that. Yeah, for sure.
