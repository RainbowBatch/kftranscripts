This email joke, it offers a glimpse into the way that the tragedy was being discussed internally by people like Buckley, who is someone who, like I said, is in a managerial role and is related directly to Alex Yeah, he's obviously joking about this thing with Quantcast being conspiracy against them. And the use of crisis actors at Sandy Hook as the outrageous example in the joke that tends to imply that he considers it an instance of something that is markable. Yeah.

Because what they've just laid out is that on the same day, a manager at Infowars, who's related to Alex was privately mocking Sandy Hook conspiracies, while simultaneously, Alex was promoting them on his show. This goes a really long way towards building the case that these people knew that what they were saying wasn't true. Earlier in the deposition, it was established that at least Paul was completely aware as early as the beginning of 2013, that the families of the victims are being harassed by people who believe these theories, which implies that the argument that they didn't know the consequences of their coverage, probably not true. And here you have a little glimpse of the behind the scenes vibe that really seems to suggest that the people at Infowars were aware that the information they were airing was worth mocking, which is to say not true. The pieces that come together out of this look really, really bad. Considering that this is not even close to all the information the plaintiffs are working with. It really seems like Alex is probably in some serious trouble. And this is all said and done. Oh, yeah. And Paul, I honestly think is probably play the playing this almost exactly like he should.

Mr. Jones, I'm going to caution you again. Please wait till I answer your question. Because as you can see, it's very frustrating for this man. And he's not here affiliated with any party. He's a private person who's paid to provide a service, just coming here to try to write all this down. So we have a good record. So let's try to behave in the deposition finished. Let me finish my questions. You didn't check any other Connecticut school district websites, did you because they all look like this. I don't. I don't remember. Well, let's say hypothetically, if you had gone and you had seen that every other Connecticut school district website looks just like this is pretty irresponsible to go on the internet. I mean, go on your website. I call this the smoking gun, wouldn't"

And it's meant to, you know, it's supposed to be like, Oh, they're pretending they're in different places. But you can tell they're in the same place because the media is all lies. Sure.

This is why people were suspicious about Yeah, there is a lie going around that let's say porta potties word delivered, blah, blah, blah, right? Instead, he's listing off all of these assertions of factual things and being like, that's why people had suspicions, right.
