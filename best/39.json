I was really struggling and then a real I realized on Monday, Alex Jones did an interview with Jack Passaic. Yes, we've brought him up a couple times in the past. And today, it is finally time for us to delve in to something that I am going to call one of our dirty dossiers. Because as we do this show, it's going to become more and more essential that we clearly delineate who these fucking characters are, okay, that exist in the periphery. Okay. Alex Jones had an interview with Jack for Sobiech because he is one of the main forces behind the Macron leaks. So I found a a New Yorker article that contradicts his story about what happened with the macaron leaks. Okay, this is a New Yorker story that actually uses an interview with Jack for Sobiech as it sort of foundation. Quote from this New Yorker article, I reached the Sobiech by phone on Saturday, the previous day he told me he had flown from Washington to Miami to attend a party hosted by the far right self promoter Milo Yiannopoulos. For sobic spent much of Friday night monitoring 4chan slash poll before chan message boards, which has recently become a breeding ground for nationalist trolls, both in the US and abroad. This is a quote from the Soviet people were claiming something big was coming. So I just kept hitting refresh. He told me shortly before 3pm 3pm and anonymous 4chan user posted nine gigabytes of information, purportedly hacked emails, photographs, and internal documents from the campaign of Emmanuel Macron. For Sobia could not know whether all the information was authentic. He didn't even have time to glance through most of the 1000s of pages. But he considered it his journalistic duty to let his followers know about the leak, quote, massive doc dump at pol he tweeted, he included a link to the 4chan post along with the hashtag Macron leaks. So that's how he got involved. According to him, I'd heard that that"

Obviously, some of these bot farms started to push the content, of course, much like it's been demonstrated has been done in the past. Yes. And so on the phone Sobiech started a live video on Periscope which he called a quote, press conference on macaron leaks. The first few minutes consisted of pisode B, which he has not read or looked at. He's gone to a party at this point. Yes.
