They start physically attacking you. But here we're tolerant. So I'm just saying we're letting in people in masks that are not tolerant, that are the most oppressive cult like people on earth and it freaks me out. You bet. I'm freaked out. You bet I am.

Instead, their excuse a bulldozer had accidentally backed into it, making it unsavable. It gets even more screwed up, though, when the city suggested it might hold Palmer accountable for his actions. He sued the city. In the end, he only had to pay $200,000 and provided some public mitigations Jesus, which basically, the public medications that we can find are that all of his amenities are private. So basically, he has outward facing homes. Yeah, so like, if you walk down the street, it's just the facade of a building.

      "text": "The most recent request came late Friday when Mr. Sharp asked every executive branch agency including the White House to give him by June 1, a copy of any waivers issued to political employees, allowing them to ignore any part of the executive branch's ethics policy, saying in his letter that he was, quote, advancing the mission of the Executive Branch Ethics Program. Such waivers are typically issued when the administration wants to allow a new political appointee or employee to work on an issue like federal housing or environmental policy that involves people the new employee may have worked with previously. For example, Ernest J. Morin's, the energy secretary in the Obama administration was allowed to work on matters that involve General Electric even though Mr. Manas as a nuclear physicist had served on a General Electric advisory board about 70 Such waivers were issued during the Obama administration. Mr. Trump, in his ethics order made several fundamental changes in this process, some of which Mr. Shaw is challenging. First, Mr. Trump eliminated a prohibition imposed by Barack Obama in 2009. On the hiring of staff members who had in the previous two years had lobbied the agency they now wanted to work for former lobbyist seeking jobs and Mr. Trump's administration administration must get a waiver from the ethics rules if they want to work on matters that overlap with their lobbying assignments in the previous two years. But ah, there's a but Mr. Trump has chosen to keep the waivers secret. He dropped a practice in place during the Obama administration that any waiver would be shared with the Office of governmental ethics and posted on the White House website or the Ethics Office website or on both the combined result eliminating the ban on hiring former lobbyist and keeping secret any waivers granted to new hires means the public has no way of knowing if Mr. Trump's staff are complying with the rules"

In the mid 1980s, North Korea reached a, quote, dangerous level of nuclear capacity with advancements due to increased Soviet support for their nuclear program right in 1990. Or I'm sorry, 1984. North Korea completed construction of a five megawatt I don't think that's correct, and MW gigawatt x m W E, five MWe gas cooled graphite moderated nuclear reactor for plutonium production. If operating at full power for a majority of the year, the reactor could produce 7.5 kilograms of weapons grade plutonium annually. There is still great disagreement as to just how much plutonium was produced. That was in 1984, those 33 years ago. So Alex is holding this narrative about the Clintons gave them their reactors, right. Everything was already there way in advance. China and North Korea both had Soviet help, obviously, it was an offshoot of the Korean War. It's it's what the fuck? This is such stupid shit.

Well, here's the thing that I'm going to quote. It is true that the refugee demographics do skew on the side of youth. Syria, in particular, as a country with a large population of young people between income, especially in comparison to Europe, the majority of Syrians are between 25 and 54 years old, and only 4.02% of Syria's population is older than 65. Compared to the European Union 18.5. If refugee and migrant populations follow their originating countries demographics, then we should expect to see that at least half of Syrian and other refugees will be male, and most of them will be young. To put the issue of age into perspective, as of 2015, Syria's median age was 23.8 racks was 19.7. And Afghanistan was 18.4. By comparison, the median age in the United States was 37.7. In the United Kingdom, it was 40.4. And Germany was 46.5. Children from Syria and elsewhere make up at least a third of the refugee population. Children who, whether accompanied or alone are looking for a chance to grow up in a country that is not shredded by violence. Now, if you want to really break it down, the reason that the population is so, so obvious, the life expectancy is terrible. Yeah. Health, Health care is provided as best it can be in third world countries, and also men and older people are killed, killed it just constantly. The reason that population is so young is because everyone dies really young. That's that it's not recognize that as a piece of the equation is so simplistic, it's it's racist, offensive, they're not racist, it's bigoted. It's not because it's not necessarily race specific. It's It's so fucking stupid."

Yeah, but the behavior, the frequency of outbursts, the inability to control himself is very much like he was as a child, like we talked about. And we've documented a number of times in our biography of him, right, all of these incredibly violent outbursts, these fights that he'd get into putting people in comas, and you don't see a ton of that necessarily in his adult life. Until getting way closer to that now, in terms of like, you don't see it on the show, but he just admitted the last time he talked about Oberman, he was throwing shit, right during the breaks. Now, I would also I would also those sort of outbreaks are probably happening more than just when he listens to fucking cold, cold bear or cold. Herman if you will? Well, I mean, the both of them, they can bear man. And if he's exhibiting those sorts of behaviors, and I'm being a bit speculative here, I don't think he is right to be around his kids.
