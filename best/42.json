Reason I'm butchering. The headline is Kitt just walked in with his great article that I asked him to do and then I just changed the headline he's going in there to change it right now. So I was changing it on air missing Malaysia Flight similar to last double oh seven McDonald flight. I think that's the way to put it. And it's a very, very important article and I'll be breaking that down after I take some of your phone calls. I want to show you something that's satanic though. If you're watching on television, I didn't ask for this. And Weldon Hanson is a great guy running the shipping department and the product department. But I guess Weldon was nice and some people do a decent hamburger chain for fast food. It's like organic decline. And I didn't ask for it. They got me a P Terry's hamburger. And this is satanic. Not not P Terry's in general. A little change started in Austin. This is satanic like a Ferrari that they're now coming up with a part hybrid. That satanic. A Ferrari that doesn't. And the wrappings racist because it's white. You know, they're trying to phase out brown bags and the word bossy because it might hurt feminists feminists like a Monty Python joke, but they're actually doing it. It's up on infowars.com this ladies and gentlemen is satanic. This is a P Terry's hamburger. And we're going to document cam shot at the offending item. Ladies and gentlemen, this this hamburger has no cheese. No ketchup, no mustard, no lettuce, no onions, no tomatoes. This ladies and gentlemen is is just satanic. Just like Trump take our guns is satanic. It's like trying to make men and women and women into androids is satanic. This is not right. This is anathema. Do you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna put Super Male Vitality on it. No one has ever done this before. Vulnerable at Infowars live.com. Put Super Male Vitality on it. And now I gotta get you started off and some survival shield nice and iodine. And now ladies and gentlemen, is no longer satanic. I have trends magnified at events a word to the most delicious burger in the galaxy. Stop being silly. Let's get into some serious topics. Steve and I forgot to eat today.
