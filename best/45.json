No. So now on to the issue of the Montana situation, which is that is if our Fox News reporter says that. What happened going to read the statement? Yeah, Fox News from Fox fucking News, Fox news.com. Faith Keith and I arrived early to set up for the interview in a room adjacent to another room where the volunteer barbecue was to take place. As at the time for the interview neared. Jian forte came into the room, we exchanged pleasantries and made small talk about restaurants in Bozeman. During that conversation, another man who we now know is Ben Jacobs of The Guardian, walked into the room with a voice recorder, put it up to GN Ford's face and began asking if he had a response to the newly released Congressional Budget Office report on the American Health Care Act. GE and Ford told him he would get to him later, Jacobs persisted with this question. GE and Ford told him to talk to his press guy, Shane Scanlon. At that point, GM Ford grabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him into the ground behind him. Faith Keith and I watched in disbelief as GE and Ford then began punching the reporter. As GE and Ford moved on top of Jacobs, he began yelling something to the effect of I'm sick and tired of this. Jacob scrambled to his knees and said something about his glasses being broken. He asked faith Keith and myself for our names in shock. We did not answer. Jacob said that he wanted the police called and went to leave G and four it looked at the three of us and repeatedly apologized. At that point, I told him and Scanlon who is now present, that we needed a moment the man then left to be clear. At no point did any of us who witnessed this assault, see Jacobs show any form of physical aggression towards Jian forte, who left the area after giving statements to the local sheriff's deputy. So that's what happened based on Fox News. Yeah, who witnessed the attack,"

That is that the spying on people accidentally took in some stuff that was covered under attorney client privilege. And so that's about right. Yeah. But I mean, of course, yeah.
