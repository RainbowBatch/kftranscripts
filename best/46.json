And it's very interesting, False Flag Campaign that no thinking that the shooting was a false flag. Oh, fuck. So I'm going to lay it out ahead of time, what you're going to experience is at the start of the episode, Alex can't say one way or the other. Because he knows how racially charged it would be for him to say this is fake. Yeah. So he's like, I don't know. I can't say there have been a lot of people who have been false flags in the past. We know that Operation Gladio exists. All this stuff. He's just doing that like putting his toe in the water. It's like yeah, maybe Intel. He has an interview at the end of the episode with a preacher. A Reverend Childress, okay comes on, and basically just says, Come on, this is fake.

I told him, Sir, you don't have to be doing this. He told me to shut the hell up. Then he asked me what my religion was. And I told him I was a Christian, a Baptist. He said, That sucks. And now that it was a stupid religion, needs replied, No, sir. It doesn't suck. It's a wonderful thing. God put me on this earth for a reason. I'm certain of that. ashbrooke fired several more rounds and yelled this religion is bullshit. And then he sat down and said, Fuck off and shot himself in the head. So, one good thing happened.

They appealed for amnesty from Bishop Desmond Tutu, Truth and Reconciliation Committee, which happened after apartheid, because they were like, We don't want to do Nuremberg trials. Yeah, we want to try and heal the wounds society, right. And so they appealed to the Truth and Reconciliation committee. And they ended up meeting with survivors and family members of victims from the massacre that they had carried out, and they reconciled with them. They understood the ramifications of their actions, they repented. And these sorts of things, I think that it's a better way to go about society as a whole. So they were all granted amnesty by the Truth and Reconciliation committee. Now, if that sounds fucked up, that four out of four of the people who carried out this massacre, were granted amnesty. Consider this only 849 Out of the 7112 applications for amnesty to the Truth and Reconciliation committee. were accepted. Okay, so it was not a rubber stamp thing. Okay.

White people can pull these right wing terror attacks, which are the most common form of terrorism in the United States.

It's him keeping up the room and a couple of the other clips that I'm going to play later, really bring into focus, how he thinks that Hillary Clinton is going to destroy the world. Now, in this April 5 2015 article a few months before, Here is a quote, this is just a direct quote from the article. But something strange has come over Larry, after six years of watching Barack Hussein Obama cower in the face of Islamist Nichols believes the family he spent two decades touring as cold blooded crooks might just be the only people who can save the country. Oh, for fuck say, quote, I'm not saying I like Hillary. You hear me? He said, defensively. I'm not saying I like Hillary Rodham Clinton. I'm not saying anything. I've said I take back, but God helped me. I'm going to have to stand up and tell conservative patriots. We have no choice, no choice, but to give Hillary her shot. Quote, I know she won't flinch. He continued. That's a mean SON OF A BITCH woman that can be laying over for people and say he paraphrased her now infamous response to hostile congressional questioning on the deaths of four Americans in Libya. What the hell difference does it make? He was against Clinton because of Whitewater. He's now voting for her because of Benghazi. Because she was so cold blooded about Benghazi.
