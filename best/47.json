Williams filed for a charter with the NRA and formed the Black Guard, an armed group committed to the protection of blacks. Mabel Williams said her husband altered the occupations of the members when applying for the NRA charter. And she's quoted, I'm sure when we joined, and the years after that had they have known that we were a black group, they would have revoked our charter. She said of course. force, they basically just lied about it and started an NRA chapter. Yeah, of course. So that why wouldn't you do that?

Downtown Nashville board, but I'm going to send the crew out to videotape tomorrow. You can scan that billboard you understand everything now I'm not an enemy of Chick fil A, they're a conservative Christian organization. I think overall, it's a good company that hasn't bowed to censorship. And I'm not criticizing Chick fil A itself, but I'm using their ad campaign as a window into guilt politics. Now chicken is about four times cheaper on average than beef. And they set up their little Texas based company in shopping malls 30 something years ago, and it spread nationwide is very successful. So we're not talking about Chick fil A. But on their billboard, I meant to get a photo that was too dangerous driving see those cows up there, painting sign. And they've drawn a little children's style image of a chicken. And they say eat this knot this with an arrow pointed at him. And the cows look real, but they also look humanoid. So they feminized them and the chicken form it all, it's been downgraded to nothing like you do a baby in the womb, you call it just a blob. So the chicken looks like a two year old drill it just a yellow dot, a yellow blob with two eyes. And it's perfect. And it plays on your guilt of not wanting to hurt an animal when you eat it. So it's saying go eat our chicken. It's not as advanced a life form as a cow. And I guarantee you go talk to whoever came up with that ad campaign. They'll say Yeah, that's exactly what the campaign is cheap, the average person would not look at that I was on a carload of adults. One day we drove by it, and then today with my children, and no one knew what the propaganda was. And I said, Come on, you're smart. You know what it is? And see, that's the difference between me and other people. Oh, I just know. So many different so it's all clear."

And they wanted to get some 3d aspects in it, right? They made a bunch of pretty interesting ideas, but they were all kind of like, it's good. It's not good enough. So they came up with one where it was three quarters of the billboard is done. And it's like a chicken sandwich. And it's like, you know, just a normal billboard. And then the last quarter of it is white, like the people designing it just had stopped, and it says boss got hungry, be back later on the last part of the Billboard, and then they have like a three D ladder going up to that. So people driving by it would get their attention. Yeah. So that was like, Okay, this is an interesting concept, but we can do better. And around this time with Simpsons were super huge. And Bart's catchphrase was Don't have a cow man, as they wanted to incorporate that somehow. These add these add wizards who are coming up with this? Yes, the Mad Men.

The north that was mainly industrial, had very high tariffs on the southern cotton, other things leaving the country, internal tariffs on them trying to sell their goods. Whenever we had a southern president, Andrew Jackson, the South tried to rebel against him and almost had a civil war over taxes. So so so even Jackson, northern agenda grew the South 2% of the South had slaves. Most of the whites that were poor, or as bad off as the black slaves. I mean, that's historical. They were called sharecroppers, they were slaves. For all intents and purposes, their ancestors got here to pay for the way over, they would sign up for seven to 10 years indentured servitude, I'm gonna skip this network breaks, we have more time to explain more, they would get over here. And so they were slaves to it doesn't take from the plight of the Africans who are definitely treated the worst on their way over here, and who were treated the worst when it came to their rights.

So the secession came before this Morelle tariff. Now, what's interesting is that the Confederacy wanted the British people to recognize the Confederacy as a sovereign nation. Yes. So what they did is they started to make the argument that because of the timing, the almost immediate passage of this mortal tariff, they what made the argument to the British that that's the reason that they succeeded, when that could not have possibly been the case. The secession led to the passage, right? So because of the closeness and time it created a ton of confusion, obviously, the British wouldn't want to support a group of people who had seceded from their country over slavery,"

So there's the pride of the South that they absolutely dominated the North when on average they were fighting for to one against Northern soldiers. But these were City guys from the North. They weren't the children of the you know, the wagon train folks. We talked about skin about run a trotline the North was fighting Davy Crockett. So that's why they were in deep trouble. The South ran out of shoes ran out of guns ran out of bullets. So there's this illustrious strength of the south and and and in the in the whole giant black brigades that fought on the side of the South. I wonder why in yards? The history you're given is not the real history that was going on slavery was a horrible institution at the West began the process of getting rid of ah, because they would try to arm their slaves basically."

He got shot in the back of the head. by John Wilkes Booth, we're told really, the evidence worked towards that being a setup that a lot of folks wanted to loot the South. A lot of Northern industrialist wanted to take it over the railroads. John Willis, was a false flag. Shots got shot. armed and trained a bunch of the South gave them weapons. And then when they had the boa constrictor or was the Anaconda strategy, it was the Big giant snake all the way around the East Coast all at the Mississippi to basically cut off supplies. The British didn't break those and didn't supply the South. I'm not demonizing the British either. These are just facts of what happened that you watch shows like routes or other shows.

But it's super normal. There's something that happens with every president. And I think one of the big reasons that Clinton didn't get it was because of the Larry Nichols types, and all the propaganda and the, quote, vast right wing conspiracy, that unfortunately is real, that Hillary complains about and is very much real. So speaking of rallies to cheer seems like speaking of Larry Nichols, he will be making an appearance on this episode here on the 23rd. This Tuesday show, but because Alex Jones is so bent out of shape about the TPP he plays a couple of really long videos, and one of them is Senator Jeff Sessions on the Senate floor.

He came on and I believe kicked off Off Alex's savior complex. Yeah, which was laying dormant and Alex for the entirety of his career. But the way Larry is respected by Alex, and the way that Larry said, Hey, Alex, what you need to do, you're the only one who can save us. The way he articulated it, I think, is the roots of Alex's journey. So he comes back on and this episode, he's mostly just talking about a lot of the murders that the Clintons have committed, talks about some guy who cut off his hands and his legs and decapitated himself and they ruled it a suicide, I found no evidence that this is a real thing that happened. But what he really wants to talk about is, we need to build an army. He's enlisting Alex's followers, to create an army to stop the Clintons."

So part of it is there's a running trend throughout it of there's this guy named Charles Dexter Ward, who at some point absolutely lost his mind. Right. And there are different psychiatrist that have like, thought it was at this point. Oh, no, it was later it was later.

He wasn't paid by the NRA. And by the way, $10 million, even though he was been a huge actor, back then you got paid maybe a half million dollars for starring in the movie to spend most of his money. That's why his wife talk trash about him and stuff. Once he was senile and rolled him out on TV where he I'm sorry, honey. Then week later, they announced he's totally don't even know who he is. Or he interviewed a chair, talk about traders rolling out wants you to know he is to have him to announce everything he stood for. I think it was NBC. Yeah. Yeah.

Everybody who is racist gets awards like Margaret Sanger and stuff like that. Okay. Whereas if you aren't racist, people call you racist because the globalists want to turn upside down world. Yes. So here is something from the NRAS website about Charlton Heston. There's a little bit of a biography. After the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy by a gunman Heston championed the Gun Control Act of 1968, a landmark federal law regulating firearms appearing on the ABCs The Joey Bishop show Heston said about the act, quote, this bill is no mystery. Let's be clear about it. Its purpose is simple and direct. It's not to deprive the sportsman of his hunting gun, the Marksman of his target gun, nor would it deny any responsible citizen, his citizen, his constitutional right to own a firearm, it is to prevent the murder of Americans. Heston oppose the Vietnam War and considered running for the US Senate as a Democrat. But by the 1980s, his political affiliation changed with his endorsement of a Republican Ronald Reagan for President. By 1997. He had joined the culture war, delivering a fiery speech at the free Congress foundation that argued that American society persecuted whites. A year later, he was elected the president of the NRA. Oh, oh, so it looks like maybe he lost his mind around 99."

It was an ad is all one big advertiser. Totally. Right. So if we're seeing this ad of Alex Jones now, then I can absolutely see that TED ANDERSON sent him a directive saying, we're on the Trump.

Each episode I have a breakdown of what happened on that day's show. And I am going to keep updating it as we go along. Also build in the current day.
