They tried to change the subject on to Trump being a sexual predator with no evidence. When Bill Clinton has settled rape cases and everything else. And his wife defended pedophiles and other rapists that she knew were guilty. She's admitted that she was they took their big witness, just like they were weak on Russia. So they blame that on Trump. They took their big weakness or their sexual predator activities and Jerry Epstein and Anthony Weiner and all the child porn garbage drop also went on. So they then projected that onto Trump. So what we did is we said listen, we've got to take action. So Roger Stone and many others work to get Bill Clinton's right victims into that debate. And I worked with you the listeners to go out and simply say Bill Clinton is a rapist."

She's gonna be destroyed by this, they've gone too far people are fed up, she did this right at the right moment where people were finally sick of the poison about the throw it up about to reject it. And the numbers show that that I can feel it. She came right at the right time, where they've now are throwing her overboard. And why are they doing it? That's another big question. Because they're preparing riots this summer. They want to pull back now and have the media act like they're not for the violence because they're getting ready to actually trigger it. They've got it built up and ready. Now they want to start crying it a month out from July, before they trigger it. We're almost exactly a month out from the July 3 riots. They're publicly planning nationwide. Like they're all for peace, so they can act like they repudiated those calling for violence ahead of it, and ahead of them launching false flags on patriots."
