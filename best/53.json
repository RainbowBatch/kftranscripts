Megan Kelly, NBC under fire over sickening Alex Jones interview. This is totally coordinated NBC bull. This is all PR especially out of Megyn Kelly, and Chelsea Clinton. So we know that you know hanging out with this is incredible. And Megan Kelly lied to me and said it wasn't a hit piece said that she wasn't going to get into these topics. And like Trump says better watch out there might be tapes. There's no question about there might be tapes. And I just knew I was walking into a trap. Because MSM doesn't get it no matter what they do, then why did you do ask me they're already discredited. They have the zombies that watch them. But that's it. Everybody else then just gets reminded to the show. So it grows even faster. Only those millions of people see you're in the WikiLeaks talking about Haitians dying because of your foundation, how your mommy and your daddy stole all the money, but you didn't do anything. And all the corruption and Jerry Epstein's pedophile airplane, all of it, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm just going to come back in the next segment.

And I was I was in Columbia, Missouri. Yes, I was in college at the at the University of Missouri at the time, and I was walking by the speaker circle, which is a place where you know, it's supposed to celebrate free speech. You'd have protesters out there a lot, but basically, it was just for this insane preacher named Brother Jed to scream at people already big fans, your whores that sort of stuff. Already. Big fan. Yeah. Real fun for a day. And then super annoying. Yeah, of course. But I was walking by and I heard him screaming about my dad. I was like, though, this is a twist. I didn't even know my dad had written this article about the passion of it. So I went into his room screaming about how like, you can't expect to find truth at an institution where religious studies is taught by Professor freezin. And I was like, Whoa, oh, right, my man. So I asked him like after he got done preaching civic notoriety, I like it after he got done preaching. And he was having a cooldown period. I walked up to him was like, hey, you know, like, I was curious. Like, you're screaming about my dad. I was just wondering, you know, is like, what are you talking about? Like you yelling about?

If you look at representative samples, there's a reason that this show specifically appeals to dudes. Further, it's 83%, white 3% African American. So that mean, the population is something to the effect of like 13% African American, you would expect something much closer to that if it wasn't a massive aberration.

Because otherwise the official statistics about refugees don't match up with their narrative. They say that all of them are military aged men, right? That's true at all. The plurality of them are women and children. Yeah. And so in order to get around that they're like, no, they're lying to you. There's, there's adults with children being classified as children. That's the game that they're playing right now further. I do not see a large difference between what we just listened to. And let's say I don't know, 70 years ago, someone being like, you know what? Look, not all black people are bad. But Oh, me. So who? Oh, I want to do Oh, want to get to women now."
