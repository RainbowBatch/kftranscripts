And America began to come back from the dead in the last few months, and now has come back to life. The Phoenix is coming up right now. And how powerful that Phoenix is how incredible that destiny is. He's up to us. We are what breathes life into the spirit into us. And the enemy knows everything's energy. You see, forget all the religious books and all the preachers are there to control the paradigm. They that the enemy wants to destroy our spirit make us feel weak, so we don't take our birthright and destiny. We're taking the destiny in our hands. We're breathing life into it. And those devil worshippers up there the enemy devil worshiper, Obama devil worshippers. Well, now these are devil worshippers, well, not a worshiper, they want people they want to be number one, they don't like see you they see the white paper. Okay, what somebody that wants prosperity and Renaissance, they want wealth, a cornucopia. They're not jealous of somebody who's got a big house or good looking wife, or vice versa, as long as you. For me, I think your success is great. These people are devil worshipers. And what happened today was the the chief executive invited God back in and said the doors open.

Most of all, what I got today was that I president says, we don't put God first try it. And the Bible says that your righteousness exalts a nation, and sin brings it down. That's it, he brought the tower back, here you go, we can't do anything without God. And when we put God first, nothing would be impossible for us.

Yeah. But what they, what they did was they piggybacked on it. And they assumed that they could minimize it, while still using it. And I mean, you just look at how Fox News, instead of being the propaganda arm for the GOP, became the like, the GOP. Yeah, like they started to dictate to the GOP, what was going to happen instead of the GOP, you know, telling them to make their point. Yeah, exactly. I mean, if you if you just go by, like the stated objectives of the GOP 40 years ago, it's insane to think that all of a sudden, now it is, you know, not just, you know, lip service to balancing the budget or anything like that. But they're using these cultural like, hey, no gays, no gays, as a way to get tax cuts for the rich. It's the culture war. Exactly. And it's the same, like if you get people to fight over dumb shit, you can trick them into voting against their own interests. Yep."
