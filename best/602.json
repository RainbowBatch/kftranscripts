These two cases, initially were the ones brought by Leonard Posner and Veronica Dela Rosa, and the one that was brought by Scarlett Lewis. It took a little bit longer for the news to break on it. But there's also a third case that Alex lost that day, which was brought by Neil Heslin. I wanted to get deeply into the weeds on this development, but you know how I am with these technical issues, sometimes dropped the ball. So I just kind of embarrassed myself. Sometimes I get emails from people who are like, You don't you don't know this term. I believe in our first deposition episode. I called the guy a prosecutor. Yes, I embarrass myself.

And in this case, when I'm sitting in that Jones deposition, and he is saying the most absurd stuff. Yeah, on some level, it's infuriating to watch him not take that process seriously. On the other hand, it's intensely rewarding when he says stuff like, oh, we ourselves, we never even investigated Sandy Hook. And thank you, Mr. Jones, thank you for telling me that. And that was was really good. But to circle back, because I haven't I haven't really answered your question is there done now. So this is over.

And in Connecticut, one of the big things that they're talking about, it's an interesting idea is that part of why Jones did this so often and so much is because he ultimately found it profitable is that if you can look at the records and see that sales for brain force and Male Vitality, were higher on the days that Sandy Hook was being discussed, then you can show a motive that he had to do it. But personally, I also believe you can look at this and see that his motive is genuinely that he started to hate these parents, that these these parents became genuine financial threats to him, because if they got strikes with YouTube, every time he put up a picture of their kids saying that they were fake, then pretty soon, just as we saw, he loses his life is, you know, livelihood in terms of YouTube. And he started to hate these parents. And for us that that really was his motive is that is I think there's a part of Alex Jones that knew it was trouble to keep talking about Sandy Hook this way and he just couldn't To help himself because he hated these people so much."

And then you just did it again. And at that point, even at that point, where we had gone through three cases with no discovery, child pornography had been produced, they had shown up to deposition twice and just totally ignored it. Nothing is going on, they still got another chance. They have to go on appeal, get this they could have completely won the case and dismissed all of these cases and still won on a legal argument which they didn't. But they got to do an entire another appeal, come back and then get another chance to answer discovery. And it was only after they didn't do that, that they were they were defaulted. So when I see Jones, for instance, getting on his show recently after this happened, and saying about how unfairly he's been treated, or What a travesty it is, I I've got to impress upon people, this does not happen and judges don't want to do it.

And I was actually looking forward to going toe to toe with somebody who thought that they were confident about this stuff and destroying them. And it didn't happen. I mean, instead, what we got from Jones was, you know, Jonesy, you've said this before, didn't you know, I never said that. Here's a video clip of you saying that that's edited. I didn't stance context. Media Matters, edited clips. So we're gonna say, Nike, you can't get anywhere like there was this idea to I think that was really observant of you both that there's some things you can accomplish, basically, in that situation, in terms of testimony there, there are some admissions you can get very quickly. But but that's done in 1520 minutes, really, like, there's not a lot of legal significance that can come out of that deposition, that that it happens very quick. But culturally, I think there is a lot of significance to that deposition. And I think you're gonna see that at this trial, too. So we'll we'll get we'll get some. And in other words, I don't want to say that the show is over, you know what I mean? Like, there is a reckoning for Jones, that's going to happen, and it's in, it's going to be personal.

Those are those are two families who were really heavily focused on, right like they put up the Posner's address to where they go pick up their mail. They said they were starting up anti First Amendment terrorist organization that was coming after Infowars. Viewers, they, they said the Neal Hudson was lying about holding his son with a bullet hole in the head, you know, like, it's this really personal crap. And so these clients are really stood up with their permission, because they were these personal targets, to be able to make this fight on behalf of everybody. And it's really been a brave struggle, particularly, you know, if Lynnie has been in this since the beginning. Yeah, within within a couple of weeks of this of the shooting, he wrote to Infowars and said, knock this off, why are you doing this? You know, this is Lenny is upfront about the fact that, you know, probably driving, once he dropped off that morning, he was driving away, he might have been listening to Infowars. He was actually kind of into that stuff, just because it was interesting to him. And to have these people stick because people don't want they sometimes don't realize is that we're talking about five years of straight harassment, followed by three years of the making a mockery of their lawsuits.

Understand that he said things about Sandy Hook, but probably think it was it was a handful of occasions over a couple of years, that kind of thing. I was questioning, yeah, questioning. So that's the other big one I have to address as well. But you'll notice that if you watched his statement about in reaction to these default judgments, one of the things he said is you know I only mentioned this a couple of times, only a few times that I ever talked about Sandy Hook, and we don't because of your audience may not realize but but because of we bringing the suit and then there shortly thereafter, YouTube and Facebook deleting all their profiles Infowars has a lost irreparably a lot of its videos and content, it can't tell us everything. So we've kind of had to play Sherlock Holmes using the public record and try to figure out what videos were made and when. And right now our best estimate is that they made 100 episodes about Sandy Hook that employers have seen the thing we know that they made about 350 pages of Infowars articles about Sandy Hook. And so this is we're averaging about two shows a month over the entire span. Now there are some times when he hits it like to 2015 and 2017 years really hitting it hard. So those those more times, but generally five years of the straight harassment that people just don't know unless you're a real me. Everybody's seen the Media Matters clips right But but God when you really dig in there, I'm telling you, you have to sit there and you have to watch an hour and a half of an unscripted conversation between Jones and Wolfgang Halbig that will fry you."

You've seen who he is, you know who this man is? Right? I wouldn't want to even use I mean, look, I would never normally say in a deposition. Look, you got 4000 emails from him and reading them, you would agree with me, this man is a raving lunatic. But I'd normally wouldn't use that kind of language. But Wolfgang, how big? And? You know, look, I don't I don't think that I think that that statement is a matter of my opinion. It's not a statement of fact. But if Wolfgang Halbig is upset about that, please, please sue me, Wolfgang, because you're a raving lunatic, and you have caused enormous pain to these families. And Jones knew that like, because that's my other problem is people. The number one question I get on these cases is, does Jones believe the things that he said, and all I can do is point you to the public record. That's all I can do is point you to the public record into the deposition transcripts. And I think it becomes very clear that no, he never for a second thought these things were fake. You know, Jones talks a lot about your one of the observations you made that was very, very observant was the the idea of the media jumping on with both feet of this idea that he said it was a psychosis. And it's not it's not really what he said. He was making a metaphor, and it kind of was still pretty crazy. And it was a dumb thing to say. But there are people out there there are people out there who popular institutions, and and the powers that be and then just the shitty deal you get in life in America has made them distrust basically all official sources of authority. There's no question that that's a real thing that happens to people that it's not happened to Alex Jones, no, he's done that to other people. Exactly. profiting off of that, understands that phenomenon and wants to inflame and exploit it and be able to profit from it. And he can point to that as a justification. But he is not one of those people. He does not have that psychosis. No, but I think shows us that it all was malicious, every bit of it was malicious."

And so maybe that'd be good, but no, no, it's not. And the problem is, is that Jones knows very acutely that his ability to identify mistakes made by the mainstream media is one of his best defenses is that if you overshoot the target on Jones, he uses that as a way to martyr himself. There was, in fact that so I was just talking about the Jim Fetzer verdict up in Michigan where there was, you know, one of his sources was was a lot of newspapers ran a story that that was Alex Jones, you'd got that.

And then six weeks later, you get the emails and it shows. No, they were still paying him through 2016. They fired him because he embarrassed them at a Trump rally. He was making some inappropriate comments to a female conservative journalist at a Trump rally and they were like, we can't have that anymore because we got to preserve our relationship with these conservative media outlets, and we got to make sure we can still get into Trump rallies. And so they didn't care that Dan Madani chased a bunch of people around Newtown, right. They didn't care. They hung out with Wolfgang Halbig.

And because right now he's in a situation where he's facing these charges for breach of basically federal trespassing wouldn't normally be that serious except he did it a year ago and didn't show up for community service.

We told the judge to look we're concerned not only about that deposition but that's why we want this deposition of Jones in October is because we're a little worried if you look onshore years arrest affidavit with all the pictures of Owen Shroyer being places he's not supposed to be.

But in Connecticut, they had asked him, it wasn't really Sandy Hook marketing materials. Basically what it was, is they wanted any, for any episode that Sandy Hook was discussed about. They wanted Infowars internal analytics, right? They want to know, what did they get off a Google ads, what did they get? How many hits? Did they get these sorts of things. And then Infowars also uses things like an internal Google Analytics program. It has some other metrics that it uses there. And they wanted to request all of that, which makes sense, pretty fair request, you got to know it, particularly the amount of views, right? Because if you want to establish how these people were damaged, you have to know how many people saw it. Right, like so. Ultimately, the total audience of Infowars is important. They asked for also, I think if they had if there were any emails that referred to special marketing initiatives for Sandy Hook, and by that, I mean, guys, we're gonna make a special promotional page or we're going to promote a can you make sure on this video, can you promote some Sandy Hook videos because they've been really popular?

And this guy said, Sandy Hook didn't happen. And everything she said about him was 100%. True. But she was using him very clearly as a campaign prompt to try to score some points. And I got no problem with that, whatever. But but once he did that, that enraged Jones, that was it, because Jones at that point was on this trajectory to become very mainstream. He had he had got Trump on his show, he was being credited at that time with Trump's victory. And so that's why just after the election, in November, right after the election, he did a broadcast called Alex Jones final statement about Sandy Hook. And basically, he couldn't stop talking about it, because Hillary talked about him. So he had to respond back. So his genius idea was to get on there and go, Well, look, here's all the reasons I thought it was fake. And, honestly, if it hadn't been for that, like some of this case would have never happened, right? If the parents they were of the position that if Jones had stopped after 2016, they probably wouldn't have pursued this. Right. But it was this vendetta that kept up is that not only did he do it, then, but then just a couple of months later, in the new year, in 2017, he did a video called Sandy Hook vampires exposed. Yeah, yeah, that's the one that accuses my clients of faking them. bluescreen ever. So here we are in 2017. And he just can't stop. Because He also posted these parents.

Just want to for the record, he imitated me first. So I think it's fair. He compared me to Gollum and said that I was a gremlin even said he was gonna make a little goblin Bankston doll and I just that hasn't happened yet. Because I'm I am number one who's gonna buy one? Oh, yeah. He started it. Okay, so I just I want that to be fair for the State Bar. He started it and in all seriousness, it has been a situation where his his public statements have been absurd. I've for somebody look, I have the opportunity to be on national television whenever I want. If somebody wants talk to Sandy Hook lawyer, it's gonna happen and I haven't done that. I've done it fairly infrequently. You know, I've when we first started I went on the Today Show the very first time I've done a PBS Frontline appearance about this issue to talk about it. But other than that, like we don't that's not where we're fighting this and I wanted to come talk about it with your audience because one your audience is never going to be on the jury if there's anybody who wants to know which fight they're getting taken off not gonna make very interest or strong feelings and Alex Jones you will not be on this jury. So I'm not worried about influencing the jury for anything that I did want to come talk about it with you all because I feel like this suit has been really interesting to the wider culture and not enough really hard analysis has been done on it not enough real attention has been paid to it. And I know y'all guys come out and like to have fun with it. But y'all are doing a really big service. A lot of people have learned a lot more about what the show really is from Norwich fight and I just wanted to thank you all for that"

The first is that he barely ever talked about Sandy Hook maybe just a few times. And he was just covering what the internet was saying. And then the second thing he's trying to claim is that the coverage of Sandy Hook was so unpopular that some of Alex's family disagreed with him, and staff almost quit because of it.

Alex's list of things he's questioned is a little bizarre, though. For one, I don't think he was the one who questioned the Gulf of Tonkin incident, if only because it happened 10 years before he was born."

Regardless of the attorney, defendants discovery abuse remained consistent. Also, the Huffington Post article that Alex is talking about, it wasn't quoting their top legal expert. They were quoting Bill Ogden, who's the lawyer at Ferrara and bell which is the law firm that Mark Bankston works at. He's Bill Ogden is the guy who he referenced was doing the Robinson deposition. Yeah. So their pictures are even right next to each other on the law firms website. This isn't a lawyer saying that this is just a legal theory.
