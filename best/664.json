Yes, that is an issue that is going to show you this. So that is a deposition that is related to the Marcel Fontaine case, which is a case where Kip Daniels wrote an article and posted it on Infowars where he missed identify the Parkland shooter based on a picture that he found on 4chan, right. And this is delved into deposition. Yes. And then the second deposition is Owen Shroyer is deposition in the Sandy Hook case in Texas. And so these are the two that we're going to get into. And interestingly, these are depositions that Mark Bankston didn't take No, he wasn't him. It was not the lawyer who was giving these and actually, he was well, it's Bill Ogden. He's co attorney for the plaintiffs. And so, you know, in our in our past episodes, you know, the last few at least, but you know, we're gonna have some deposition stuff to talk about sort of been our pattern to talk to the attorney who's giving the course holding the deposition inexplicably they want to talk to us it's very bizarre but that luck is gonna run out like there's no way that bill would want to come and have a conversation with us."

Oh, it's like yeah, I was live on air filling in for Alex, somebody who I don't remember handed me these documents and said, We already got the clips ready to go run the story from zero. And, and I'm like, so you're just a puppet. And he's like, I'm not a puppet. And I'm like, well, a puppet is somebody who conveys a message but someone else has control and Like he's like, Yeah. And I'm like, you're live on air. He's like, Yeah, I'm like, somebody hands you a story. You don't know what's in it. He's like, right. And I'm like, but they do. Yeah. So they have control of anything, right? And then you convey the message he's like, exactly. And I'm like, so you're a puppet. He was like, yeah, yeah, I am a puppet. It just goes to which like, This testimony is not supposed to exist, right? No one's ever supposed to say I'm above it. But this mark just goes on Ron Burgundy. And if you listen, it didn't make the transcript. But if you listen, you can hear it. And I was like, throughout all these depots, regardless of who's questioning the other person is literally they're just eating popcorn watching and trying to hold it down. And there's times where you can't. But But yeah, that's if you listen closely, you can hear the Ron Burgundy. And he wasn't trying to be disruptive or anything. It just had come to him. And he said it very quietly in my ear, and I just look at"

Before we get going, and now we will partake in a long, extended session of listening to him question idiot. Yep. That's the plan. So I decided that we're going to start with the kit Daniels deposition, because I think I think we can all agree that if this is the lineup have to no one's the headliner. Oh, yeah. And that is a sad state of affairs, but it's just the reality. So this was a deposition that was taken on February 28, February 17 of this year, and like I said, it has to do with the Parkland shooter Miss identification that Kate put in an Infowars article, where he misidentified the shooter as Marcel Fontaine, who is now suing Infowars. Yeah, I know that Owens probably more famous of a figure and that the Sandy Hook litigation is probably more primary in people's minds. But I've been thinking about it. And I think that this deposition is probably more revealing than many of the others that we've covered. Maybe not more than Daria, but it's up there. And most of what we revealed through darias was the cheese, a weirdo."

I worry that that sounds harsh now, but I assure you as we go through this, that assessment, I think is going to seem very fair. He doesn't seem to know or understand much, and because of that, he ends up getting himself into really bizarre places while being questioned under oath. Sometimes this dumbness intersects with a level of naivete. And in those places, Kitt doesn't seem like he realizes some of the stuff he's revealing about the inner workings of Infowars, which is wild. Yeah, a lot of that stuff may not be legally problematic, but it's definitely damning in the context of our show and what we cover. There's another aspect of this too, and it's something that Bill kind of touched on, which is that you kind of want to end up liking kit a little bit. He doesn't seem like such a bad guy a lot of the time, and it's clear lack of understanding about basic concept. It triggers a certain amount of pity in the viewer and the listener. Sure, those feelings are fairly complicated and weighed along with a clear awareness that he's been an employee at Infowars for like a decade, and he doesn't deserve the benefit of any doubts. It really makes a bizarre mix of of an experience right? And I think that that's definitely something that I found more interesting than I expected it to be right for someone who is essentially Infowars has its Boo Radley, if you will, well, he's not a franchise. He's a role player. You know, right. Right? I get what you mean. Yeah, he's a you feel complicated things about who read. Exactly, yes, sure. Yes. And yeah, I think there's a lot to a lot to dig here. So let's, let's just jump right in. And we learn right at the beginning. There's obviously like a lot of preliminary conversation in any deposition, talking about past employment, how long have you worked in floors?

Alex can't curate that shit himself. And if you were forced to report on articles without tailor made headlines for him to yell about his show suffer from that. The people who write the articles and who repost other outlets articles with New headlines are really the backbone of what makes Alex's show function. And with Paul Joseph Watson doing a lot less of that heavy lifting in the past few years, someone like Kip probably does have real value. Compare what someone like him brings to the table to someone like Owen or Harrison, I think you would rather have kid around just about any day."

And even though I'm philosophically opposed to them, I would offer Harrison I wouldn't give him anything past an unpaid internship. The thing that I find really interesting about this clip, and so many other moments in this deposition is the clear information based power imbalance between the lawyer and the person being deposed. Ken has no idea that Infowars is deeply in debt. Later, Owen is going to talk about how he has no idea what archives or databases the company keeps, and no one told him that he received a court order for discovery in this case. This is because Infowars is a deeply compartmentalised workplace. Alex keeps so much information from the people who work there, you can see folks being completely caught off guard to hear these kinds of revelations in a deposition setting. And that's for this debt. I'm not really sure how much of this is just normal for a business, right? Yeah, but it seems pretty high. Yeah. Alex sucks at business. So I could see him being really deep in the soup. But I don't know what the fuller picture of this is. Until Until more information comes out. But taken at face value, it's obviously surprising to kit. Sure. And it sounds bad. Yeah."

Kit believes that he has to rush out stories whether they're accurate or not, because the audience is fickle, and they won't care tomorrow about what happened today. But the reality is that he has this relationship backwards. Infowars has cultivated and trained this response from their audience through the constant bombardment of flashy headlines and imminent predictions of terrorist nukes and FEMA camps. Everything that's happening today is reported as cataclysmic because it needs to be to capture the maximum amount of attention. And if you want a chance at retaining any eyeballs tomorrow, the headlines better be just as flashy. And just as severe, and probably not about the same thing you were yelling about the day before. That's not going to be as exciting. No, Alex is trained isn't his audience partially because it's easier, and partially because he can't operate any other way. If Infowars took the time to flesh out stories and do follow up reporting just about everything they cover would be revealed to be bullshit and they'd spent all their time on error correcting the shit they said yesterday, which might be an interesting show. I think it would be as a like a sketch. Yeah,"

      "text": "So the second thing that kid is revealing is the internal way that Infowars kind of understands that metaphor that I refer to as the wet concrete thing. Propaganda narratives really only stick if you're able to implant them early, you need to have something happen, and then provide the narrative for your audience to understand the event through, if you can get succeed at that your audience will be more likely to evaluate any further things they hear about the event through the prism of your conspiracy narrative, as opposed to looking at the details independently. This is a critical aspect of getting narratives to stick. And I think the kit is reflecting the basic understanding of this, but just from the producer side, he wouldn't want to think that that's what he's doing because it's inherently abusive to an audience, and it's entirely dishonest. But this is that dynamic. When he says that the audience wouldn't be interested in old news, what he's actually saying is that by the time stories, a few days old, the concrete is already dried, and whatever angle he's going to try and sell, it isn't going to stick. The thing I find the most fascinating about this perspective is that I completely agree with just about everything that kid is describing in terms of what whether or not the audience would care about a couple days old news story. The we have a fundamental disconnect in terms of why I blame Infowars and Alex, whereas it seems to blame the audience. Well, yeah, how they're fickle."

      "text": "my boss. So this may not be as relevant in a legal setting. But this clip is super important for my interest. Oh, yeah. I have found that the methodology for how Infowars works as a broadcast is that Alex will use Infowars articles, specifically their headlines to build his on air narratives. Oftentimes, these headlines do not accurately reflect the body of the article but are worded specifically in a way so that they can be useful to whatever conspiracy Alex is trying to prove or demonstrate on air. In some cases, these are just fully in house articles. And in other cases, there are articles from other outlets where the body of the article is copy pasted onto the Infowars site, and a wholly new headline is attached to make it more useful for Alex. The revelation that Alex is directly telling his Managing Editor what headlines to put on stories is basically the piece that completes the circle of Alex just making all this shit up. He's on air pretending to cover news stories, but in reality, it's just him yelling about headlines that he's told his employees to put on stories so he can more easily yell about them. This is a completely self contained information space where everything is just basically Alex's whim. It was pretty clear that this was what was going on. But it seems like a much more reasonable assumption to think that like the in house culture was just that employees knew what Alex wanted and then they provided it right? Maybe some subtle prodding happened, like, if you didn't take the right angle Rob do would scold you, or you wouldn't get as big of a raise. That's kind of what I assumed was happening. That would make sense. And it would be enough to get the message across. And ultimately, the people who did the right job would stick around, or the people who didn't fit that company culture, they wouldn't last. To me, it's an entirely different ballgame for Alex to be actively directing the production of the news he's covering and having an active role in the creation of the headlines, which are the only parts of the story he ever really covers. Given this workflow. Like, what story could Alex not manufacture? All he needs is an Infowars article to justify anything you might say on air, and he could just tell one of his mopey underlings to create that for him, and from kids telling of it these underlings know better than to not give Alex what he wants. Yep. That's fucked up."
