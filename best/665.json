Actually, when you find out the album you will think otherwise. But he know it's Robert Glasper who is one of my favorite jazz pianists. So the 1970s nosey album is from a couple months ago. Okay. And Robert Glasper though is specific because he works in r&b a lot. He provides a lot of hooks he provides all kinds of stuff for all kinds of people but he is himself an incredibly talented jazz pianist and songwriter and I fucking love it."

Yeah, that that prompted a lot of this. And so that's that's pretty interesting position. And I'm excited for a couple things, particularly something that we're gonna get to do pretty, pretty early.

There is my job responsibilities have changed and as much as I'm on air a lot more now. Right. So that that seems pretty clear. So as we know, from listening to the show, around this time period, before Owen got hired, he was a guy who would call into Alex's show every now and again, not as a guest, but as just a random caller. At the same time, he was posting videos on YouTube where he would go and antagonize left leaning protesters, which was probably way more important for his portfolio than any of the sports journalism work he had done in the past very much. So if you go back to before he worked at Infowars, you can actually find some interesting things. For instance, you can find some coverage of him protesting police tyranny in the wake of the Michael Brown killing in Ferguson, Missouri, just outside his hometown of St. Louis. Interestingly, if you consult this press coverage, including an article in the St. Louis Post Dispatch, you find that oh and wasn't totally forthcoming when Bill in this deposition asked him about his previous employment before he got to working at Infowars Oh, and since then, he was doing sports journalism, some youth development some odd jobs like wedding DJing. But there's something you didn't mention. It's probably not material as an omission. Like he was hiding something. But before Infowars Oh, and hosted a talk show from 10 to midnight on 1380 am in St. Louis. Okay. As is the case with a lot of radio stations. 1380 am went through a lot of format changes over the course of its lifetime. Sure, it had stretches in the top 40 station, a gospel outlet and a couple runs as sports talk. But just prior to 2014, it had one of the most bizarre radio formats I've ever heard. This station, with the call letters KF xn was a sister station with another talk station out of St. Louis. KF ns. These two stations decided to brand themselves, the man and the woman with each broadcasting talk radio shows they thought would appeal to either men or women."

This was when Owen had a time slot on air. And if you take what he's saying in the St. Louis Post Dispatch article about his protesting in Ferguson at face value, he doesn't seem like he's necessarily the worst person you would encounter on an extreme talk station. He was out at the i 64. Overpass with a sign saying, quote, tyranny is here. And his goal was protesting the government overreach in the aftermath of the shooting. He told the papers that the protesters quote, don't deserve tear gas and guns pointed at them, which would sound fine if we didn't have natural suspicions based on where his career ended up leading it. Well, there's that the extreme talk station didn't work out, at least partially due to the complete chaos of the person running the company that owned the station, a guy named Dan Marshall,"

The first is that Owen is so clearly grasping at straws to explain his video, which is a very strong indication that he knows that the content he was involved in putting out was horrible and indefensible. In order to make it defensible. You have to pretend it with something else entirely. The second thing is at the beginning, oh, and tries to evade the question by saying he didn't remember his exact quote. But then when he's trying to build a rationalization for what he said, When you know, it wasn't actually bad. He appeals to how people need to look at the exact quote, in the space of about a minute he went from not remembering what he said to insisting everyone judge him by the exact wording of what he said. It's painfully obvious what game he's playing. Yeah. The underlying point that I was trying to make is that he wasn't saying that Neil Heslin couldn't have held his on after the shooting. He was saying that Mr. Heslin is claim made on making Kelly's show was impossible if the video and played of the new town coroner was accurate. Oh, and it's claiming that his point was that this is an inconsistency that Megan Kelly did in fact, check for her piece. And because of that, it'll feed into conspiracies, which Oh, one is pretending as a bad thing, as opposed to the only reason anyone would pay him $100,000 A year. Yeah, this is obvious nonsense.

      "text": "this is such a simple question and line of questioning. And Owen would lose nothing by just saying that he's not informed about the case. But there's a weird dynamic with Infowars, where attitude is just as important or more important than content. And somebody like Owen has been trained to resist ever showing his ass. He made his name by going into hostile territory and arguing with people he was calling them cucks. So even though he's in a completely different setting here, that mode is still a part of how he interacts. I suspect that no one's afraid to come out and say that he's not informed about Sandy Hook, because he's worried that the next question will be, why aren't you informed about Sandy Hook? And he doesn't have a really good question. Good answer for that. If you're humble, why wouldn't you learn a little bit about the case? He's been in a lawsuit for a while and beyond that Sandy Hook is a big deal in online conspiracy communities that make up a large part of his audience. So it seems like he'd be curious at least, to admit to being uninformed about Sandy Hook reveals a lack of curiosity and a lack of interest in knowing things which is countered how Infowars hosts are supposed to position themselves in terms of branding. It also opens up a line of questions that aren't going to come up in this deposition. But Owen is still probably worried about answering, namely, whether or not he's informed on many of the other topics he covers, like, for instance, is he informed on the Gulf of Tonkin incident? Could Owen coherently explain what happened there beyond just the catchphrase version of like, the government lied to get us into the Vietnam War? I would suspect not. And one of the really important aspects of Infowars kayfabe is the image that the people working there know a lot about the things that they talk about. Also, not knowing a child's name is that's actively disrespectful on Owens part. If you were truly someone who made an honest mistake and covered the story wrong and ended up hurting this grieving father, you would think that oh, and would have familiarized himself a little bit with the circumstances, if only to be able to fully apologize for the, the pain he caused. And that's clearly not something that he's felt inclined to do."

He said that free speech and his understanding involves the right to speak without inherent consequence. And I say what the fuck does that even mean? Right? All speech has consequences because speech is a means of conveying things between persons. If you tell someone you love them that has a consequence, which will depend on how they feel about you could be a good consequence or a negative one, but something happens. Similarly, if you yell a racial slur at someone, there's always a consequence. Maybe you get hit or maybe that person is restrained, but there's still a consequence of emotional pain that's been inflicted. it, there is no speech without consequence, because speech doesn't exist in a vacuum. The reason that I think this is really fascinating is because I wasn't understanding of this is that free speech is speech without inherent consequences. When it's he who's speaking, there isn't a concern at all for the consequences experienced by the other people involved in the speech. It's really just a childish mentality that kind of boils down to I get to say, whatever I want, if anyone's mad about it, they're oppressing me. I understand. And I appreciate the desire and even the necessity of protecting speech from too much censorship, but to not really understand the dynamic nature of speech, particularly when you work at a place called free speech systems. That just strikes me as the mark of a very shallow selfish mind. That grasping, like the legal definition of free speech involves the government. Yeah. And the concept of free speech between persons, always as a consequence, yeah, it may not be you get sued every time. But there's a consequence."

What's remarkable about this is that it's wholly reliant on Oh, and having no idea who gets sued for what no clue it's solely based on a feeling and that feeling is aggrievement. Oh, and and everyone at Infowars feels like they're the victims of society. And so assumptions are made in order to prop up that feeling. Instead of asking yourself, if other people get sued for doing the things that you've done, it feels more satisfying to assume that they don't, and you're only getting sued because everyone's against you. Now, the reason that I think this is so revealing is because it's an instance of Owen speaking to the identity and definition of Infowars. It's something that's at the root of why he thinks Infowars is different than other media outlets, because they're victims of an unfair game persecution, yes, this completely inaccurate feeling is part of how Oh, and identifies Infowars and how they're different from CNN. This makes total sense to me. And I think that this feeling is almost comically present in their broadcast, but it's a little shocking to see it articulated by Oh, in in a deposition. Yeah. Infowars isn't different from the mainstream media because they cover the stories that no one else will. They're not different because they have actual deep level sources who feed them solid Intel. They're different because they believe incorrect things that make them self identify as the victims of society. It's really just very angsty and childish at its core. And it really does explain Owens early career as a self described cook destroyer. It's just a child. Yes. It's just this is just childish shit."
