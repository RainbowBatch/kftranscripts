He says a lot of stuff. That's true. But it's just crazy. You know, talking about optics, I saw a story over the weekend, about Vladimir Putin and Berlusconi, the former president of Italy, and then Eastern Ukraine and Crimea at a famous vineyard. And they weren't, they opened up a bottle of 1000s of bottles of wine that were there that was 210 years old. You can just type in Putin, and Berlusconi in Ukraine probe for drinking Crimea wine. And this is a stunt they know, will reach out to the proletariat. At the time that that bottle of wine was court was produced Russia fully controlled Ukraine and fully controlled Crimea waiting there was part of Russia, that they're claiming that Putin and Berlusconi stole a bottle of wine. It was part of a PR stunt is promoting local Ukrainian wine, like, Oh, we're here with the farmers. Yes. Why and why it's very old. And then they reduce it down to the ultimate crime. BBC, CNN, Fox News, Associated Press, Reuters, French news agencies that Vladimir Putin is there looting the Ukrainian wine. The globalist overthrew the country two years ago, they put it into civil war, they appointed a government. They're bombing and shelling all over the country.

And they go, No, she doesn't, I'm not gonna do it. So they drag her out of the car. And they find the Patriot Games and they start freaking out and getting scared. Just says the word patriot. And it's like a satire piece. You can't believe they're acting. This shilly this freaked out this crazy. And then they flip out from there and get the banner in our trunk and I find canning supplies. They think that's really evil. And then they find a pocket constitution. And they go oh my god. Is this legal? And then a supervisor comes and says she may be allowed to have that. Maybe that's what she talks about how she's got a constitution. That may be what she means. But look, we'll just take her to jail and find out is it legal out? Oh, no. Here are guys that have sworn an oath to protect and defend the Constitution Bill of Rights Declaration of Independence is the whole foundation of the country. And I'm not making fun of them.

Wow, you remember that night story but that conspiracy of silence Yeah, documentary that's fucked up. Yeah, it is super fucked up.

So I mean, there are a lot of problems with it, but it doesn't procure there's no indication of that at all investigations have been done. And like past investigations have shown as in the case of the Boystown situation that that was what was going on.

I hear there's a rumor that there may be more shocking development from the second mile foundation and hold on to your stomach boys because this is gross. I will use the language I can that Sandusky in the second mile were pimping out young boys to rich donors that was being investigated by two prominent colonists even as I speak. How does that sentence start? I have a rumor. So when he was pressed on it, he said this. I normally abhor giving rumors credence, but the whole Sandusky scandal started out as a rumor, it gets deeper and more disgusting all the time. It's a rumor. It's a rumor that some radio host put out into the world and Alex Jones has been peddling his entire worldview about these pedophiles and the REN fields and Dracula's basically on this, this is pizza gate shit. This is that level of like internet marberry the idea like I'm not trying to defend Sandusky or Joe Paterno, or anybody involved in this. They're all fucking awful monsters. No, I hope they all die twice. Absolutely. And clearly indications have come out the Joe Paterno was aware of this dating back to the seven Yeah, he knew like he's not innocent in any of this. So I'm not at all giving them a pass. What I am saying is it's irresponsible journalism on Alex Jones as part to try and create this broader spiderweb that's going on when in the truth. It's just, it's just a monster we can tell is it's one monster who is looking for his own victims. Yeah. So I I don't think in terms of official information. And maybe maybe there is something out there that I'm unaware of. And if that's the case, please feel free to tell me, but from what I've been able to glean the idea that there was procurement and pimping out of these children goes back to rumours as opposed to actual truth. Yeah. And like Alex, you got to do better, you got to do better. I understand that you want to launch conspiracy theories, and you want people to distrust mainstream narratives. You can't you can't just do this you really sensationalized a real problem to the point where you lose your credibility about that real problem right."

But even even that is him recognizing that as a hiding Jew during the Holocaust. George Soros had no ability to buck the system at all. Alex Jones is recognizing that. And he's still lying about what George Soros did, because he's still saying that he rounded up Jews and stuff like that, which he absolutely didn't. He bases all of this on a 60 Minutes interview that has nothing to do with this stuff. It's all bullshit. But be that as it may, I think it's particularly disgusting, that he recognizes that it would be certain death for George Soros to do anything out of line. And he's like, Yeah, pissy, I would have taken death. Yeah. All right, Alex, you're a liar. First of all. And second of all, how dare you? How dare you insult someone's decision in that kind of a situation? The only way you can do that is if you kind of deny the Holocaust. And it was mostly about Jews that didn't pay ransom. Yeah, that's really the only way you can do that. And not think of yourself as a fucking horrible person. Anyway, this clip from the show is he has an interview with a guy named Joe Banister, who Alex presents him as a guy who the government tried to shut down his free speech. I don't know his whole history, I don't really care. It's not important to what's going on. The two of them have an interview. And the pope comes up. And Joe Banister has a pretty decent argument, and a pretty decent position. And then Alex makes an incredibly startling admission."

One, whenever Alex Jones does one of those voices he's like, right, you can tell because that's a rhetorical trick he uses. Second, when he starts putting on the Malcolm X impression, you can tell that something's going on there, you can tell that he's full of shit and probably in a weird headspace because, you know, his rhetoric, you know, the tools that he employs, and if students in primary education would be taught those sorts of things, you'd be much more able to see a politician and be like, Oh, hold on now.

In many ways. Whatever he's talking about Atlantis is very unspecific, but he talks about it, like the destruction of Atlantis was the punishment of God, because they were too warlike. They went around and they disrespected the will of the gods, they fucked with the Athens was too much. So they got destroyed by the gods, because they became too decadent.
