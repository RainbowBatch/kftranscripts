So there could be no confusion when they sat down at this deposition chair, what you are expected, right? And the like, the judge was laying out these are the minimum requirements were right. This really was an act of generosity on the part of the court. This is the judge from that hearing, quote, I think where I'm struggling is actually I actually believe we're most likely to end up in a situation where I'm going to be telling the jury, we gave the defendants all these opportunities to answer these questions. And you may decide from the answers they gave or did not give that had they answered those answers would hurt their case, or some language to that effect.

In the hearing. After Darrius deposition, the judge asked Alex's counsel, quote, do you know who will be designated or if there will be more than one person designated to respond to these topics? The response was, quote, I will have the answer for that by the end of today, and I'm relatively certain it will be more than one person. That would have been a good idea. And for whatever reason, Alex and free speech systems decided not to designate more than one person, they chose to leave this one person Brittany paws to be responsible for answering to all the questions in both of these cases, which honestly isn't fair. I don't have a ton of pity for Miss paws. But it would also be dishonest to not recognize that her inability to do her job in these depositions was part of an intentional choice that Alex made. If there's 10s of 1000s of pages of material to become familiar with having one person do that is an act of sabotage, especially when the opportunity was readily available to split the workload up between multiple representatives, sending one person with two weeks prep time is not an act of cooperation.

Here's what the judge said specifically about the responsibility that the corporate representative would have regarding matters involving preservation of evidence, quote, If she shows up again, or I'm sure we'll get a new, one new corporate representative, because that's the way this works. And that person says, I don't know, then they will have disregarded the orders I'm making today, your client will have violated the orders that I'm making today. I don't want I don't know, I'm guessing, I think maybe or I infer to be a part of the answer at all. So if the answer is we destroy everything as fast as we can, then I want them to come out and say that? And if their answer is we don't care where it comes from. So we don't ever create a record of they don't need to say that in that way. Alex's lawyer responded with just one word. Understood. Already, Miss pas has stepped in it. And it showed that the direct orders of the judge are not being followed, whether through negligence and on like unawareness on her part, or as a result of Alex's hostility to the process.

Clearly, the representative who was sent did not even try to determine what the company news and she had no knowledge of documents that were provided by the company. She was their representative and the discovery of in these cases, so I consider it to be the minimum efforts or the corporate representative to review every document produced by the company in this litigation prior to their deposition. When Daria did her deposition, she had no awareness of documents that free speech systems had produced relating to their knowledge of the plaintiffs. And so as part of Alex getting another chance to provide a corporate rep, they were going to be required to review all the documents that involve this subject. As is painfully obvious from this exchange, Miss pas did not do that. This is clear specifically as it relates to Mr. Heslin. Because just as one example we have from prior depositions, the company produced an email that David Knight sent to himself with the subject line, quote, Connecticut carry releases the troubled past of Neil Heslin. From before the lawsuit. There was also that email that David Knight sent himself with the subject line quote, Neil Heslin, father of Sandy Hook, victim phases, criminal charges, which he sent to himself one night at three in the morning, before the lawsuits, we already have a concrete demonstration that two of the judges specific demands have not been respected. And we are not very far into this thing. No, it is just clear. And yeah, I don't know. It's, it's,"

She has no idea what Miss Lewis's charity is about, but she thinks it has to do with school safety in a way that you could imply that it's secretly about gun control. It's something that people could have different opinions on depending on your interpretation. And then after going aways down that road, she learns that it's actually a charity about fostering emotional intelligence and young students, then she was forced to stick with that premise that she's already established. And now she's left with an unfortunate and uncomfortable decision. She can either admit that she had no idea what she was talking about, and was making up assessments that she made earlier, or she has to stick to her guns and imply that this charity that's about teaching the core values of like kindness and forgiveness is secretly a gun control front that Ms. Lewis is being dishonest about, right? You can hear Mark kind of laughing periodically in this and it's because of things like this, it feels like even at this point, he's pretty sure this deposition isn't going to be productive and likely is going to lead to more sanctions."
