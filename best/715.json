Oh, and Dr. Dan Norton. Dan, Jordanne quick question for you. So it's a great spot today, my bright spot today, Jordan, we are recording this late due to some logistics. Ooh. And so I can say that my bright spot is that we just got done recording the majority report. I guess it was live as well. Yeah. But yeah, it's I didn't get a chance to say some gushy things that I might have wanted to hear. But the that show was very important. I think early on, during during the show, a lot of people asked me like, how do you stay sane, right, listening to all this Alex and one of the things that was really critical for me was, there is a groundedness to reality in a lot of the interviews that Sam and the CO hosts do with people are surrounding like, you know, some political things and policy issues. And I found that to be very comforting in the same way that like, I don't know, my parents listening to and watching like the MacNeil Lehrer our show it was a kid. Well, it's"

That took us to Thursday afternoon and the next day the trial entered the punitive phase which ended before we entered the weekend. On this episode, we're gonna pick up where we left off in tune into Alex's show the morning of that Friday, August 5, and track the response is the reality of the punitive damages sets in and he has to wrestle with a very large weight that he is now carrying, both in terms of financial consequences, as well as the potential fallout from his texts being accidentally turned over to opposing counsel and what that could mean for his future."

In the real world. This question was part of a setup for a trap that Alex walked himself into, which helped impeach him as a credible witness in the trial. Alex is a painfully unserious person. And this should be a great example of that. What you said isn't threatening to anyone, it evoked more rolled eyes than anything else in the courtroom. And it was part of a line of questioning that was pretty effective in demonstrating that Alex was not at all a good faith participant in the trial, and that his testimony was not something the jury should be taking at face value. But it has the appearance of being something that owns the LIBS or something. So people made memes and Alex decides to start his show with it, because that's great."

So there's renewed conversation about it, including discussion of the coming second season and the cannibalism scene in the first episode. That apparently wasn't even explained by the season finale. People are talking about this show that they're enjoying. So the New York Times published an op ed about a couple of pieces of cannibalism related creative works that have come out recently, seemingly building on the premise that cannibalism is a hot topic in fiction these days. Naturally, the right wing went batshit over this and graded the entire news cycle based on the nonsense idea that the times was trying to tell people that cannibalism is actually really cool. And maybe they usually people. Alex is a shallow thinker and a shallower reader, so he's not read this Op Ed and I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't even read the full text of the breathy breathlessly outraged response articles that were written about it. But if he had read the original thing, he would have read this part towards the end. Quote, according to miss summers, cannibalism is always symbolic. For her novels protagonist eating human flesh can be seen as a way of holding on to a relationship that ended for Miss summers herself. The plot of a certain hunger can't be uncoupled from quote my own personal experiences with disordered eating, with the tamping down of feminine appetites, the way the media chews up and spits out writers bougie consumption and bougie lady consumption, she said, more generally, Midsummers thinks that the recent spate of cannibalistic blots could be commentaries on capitalism, quote, cannibalism is about consumption, and it's about burning up from the inside in order to exist. Burnout is essentially over consuming yourself your own energies, your own will to survive your sleep schedule, your eating schedule your body. The article is a thoughtful examination of some of the social commentaries that are possibly being made by themes of cannibalism that are being expressed in a very limited set of pieces of media, including a very popular recent series. But of course, for people like Alex, it's secretly The Times telling everyone that eating people is trendy now. This is idiotic kid shit. That's like, but it's fun. Yeah, like, at least at least it's something"

Instead, there's just dozens of cameras, but they're all pet media. And they all run the same script. And I'll put the same clips out basically. And the judge sits there while she controls the YouTube stream, turning it on and turning it off and turning it on and turning it off. She got a little brain. She just kills the stream. She's up there like a DJ running. So either you're gonna show people the trial or don't but I think it's illegal to claim someone's televised and then only let out certain parts of the trial but when something you don't watch happens, you kill the stream and then turn it back on the other side speaking. And then Bankston. Their main lawyer gets up the plaintiff's lawyer the ambulance chaser and goes Listen, Judge I want you to not kill the stream during this part because I'm gonna expose it law enforcement at once Jones's phone and you know, he's going down and it's January 6, and all this stuff.

He sounds like someone raving about black helicopters, because he's literally the same person who was raving about black helicopters 20 years ago. He's delusional. And he's found enough people to enable and reinforce his delusions that he's been able to make it profitable and insulate himself from any consequences of his actions. But this just sounds dumb. Alex is getting on his show to complain about how unfairly he's being treated, which is evidenced by a completely inaccurate description of how the livestreams are broadcast. Then he's heard from other people that there's a conspiracy about silencing supportive YouTube comments, which is just pathetic. Alex isn't even able to make this claim he has to say that other people have told him this is happening. He has literally no idea if this is real at all, but it feeds into his victimhood status. So not only is it real, it's also probably way worse than it seems. And it's being directed by the judge in coordination with Soros. On the live streams, commenting was disabled for obvious reasons. As far as the lawn crime videos are concerned, you can go to those and still see a ton of pro Alex comments, mostly in the live chat. It's silly to think that YouTube comments mean anything. A lot of them are bots. Many of them are people just trolling and there are plenty that just don't even make sense. It's really sad to see a 48 year old adult whining on his show, but how he's heard there aren't enough positive comments about him on some YouTube videos. So it must be a censorship conspiracy issue. It's nonsense. It's just pathetic."

This one was about Magnus Soderlund to went on Swedish TV and was interviewed about some research he was doing into social taboos about food sources. Basically, human meat was used as an extreme example of something that pretty much everyone considered past the line. But where exactly was the line? Lab grown beef, artificial meat insects where, you know, where do people feel like, I don't know. He doesn't want people to eat people. And that wasn't something he was advocating at all. Magnus very astutely deduced that his words had, quote, been hijacked by people who don't believe that global warming and other climate issues should be taken seriously.

It's less a question of remotely controlling smart meter thermostats, and more City Council's being asked to do everything they can to conserve energy. After this is a string of headlines about reducing car ownership. So I guess that a bunch of these headlines could be said to be connected, but I'm struggling to make the larger meaningful connection. And the cannibalism is just flashy and fun. I guess. I think that I understand what Alex wants the connection to be, but it's pretty much just in his head. He's basically laying out the climate change advocates. It's an elaborate plot to destroy society through making people unable to have energy resources, which will make them unable to get any food. So I guess the media is trying to prepare people for the idea of eating other humans. Mind you. This is entirely different than Alex's big rant about how he was willing to barbecue his neighbors to feed his children. When Alex discusses cannibalism, that's actually genius. And he's making a larger point whereas when people he doesn't like do it, it's proof of insidious plan to depopulate the planet. Yeah, this list of headlines is legitimately depressing.

Well, it is true that parts of the Great Barrier Reef are seeing considerable healing. That's not true of the reef as a whole. The northern area of the reef saw gains in hard coral cover, but the southern section actually went down. This is good news, but it's part of a larger picture. One of the main concerns about the reef is hard coral cover. But another equally important aspect is bleaching. Bleaching is the result of a temperature or weather anomaly that leads to the coral expelling the algae that give it its color resulting in the coral becoming white. It's not dead at that point, but it's at a significantly greater risk. And importantly, reefs are complicated systems that are capable of healing. So if there is some bleaching the coral can become home to algae again and come back to what you call like a vibrant life. Right, right. Right. The concern among scientists is that weather events that cause large scale bleaching have been increasing in frequency. There have been four mass bleaching events in the past seven years and experts don't know how resilient the reefs are to this heightening pressure. It's an open question. It's frightening. The implications. Yeah, another aspect that is of concern is mentioned in a Reuters story about this. Quote, on the downside, the growth in cover has been driven by acro paura corals, which the Australian Institute of Marine Sciences said, are particularly vulnerable to wave damage, heat stress, and crown of thorns starfish. This is coral cover that is increasing, which is good, but it's a type of coral that's highly likely to be susceptible to the sorts of weather events that are becoming increasingly common, which is a big reason to be worried. This increase in cover could lead to false hope, or conversely to people like Alex ignoring the details of the story, in order to use it as a prop to attack climate science as invalid. As per usual, Alex has no idea what he's talking about. But he's got a Breitbart headline, and that's enough to trick his audience into pygmies and expert. So Whoo,"

Dammit Alex probably just saw a headline about research that was done at Rice University where they found that they could use dead spiders as a way of gripping things. Essentially it has to do with how spider legs bend and how all you really need to do to manipulate them is apply a hydraulic pressure inside the spider's abdomen. The researchers used a needle to puff air into them and found that they were able to expand and retract the spiders legs. Personally, I think this is a little fucked up. But I don't know how much of a high horse any of us has to be about like oh, you're gonna risk Like the sanctity of dead spider Yeah, no, I'm not sure it's weird, but it's pretty interesting if"

As for the big thing, Alex just skimmed a headline about this, but it's a little closer to reanimation. It's not, it's just not that it's a pig getting reanimated. It's a cellular thing. Oh, this has some considerable philosophical implications and could stand to revolutionize processes used in organ donation. But it's not Frankenstein, or at least not yet. I do find myself unnerved slightly by this portion of an NBC News article about this quote, the pigs treated with organics startled researchers. During the experimentation the dead pigs heads and necks moved under their own. The animals remained under heavy anesthesia. The researchers do view the neck jerk as an indication that muscle function was restored after death. If you're someone who believes that all science fiction is secretly real, I can see how you might respond to this like Alex does. It's silly, but I get it. Yeah, anyway, I'm still having trouble with the suppose connection of all these stories. Even these two stories allegedly about reanimation aren't connected in any meaningful way. At this point, I was so bored of this list of headlines that I was getting. It's getting really redundant. So I decided it was time to move on from this fun run. Yeah, but that story about the pigs is like that is something I wish someone who was like Alex but not Alex. Yeah. Then maybe a little bit more in touch with reality. Yeah, could have a take on because I think it's I think it's a little bit like your reaction is there is a place for that. Right? They right now to restore muscle."

Yeah, the last one where he was going to prove that China's stole the election was a complete disaster. And this one is not going to go better. I went to the website for this summit, and there's actually a really fitting image on the landing page. It's Mike standing in front of Mount Rushmore waving an American flag. Conveniently he's obscuring Lincoln's face with that flag, something of a symbolic expression intentional or not, of his and his movements desire to rerun the Civil War and undo the whole emancipation thing. Yep. On day one of the summit Lindahl is going to have a premiere screening of the film selection code which goes into how the election was stolen. It was funded by Lynn Dell and largely is about Tina Peters, who you may remember as the election fraud conspiracist, who is arrested for allegedly facilitating a security breach in May 2021. She was a county clerk in Mesa, Arizona and in her capacity there she enabled data from the election to be leaked and ultimately published on a Q anon telegram channel. She recently lost an election she was in running for secretary of state. She lost in the GOP primary only getting 27% of the vote. But of course, she insists that she won and the election was stolen because why not? Yeah. Anyway, Lyndale paid to make a movie about her and he's airing it at his big summit. Then on day two, we get something truly exciting that I might actually tune in for from 11am to 6:30pm we have the trial of the machines except on the site they misspelled trial so it actually says trail of the machine. Oh my god, there's no explanation for this other than quote Michael and Dell puts the voting machines on trial. Seven and a half hours. It's gonna be madness."

The courtroom was designed like a set with three big movie cameras with the judge alternating the what could be said and when it could be said and how it could be said and who could who could say it in such a way that had nothing to do with the rules of evidence. Nothing to do with the rules of law in Texas.

Anyway, I was in the courtroom for a lot more of the case than media star Bobby Barnes. And I can say very clearly and with no hesitation that The courtroom was not laid out like a movie set, and it wasn't following a script. I get that that's convenient narrative for him and Alex to push because they lost and the fallout from this case is going to be spectacular. But this is a weak attempt at damage control or whatever they're doing. For one thing, there were a few cameras in the courtroom, like I mentioned, but they weren't all the same people's cameras, right. One was the court zoom camera. One is the law on crime feed. There were HBO cameras for the documentary. And on that note, there was a sign on the door to the courtroom that advise people that there was a crew from HBO filming, and if they didn't consent to be in the background or shots, they shouldn't come in. Beyond that there really wasn't much of an effect that the cameras had on the actual case. Nope. The place where cameras were much more involved in making a scene relates to Alex's actions. On the first Tuesday, the first day of the case proper Alex held a mini press conference in the hallway for all the cameras yelling about how he'd been railroad and how this is a show trial. That was the video where we're standing in the background. Yes, people remember that? Yeah. After being scolded about how that wasn't appropriate. At lunch. Alex tried to do it all again in front of the courthouse, but there was no one there to watch him have a tantrum. Alex wanted a show trial vibe. He wanted there to be tons of national media crews there covering the case. But he didn't get that. I think it's instructive to understand that this complaint that there were all these cameras is actually expressing Alex and Barnes's disappointment, that there weren't cameras there that they could exploit for their own purposes. It's less about the cameras and more about how they weren't able to control the narrative, which is something that they're fully used to being able to do within the Infowars bubble. A judge pushing back on that need for Alex to control all aspects of how he's allowed to speak or present himself is seen as her trying to create a false narrative, which makes total sense. actual reality encroaching on the fake reality he lives in is experienced as an attack, because it's the only way that fake reality can maintain its existence."

I would hate to hear that Alex was forced to quarter any soldiers during the trial he was not and I don't know if you'd have any place for them to sleep considering all the spaces ridiculous team of security probably took up. Judge gamble didn't rule on whether or not mark could turn over Alex's phone data. She specifically said she wasn't going to get in the middle of that. Either way. It's not an invasion of his privacy because it was accidentally disclosed by Alex's lawyer and mark followed the proper channels before bringing it up. If Mark had gotten the text through clandestine means, then that would be a different story. But this was rain all fucking up. Yep. Also nothing about discovery, which Alex didn't even cooperate with violated Alex's Fourth Amendment rights. This is stupid. Alex's Fifth Amendment rights are fully intact, he was not compelled to testify against himself and he had all the due process and asshole can get. He had every opportunity to participate in the case, but chose not to civil and criminal courts cannot operate if people can just decide that they've made up their mind that they've been jammed up so they don't get they don't have to participate in the case. And any attempt to make them participate is actually the state railroading them. Sometimes it does happen that innocent parties get caught up in protracted processes defending themselves. And that sucks. But that's also why there are mechanisms in place to compensate people who have to go through that and why you can countersue if you need to. The Sixth Amendment doesn't apply since it's about criminal cases. And the Seventh Amendment only requires jury trials for civil cases in federal courts, and this is in the state court. And Barnes is saying that there are analogs in state court then why are you talking about the Constitution Dum Dums. Good call. Barnes is a lawyer he should know better and he does. He just doesn't care. He's not a lawyer. He's someone who knows law stuff and is happy to use that law stuff to justify right wing idiots on shows like this. And his own podcast with Viva fry. Small point, the guy who tried to storm that Ohio FBI office allegedly posted this on truth social, quote, I'm having trouble getting information but Viva Fry said Patriots are heading to Palm Beach where Mar a Lago is I recommend going and being Florida. I think the Feds won't break it up if they do kill them. If I were Barnes, I read and I really wanted to, like evoke an amendment for Alex, I would go with eight teeth. Now. Sure, that was repealed by the 21st Amendment. But if there was ever a right Alex could use right about now it's the prohibition of alcohol. See that?"

Obviously, yeah, this case absolutely did not include any supposition that questioning aspects of public events constitute a defamation. The reason that it might appear that way, if you're not paying attention is because the plaintiff's attorney has brought up a ton of instances of Alex repeating and defending talking points that he had used to argue that the shooting never happened long after he claims he stopped arguing that it didn't happen. In fact, Alex was repeating those claims in the middle of his post apology video. Imagine this scenario using one of Alex's bullshit claims from the Sandy Hook times which he got from how they confessor and continue to repeat long after supposedly realizing the shooting happened, right? Imagine you see online that people are claiming that the school wasn't even open and there was no internet traffic to the school's website in the year before the shooting, you would be totally free to discuss this claim that people were making online. And hopefully, you'd have the decency to take like five minutes to look into it and see that it's bullshit before going on air in mindlessly repeating the claim. But even so, if you repeat it as a question that folks have, you aren't committing defamation. This isn't what Alex did. He used these alleged anomalies as a pile of evidence that he would drop on the audience to support his claim that the shooting didn't happen when the plaintiff's attorneys would demonstrate that he was still making these claims in the fairly recent past, what they're doing is illustrating that he's still making the same arguments to deconstruct this a little bit. Alex was making the argument, if the school's website got no traffic, then the school wasn't open. If the school wasn't open the school, the shooting could not have happened, therefore the shooting didn't happen. It's essentially a setup of if A then B if B then C, A therefore C. It's a perfectly fine construction for an argument and it's called a hypothetical syllogism. And assuming all your premises are correct, it follows that your conclusion will be as well. When Alex has made the argument repeatedly on the show, the audience understands that A is proof of see whether or not they understand this logic path. So when Alex is claiming he believes the shooting happened, but then still insisting that premise A is correct, what he's doing is still affirming the conclusion while pretending that he's not. This is one of the ways that Alex has his cake and eat it too. Or as Mark said it in the trial. He wants it all ways. If you pay attention to his show, you'll see a bit of this behavior. And in the case of Sandy Hook, you can plug in a bunch of different narratives. In that place for premise a and it works the same. Paramedics weren't allowed in the building kids walked around in circles. FBI crime stats say no murders happened to Newtown that year. All of these things are the first premise is for that hypothetical syllogism structure. Barnes understands this, and on some level, Alex does too. But even leaving that aside, Alex's actions as it relates to Sandy Hook are so much worse than just making claims publicly. His promotion of Wolfgang Halbig, after the point where he could be reasonably expected to know that Wolfgang was harassing victims, family members, including Scarlet Lewis, is something that you might notice Barnes doesn't even touch. The defensive. Alex is grandstanding. And that grandstanding only works if you have a straw man version of the accusation that you need to defend yourself against? And Barnes knows all this. He's He's a total shithead. Yeah,"

When there's a statement like marks which can be translated as a direct attack on Alex, Alex can repackage that as an attack on the audience, which will allow him to more easily fleece, some of them into continuing to throw money into the pit that is Infowars. Alex is laughing because he feels that Mark has made his job of raising money easier. But there's a larger reality that Alex is trying to distract away from, which is that no matter what he does, there's a sword of Damocles hanging over his head, all the posturing and fundraising isn't really gonna matter much to a bankruptcy audit. And when you step into that arena, it's not a civil matter. If you try to play games, you could end up going to jail for the sort of crimes you end up pulling there. Yeah. And you have to consider what could come with a very clear cases of perjury that Alex was caught committing in the course of the trial. I don't know any of the specifics, but I wouldn't be surprised if that was something that could lead to huge fines or possibly even be referred for prosecution. Alex could do this song and dance with barns all they want, and it's fun for him to pretend that he's won this trial. But in order to do that, he has to pretend to hold tranche of other problems don't exist and aren't nipping at his heels. Like this is it's a grim picture."
