Yeah, you can play whatever he wants. Sure. And, you know, you know what he wants to play? Right. So here's what was said in between the clips that was cut out, quote, but there's no question that the Republican party today is dominated, driven and intimidated by Donald Trump and the mogga Republicans and that this is a threat to this country. These are hard things, but I'm an American president, not the president of red America or blue America but of all America. And I believe it is my duty, my duty to level with you to tell you the truth, no matter how difficult no matter how painful. It may be a coincidence that this was cut out. But it also seems like a point Alex wouldn't be super comfortable with particularly the part about the GOP being intimidated by Trump and his followers. Yeah, the impression about Trump and the Maga folks is supposed to be that they're winning the battle of ideas, and that they're just smarter and more patriotic than the rest of us, which is why they've taken over the GOP, it's not a great idea to plant seeds in the audience's mind that maybe they're a part of something hostile that is gained power not by being ideologically better. But by being more willing to threaten and employ violence. Alex also cuts out the part of the beginning where Biden says, quote, We must never forget, we the people are the true heirs of the American experiment that began more than two centuries ago. We the People have a burning inside each of us the flame of liberty that was lit here at Independence Hall of flame that lit our way through abolition, the Civil War suffrage, the Great Depression, World Wars, civil rights, that sacred flame still burns now, in our time as we build an America that is more prosperous, free, and just that is the work of my presidency, a mission I believe in with my whole soul. That's just good business on Alex's part, cutting that out. Yeah, he has a vested interest in pretending that his political enemies hate the country and what it stands for. So it's best not to allow someone like Biden to speak like this on Infowars as someone who has a passionate love for the country. Yeah, it would be too confusing to the audience really"

I think Alex knows well enough that most of his audience does see January 6 writers as patriots, which is uncomfortable. Yeah, it's hard for it's hard to rationalize. If you really have to confront it on it. Yeah, yeah. This is holding up a mirror to his audience his beliefs in a way that could be threatening whereas other parts of the speech that are left in they really aren't. For instance, he leaves in Biden saying quote, they promote authoritarian leaders because the audience doesn't think they do that. Trump DeSantis Bolsonaro and or bam, they're the furthest things from authoritarian in the audience's eyes. So hearing Biden say that is just absurd to them. That's not that's not something that's like taken aback by this. Yeah. Another part that Alex leaves in its quote mogga forces are determined to take this country backwards backward to an America where there is no right to choose no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love, all that stuff, the stuff that his audience believes in and is totally fine with."

This is not threatening for Alex to show the audience because it gives the audience the feeling that Biden is declaring war on them for their political beliefs. They I identify with the people that Biden is describing as a threat to democracy, which is what Alex wants them to feel. And the case of the January 6, thing that's a little bit different. That's a case where the audience will see their feelings mirrored by what Biden is saying, but it's not about political positions, they can justify his rational opposition to abortion, or believing that marriage is just between a man and a woman are things that are common in many religious communities. So it wouldn't give you pause to look at yourself in that mirror. The riots of January 6 were actions and those actions are way harder for people who want to see themselves as respectable to justify that's a mirror it's best not to look into partially because what Biden is saying makes sense. Yeah. The group that tried to overrun the capitol in order to stop the last election for being certified poses a threat to our democratic processes. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, you don't want to look at that mirror. Alex has also cut this part out, quote, but Well, the threat to American democracy is real. I want to say as clearly as we can, we are not powerless in the face of these threats. We are not bystanders in this ongoing attack on democracy. There are far more Americans far more Americans from every from every background and belief who reject the extreme mogga ideology than those who accept it. After that line, there was a big cheer, this could be useful to instill fear in the audience. But that doesn't play as well with the Infowars version of Biden and these ideas. Yeah, a huge part of the election conspiracy is that Biden was so unpopular, and then no one would come to his rallies. So you don't really want these large applause breaks. And the getting applause for the idea that there are more people who share sick of this stuff, share, share share, than Alex's goofy audience not good. That's not good. Now, there's a bunch more that's cut out and a lot of it is Biden saying things about uniting around defending our political process, and then getting applause, right? No need for stuff like that.

And Biden says, quote, notwithstanding those folks, you hear on the other side there, they're entitled to be outrageous. This is a democracy, but history and common sense, good manners is nothing they've suffered from. That's a pretty far cry from all those times Trump interrupted his own speeches to demand protesters be kicked out or times he responded with GLEDE protesters being assaulted at his rallies.

Because he knows that his followers are primed to hear something like this as the go ahead to start shooting or carrying out violence against the government. He desperately needs to create the preemptive narrative that anything that may happen is not real, and will be a false flag completely fake. Incidentally, when Biden said the public figures were calling for violence and when people were talking about that they weren't talking about Alex. This was almost certainly in response to Senator Lindsey Graham going on Fox News and saying that if Trump was charged for having all that classified Shadid Mar a Lago, then there would be riots in the streets. Nothing is not always about Alex. No, everything is always I mean, you except for to him, you could argue that most things are not about Alex typically, especially when Alec says they're about him.

He yells about free speech all day but wants to live in a country where athletes aren't allowed to take a knee during the national anthem in protest of racial discrimination in policing. These are things that Alex conceptualizes as the spear is being used to poke the metaphorical bowl and it really just sounds to me like Alex is expressing a profoundly white identity view of the country. He doesn't believe that people who are not straight white Christians are entitled to rights or power in this country.

That's a spear immigrants being allowed into the country. Instead of having a hardened militarized border. They're killed for crossing that's a spear. Here's the thing. When a bowl charges after being poked by a bunch of spears, it's a natural reaction. The matador waving that flag is something of the bowl can't really be faulted for charging. It's the expected result of all the poking. If we understand Alex's metaphor, his Patriot buddies are the bowl and there they would be well within their right to charge the matador in this case bomb things because they've been poked so much, right. The only problem is that the matadors Cape has the FBI behind it. That doesn't really make sense, because in the metaphorical Matador situation, there's a whole thing. There's really no way to make it a false flag. You would need like a fake bowl or some shit. And I have no idea how this works inside this construction. Yeah, this isn't Alex warning about a false flag. This is him warning his buddies about following their instincts. He's trying to tell the bull not to charge because it's a trap. Because Alex understand that his buddies want to charge that Matador really badly. They want to bomb shit. And Alex is smart enough to recognize that the way that people are talking about Biden speech is exactly the kind of thing that will lead. That will be as much of a stimulus for that as a matador waving okay, this isn't a false flag situation he's talking about. It's more of a honeypot kind of idea."

They don't have a good handle on that internal enemy, that is aggression and begging for someone to give them a reason to act on it pretty much understood appropriately. This episode has basically been Alex tripping over himself to frame Biden's speech in a way that inflames that aggression in his audience, but pays lip service to not wanting any violence so he can evade any accusations that he's causing and calling for terrorist acts. Right? Put simply, I don't respect anybody who accepts a booking on Infowars. But this guy is coming at the conversation of Biden speech from a completely different perspective than Alex. And I think that their views are actually at odds with each other. Oh, yeah, I disagree with the professor's point, mostly because if taken to its logical conclusion, you end up in a place where criticizing any potentially violent segment of the population is bad, because it will trigger their aggression.
