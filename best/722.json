At height, but sub relativistic speed. We did not go interdimensional we did not use the ship's FTL drive to get to Mars that would have been a waste of energy. This was a fusion pulse driven spacecraft. We were able to get to Mars in about four weeks. It was a boring trip. This was not like the Starship Enterprise.

So Venus is different from Mars because you had go there and you're dealing with, you know, a planet that was colonized by the other side of the Iron Curtain. So there's, there's you know it Soviet colonialism, if you want to call it that, it's debatable whether you can call it a colonialism, but their their foreign policy was fundamentally different from The theory behind US foreign policy, I actually disagree with the term Soviet empire. I think Empire is a misnomer. There were certainly problematic aspects of their foreign policy.
