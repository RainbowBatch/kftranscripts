And I didn't even like that. So I gotta make television so much. And now it's good to the point where I can't watch it. I mean, it was becoming that upsetting when we talked about the Fraser episode where he joins the gun club, and his family. His friends all criticized him and what's wrong with him? This is crazy. This is evil. No, it's not bad. And he could do anything else. But this was bad. And then at the end, he goes into the basement and there's the gun club huddled around something whispering he says watch that they don't show it is that they say oh, it's it's a machine we're building to defeat the New World Order. And he screams in horror season runs out what it is, but the message is, there's the secret groups, they're armed by own guns. That's a sign of being a terrorist. They want to bring down the government. And Frazier was criticized by his whole family. And it turns out he was right. See, he fled out of the building. And you know, anybody that's in the guns and talks about a new world order is dangerous. And you better run screaming from him. I mean, I couldn't watch a movie.

He has really basic plot points wrong like how it was Niles, not Fraser who got into guns, or more importantly, that it wasn't a gun club. It was that Niles and his dad went to a shooting range. The bigger aspect that Alex is really missing with this episode is that the shooting range and guns are treated as totally normal, safe and actually fun. Fraser's dad has a routine of going shooting and Niles is a stick in the mud. But after firing a gun, he realizes that it's really enjoyable and not that scary. Nothing about guns or even an issue that the episode makes look bad. It's the people that he met at the shooting range that are a weirdo New World Order dudes. And that wouldn't have even really been a problem except they were trying to get nails to come to their compound in Idaho, which is why Frazier's dad was worried in the first place.

If Alex actually thinks that level four labs are for weaponized things that explains a lot of his dumb ideas, but he's just making that up. The distinction between level three and four are the things that are studied in level four labs are, quote, infectious agents or toxins that pose a high risk of aerosol transmitted laboratory infections and life threatening diseases for which no vaccine or therapy is available. Both use very high levels of safety protocols, but understandably, for things that are, you know, studied and level four, they need greater control, right?

The government is basically God. This was one of Hitler's most My favorite things to promote and say, it's taken totally out of context. The new Bibles are being edited and changed and altered in amazing ways. And so even if you're not a Christian, this is very interesting because it's kind of that Orwellian memory hole where history is being altered all around us and in front of us. And I heard Mr. Revere yesterday on the air with with John Anderson, who is on the network. I know a lot of people don't agree with him some do. I'm not getting off into a debate about eschatology versus other interpretations of the Bible. But I do agree with with Mr. Mr. Anderson, about his comment that a lot of the churches lie down and say, we're not supposed to be involved, because, you know, Jesus is gonna come back and do it all.

After circling the block, he realized that we were headed out of town toward the embassy. We were about three blocks ahead of him and he traveled at a high rate of speed to catch up with us. After leaving the city limits I turned on to the long driveway of our friend's place. Quinn also entered the private property and turned on his overhead lights. We stopped in front of the garage and Quinn pulled up behind us. I opened my door and started to exit the car. Quinn stepped out of his car and yelled for me to remain in the car. Rather than cause a scene I remained seated in the car and close the door. No, it's Quinn was talking on the radio. I asked Rachel How to handle the situation. She had no answer. We both realized that it had been five years since being stopped and I was pretty rusty. Two unmarked cars arrived within moments. One of the persons in the first car was the chief of police quit and approached this my side of the car and stood slightly behind me. He asked to see my driver's license and registration. I asked if he was tape recording, and he said he was not. Rather than answer his question I stated, I am an ambassador of Jesus Christ with the kingdom of heaven.
