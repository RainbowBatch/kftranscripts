The first is that they have the capability and capacity to do it from a technological standpoint. The second is that they would lose essentially nothing given that their oil companies are sanctioned. And these pipelines are all but shut down currently. The third is that this kind of gesture would send a strong message to the whole of Europe that they're not going to be getting Russia oil in the future. And that even if the war ends, they're at the mercy of Russia's energy supplies. This is in line with acts that Russia has carried out in the past using energy as a tool to apply pressure on Europe to sway policy. In the immediate this isn't going to make things that much worse at all. For Europe, in terms of energy supplies, Nord Stream two was never open. So it doesn't really factor into things. And Russia cut off Nord Stream one over the course of the war in Ukraine. This is more of an omen than anything else. And there are very few parties, you could imagine having a reason to do this, other than Russia, right? It is possible that this is the result of a wild coincidence, or even a rogue actor that we haven't identified could be behind it. But the smart money is pretty clear."

What's happened is that there's a brand of chips and snacks called circle harvest, and they use cricket protein in their chips. It's very prominently displayed on the packaging with the name of the product being cricket corn chips, so I don't know if anybody's being tricked into anything here. Circle harvest has been holding presentations at schools since 2007 about their insect protein business and their insect farming, which weirdly is only now becoming an issue for Alex and all these other idiots on the right. This year they began selling their corn chips as an option in about 1000 Australian schools at the canteen. So if kids want to eat them, they can. They don't have to.

That's what the prior is a food source that's not toxic. But the latter is a cosmological treatment that uses a cream containing formaldehyde, which can be toxic to people or cause negative reactions, right? It's not the keratin itself that's toxic. It's the formaldehyde cream that's being used to treat human keratin like a person's hair. Yeah, there's been a lot of misinformation flying around about chitin. The polysaccharide found in bug exoskeletons mostly about how it's undigestible by humans and toxic, it's not toxic. But it is true that chitin itself may not be fully digestible. But so cellulose, which doesn't stop people from eating celery, you can still get nutritional value out of eating something that contains parts that can't be fully digested, and then you just pass those parts. It's actually good for you like how people need fiber to stay regular."

The actual study that's behind this is titled quote associations of BMI with COVID 19 vaccine uptake vaccine effectiveness and risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes after vaccination in England, a population based cohort study, if you understand the title, you'll probably realize that this study would never be able to be used to make the kind of claims Alex's reporting, it's just not something that you're looking at lead stories reached out to the study's co author, and they explained that this interpretation of their data is irresponsible and incorrect. There's one data box in the study that's being used to argue that vaccines cause a 44% increased risk of infection. And if you only look at the numbers in isolation and create your own interpretation, you could maybe come away with that conclusion. But it's totally out of context and wrong. This was an observational study, which is to say it depends entirely on tests that have already been taken. As explained by lead stories, quote, their data was dependent on COVID tests that were available to them and the people who chose to take them. In other words, a person who didn't feel sick and didn't take a test wouldn't be able to provide with them with a negative test result. So the data is highly skewed. Yeah, that is an issue. As we see, every day, Alex has a new COVID vaccine narrative that's full of shit and easily dismissed with a tiny bit of digging. He never looks for any explanation or context because he doesn't want it that would ruin his ability to keep throwing out these vaccine narratives of the day which he needs to keep his audience in a focused scared state. Yeah, constantly seeing new flashy headlines scroll past them, that will be forgotten tomorrow and the next day there'll be something new."

And it even has the same tweets put out on the same days that we actually put out in the real world in 2000 to 2001. And it goes into 2003. They just changed the acronyms in the tweets in agencies. So they would have a battle plan of what to say and what to do in real time. And so they got caught with the battle plan, it wouldn't be a plan for a biological attack on America through the virus and then through the vaccine. It would just be a drill emergency Saturday broadcast world shocked by spars 2025 2028 document. And I'm gonna have that reposted to Infowars dot com front page under the live show feed today.

And then how about six months, then it would start coming out that it actually would give you the disease that describe a COVID like disease, respiratory disease out of China. And then then describe about a year into it, they would start having people from the health services defecting saying it was wrong to do. And then within two years of releasing the deadly vaccine, they would then admit that it was lab grown and they would then admit that it didn't work. And that they would remove the heads of Big Pharma there'd be a bunch of punishment. But that there would then be a biomedical state brought in to basically oversee all a big pharma, which is what Big Pharma wants is to be merged in with the United Nations and the World Economic Forum.

The document doesn't say any of that stuff, but these are the narratives that have gained prominence in Alex's world so they're the things that he needs to retro actively apply to this scenario exercise or else it doesn't really have that much use for him. spars much Like lockstep isn't actually useful for Alex, if you read them and understand what they are, they only have utility as ideas, skeletons that he can build a body onto himself. It's one of the reasons that scenario exercises as a whole are super popular among conspiracy theorists like Alex, they portray imagined future events, they explain the scenario using narratives. These are things that Alex can exploit, he can take the actual document and lie about the imagined future events and how they line up with current real events. He can write his own narrative to replace the one that actually exists in the document pretty safe in the knowledge that if anyone called him out about it, it's just a matter of storytelling to convince them that his narrative is secretly what the document is actually about. But it's all lies. None of this is real. And it doesn't even match past versions of the spars, document conspiracy, Alex's spread. This is all just meaningless shit, whose end result is really just getting people hurt, I guess."

That is the way he describes the theories that he just started to look at. Yeah, he was just looking at the suspicions that people had when he uses that kind of language. He is definitely whether or not he actually believes anything. Yeah, he is definitely giving voice to the this was all fake. Yeah. thing. He said it again. This is and I think if I had to guess it's, it's based in anger. Like, yeah, I went Mark. Bankston was first on the show. First time, he speculated that one of the things that drove Alex is anger at these parents. Yeah. And I didn't really necessarily agree. I thought it was an interesting perspective. But it wasn't the way I necessarily looked at it. Right. Right. I'm coming more along to that. Yeah.

It's a joint venture operated by the Danish company Energinet and the Polish oil company Gaz-System.

As far back as the beginning of the year, they were estimating October 1 as their partial opening date with the full capacity possible by the beginning of 2023. Right. It's maybe interesting that this pipeline opened around the same time as those other ones were possibly sabotaged. But that alone is not enough to prove that these events are connected. Yeah.

So giving you archetypes of this and so Renfields are your corrupt CPS workers, Renfields, your corrupt family court judges, Renfields are the people in Germany in the US at the orphanages that deliver children to the pedophile rings. And there's different levels of Renfield, low level Renfield system, groom and deliver children, then you'll have Renfields that keep children ready and trained. And they're trying to transition as Renfield is in the book Dracula to being a full vampire. And so they actually rape children they hurt children, and they're always begging Dracula can we can I take part in killing him? And then Dracula slaps him down, because you've got to really work hard and beg to get to the point where actually slicing up children drinking their blood.

A member of the greens parliamentary group recently said quote by the end of 2026, a third of all newly advertised positions in the city should be filled by applicants with a migration background. This is a headline that Alex is reading from summit dot news. Paul Joseph Watson sight and just on its face, the way this is being reported is convoluted. Here's how the article starts, quote, In the name of promoting diversity ruling greens in the German in the German city of Hanover plan to ban a third of native citizens from applying for government jobs so they can be given to migrants. Yes, really? Wow. How is a third of city jobs ideally being filled by non German born citizens the equivalent of banning a third of native citizens from applying for those jobs. That's just nonsense. Unless Paul somehow believes that the only jobs available in Hanover are from the city. Paul reports it this way because it's a much more flashy headline then city aims for 30% immigrant workforce. Paul's version is easier for Alex to yell about and get his audience nice and scared with. That's why he writes the completely nonsensical and dishonest title that he does. It's because Paul's role is to churn out rage bait, the demagogues like Alex can then use to incite their audiences. Here's the part of the story that Paul doesn't want to bring up and neither does Alex Hanover's population is only 78%, German born aiming for a city workforce of approximately 30%, non German born individuals is really not too far off from accurately reflecting the city's demographic makeup. Considering that the 30% that they're talking about is a goal, not a mandate, it's likely that they'll fall short of that number. And maybe, maybe they'll hit 22% immigrant hires, which would be exactly representational of the city as a whole. Yeah, this is outrage based on nothing. And it's actually based on less than nothing. It's based on a willful ignorance of basic reality, because that reality would get in the way of being able to agitate against groups of people you don't like, and you want your audience not to, like, pure and simple."

He claimed that he was in combat in Afghanistan, but there are no records of that. And his claim that his deployment was classified has been questioned by experts. Even if it were classified what he was doing, there's still ways he could corroborate that deployment, which he has failed to do. Also, it turns out he was dishonest about why he couldn't reenlist after his first stretch in the Air Force. He apparently was stationed at a base in Okinawa and got popped for drunk driving mere days before 9/11 Which led to him being demoted from Airman First Class to basic airman. This mess has resulted in the GOP not being really hot on him anymore. As you know, the stabs from the Republicans. Yeah, but it's good to see that he says the birchers behind him. He's running against Marcy Kaptur, who's been in office since 1983. So I don't know if I'm gonna put too much money on Jr. here. The district though, was widely reshaped in 2020, which led to a much higher GOP voting percentage, but it might not be enough. I'm not entirely sure. You know, it went from a heavily pro Democrat district. Yeah. In the cook partisan index, right. A slightly Republican one. So it's, it's it's a toss up. So yeah.
