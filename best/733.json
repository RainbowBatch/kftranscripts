There's a kernel of truth to the story that Alex was telling about the US government buying a bunch of pills that treat radiation poisoning, but he's just way off. And he's telling the story wrong. This is about a recent $290 million purchase of a drug called Nplate. It's not potassium iodide, as Alex will go on to say and such. But Alex isn't really a details guy. So yeah, this is not the first time that the government administration for strategic preparedness and response has purchased such medication. But it is the first time with Nplate mostly because he was only approved for this purpose in 2021. This is the end result of financing that the HHS began in 2019 on this drug, and it serves a purpose in the Strategic National Stockpile. But it apparently isn't that great of a drug to respond to nuclear attacks, predominantly because it needs to be used fairly quickly after exposure to be effective. Right. So if like a city was nuked, this wouldn't really be that useful. No, this is more like it would be too difficult,"

All it says is that it was quote, due to illness is a pretty broad category. That's a big one. The article quotes a Facebook post as saying that she had a brief illness, so it's probably not something that was chronic. And on her memorial page, there's a link where you can donate to a meningitis research organization. This doesn't mean that she contracted a severe case of meningitis. But that is a distinct possibility. Given these data points, you would think, anyway, there's no indication that this woman was vaccinated, nor that her passing had anything to do with a vaccination or a massive heart attack, right, as Alex is saying, but that doesn't matter for Alex. For him, every dead young person is a perfect prop to use as proof of his conspiracies. And this has the effect of encouraging harassment of people who knew these tragically, deceased youths. The entire narrative is dumb, baseless, and has the potential to hurt people. So it's right up Alex's alley, mostly because it's easy, and it allows him to make shit up instead of doing any work,"

It's more of like a the generals mishandled operations kind of critique and criticism. Yeah, it's pretty wild for people to be doing that since Putin's government passed a law back in March where they could imprison people for up to 15 years for criticizing the military. The only person in that article that Alex is citing who is calling for nuclear weapons to be used is Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who's a hardline Putin loyalist. He's such a Putin loyalists that he's trying to scapegoat the some other people in the Kremlin to defend Putin from criticisms about how things are going in Ukraine. Yeah, another small point, the headline of the article that Alex is using as quote, Russian elite voice growing anger as losses mount in Ukraine, Alex added, demanding Putin do more from his own imagination. Yeah, that is not in the text nor the article. I don't know who would end up in power if Putin were removed, mostly because almost all relevant political opposition in the country has been crushed or imprisoned. And Putin has essentially been in power for 22 years. So it's hard to predict who would descend? Yeah, no matter who it would be. It does not matter. It does not mean that like Putin is not a moderate. Who would come to power not leave that aside. Yeah. ridiculous to say Putin to moderate No, that's just another rationalization for Alex to use to justify his very obvious support for Putin, despite a bunch of stuff happening in the world that makes that support look really bad, right?"

There's no question about following Kissinger's advice because you and Kissinger both work for the devil, and Kissinger is about as high level as it gets for humans on the demon scale.

Second, he claims that he's just gonna take calls but that's bullshit. Alex can't stay on task to save his life. So this is going to end up being more rants and begging people for money at the beginning of this show. He said the first and second hours open phones. He gets two calls an hour and 20 minutes into the show. So close. So close. And you know, this is there's a third point to this. And this seems desperate. Yeah, there's no reason to do this show other than to try to make more money. There's no great demand for it. There's no way Alex needs more time to cover the news. What this boils down to is that no one else at Infowars can sell for shit. Oh, and and Harrison's shows clearly aren't bringing in the sales. So Alex feels like he needs to be on air essentially all the time to keep the infomercial going. If that weren't a major factor in this idea, he could easily have someone else host a show. That's mostly callers. Oh, wait, that was the premise of Harrison Smith show before he started getting a bunch of callers that were like, Hey, why won't Alex just say it to the Jew?"

You can see here how much of a charge Alex gets out of negative attention. That's just such a powerful fuel for him because he's internalized the fallacious idea that consequences and negative attention are the signs of a virtuous person. He's up against this cosmic overpowered evil. So the fact that Alex is facing a giant defamation judgment can only be evidence of how good he is. If he were an evil person, that cosmic overpowered evil forces would protect him from such a thing. But because he's a threat to the devil, he's subjected to the slings and arrows, Shakespeare nice. This is a really dangerous and stupid mindset to have. Because if you think this way, and you're like, I don't know, let's say you're a narcissist, you'll never be able to accept any criticism. Every time someone tells you that you fucked up every time that you get in trouble for something really bad that you did, you'll find a way to convince yourself that the consequences or criticism is just motivated by evil trying to get you off course from your holy mission. Your ability to self assess is completely erased by this mindset replaced by an ability to rationalize any really hurtful or destructive things you do. Alex is afraid to wrestle with the actual impact that he has on the world because on some level, probably or even pilot, possibly subconscious. He knows that that would be the end of his career. His ideology and worldview don't hold up to any actual scrutiny. So his ability to hide behind being a champion for that ideology and worldview would likewise crumble if examined critically, if all consequences are just proof that you're on the right track, then whoever may have been hurt along the way, they're just the unfortunate collateral damage of the war against the globalists. But if these consequences aren't proof that you're on the right track, and they're just people you've hurt, there's no excuse for it. You just don't care how many people's lives you ruined in order to make sure that you're rich and sound interesting on your radio show. That's really the sort of real world version of this."
