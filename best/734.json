And it shows Newtonian physics is again being proven accurate for every action, there's an opposite and equal reaction, or opposite and equal reaction. So let me start getting into the good news first. Pay Pal came out on Friday in their terms of service officially. And said if we don't like what you say or what you believe we will fine you $2,500 per infraction. There was a gigantic backlash and they revoked it and said, We're sorry. We're not going to do it. You mean for now? They've gotten away with so much for so long. I told you next is debanking. Next is a universal basic income and the social credit score and total control, when they snap their fingers and say jump. You say yes sir master how high."

Pay Pal has certain rules about what their service cannot be used for. For instance, you can't use it to pay assassins or sell drugs. In a version of their acceptable use policy they included on their list of prohibited uses things that quote are fraudulent, promote misinformation or are harmful. This language was subsequently removed from the policy statement, which I guess Alex is taking credit for. great. They never were going to find you $2,500 for spreading misinformation. This is a misreporting of their policy that relates to PayPal's ability to charge you $2,500 If you're sued for doing any of the prohibited activities, when using their service. right, This is essentially a flat rate per violation that they assess to protect themselves and recoup expenses that may come from you using PayPal to do things that they explicitly say you can't. Sure, sure. Anyway, the story is more useful to Alex the way he tells it. But ironically, that's Alex spreading misinformation, which luckily won't get him fined by PayPal and wouldn't have before either, because this is a full of shit narrative."

This is a disgusting mentality that Alex is espousing, masquerading as a message of empowerment. Also to touch on that point that he makes about corporations teaching you to comply with criminals like robbers, that's really important and good advice. I've worked at a couple of gas stations in my life and I was even robbed at gunpoint once at one of them. If you work in a setting like this, you will have your bosses tell you that if someone wants to rob you, go along with everything they're saying, unless they want you to leave the store, then it becomes a completely different crime and if you're looking at being kidnapped, you shouldn't comply. We never go to a second location, but in the overwhelming majority of cases the person robbing you doesn't want to hurt you. They just want money which is replaceable and the store is likely insured anyway. There's literally no point in fighting back and risking escalation to situation into one way where people get hurt or even killed. Yeah, the same is true in a lot of stores. Like for instance, I worked at an Office Depot. And they very clearly told us that if the alarm goes off that someone left without paying for something, don't chase them, just let them go, why, There are cameras up. And again, the stolen item is just a stolen item, you don't have to risk your well being over it. In reality, there's an issue here where your employer doesn't want to get sued by your family if you're killed on the job and taking a hit of whatever the robber gets away with from the tail is small potatoes. Yeah, but whatever the motivation, it's very weird that these bosses and corporations seem to care a lot more about your well being than Alex"

Florida will not be silent on the truth. The diet, the guidance recommends the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines for males 18 to 39 years old, not be given, in a statement The doctor has said that the studying of the safety, the efficacy of any medication, including vaccines to an important component, public health, far less attention has been paid to safety and the concerns of many individuals who've had been dismissed. These are important findings that should be communicated to Floridians. Well, that's to say the least. The Florida Department of Health released the findings of a self control their own study K series, which they use to evaluate the safety of COVID vaccines were studied mortality risk following mRNA COVID-19 vaccinations. So the state itself sign up a bunch of people, didn't tell him what the study was. Had them take the shot because they were wanting it, to see what would happen. That's what he's been doing in the last year since Governor DeSantis brought him in and said he's given full faith in him."

Sure, we need a theme song. Yeah, I don't think we do. This unsurprisingly, is bullshit. The Florida Surgeon General did say this. And this is a real press release. But the underlying study itself has some critical flaws with how it's designed, to the point where one begins to question if it was a study seeking a particular conclusion, as opposed to one looking to determine truth. While the data in the study does show an 84% increase in cardiac related deaths in people who got mRNA vaccines, but there's some gigantic red flags that should make you never rely on this study to report that data. The first is that the paper has no authors listed, which is really suspicious. No one's name is on there."

Third, and perhaps most troublingly, the paper just used death certificates to define deaths. Thus, deaths with a code of 130 through 152, which covers quote, other forms of heart disease, are included. This section of codes does include cardiac arrest, but the section doesn't cover a number of other heart related outcomes that didn't make sense for them to exclude, that, it skews the data a bit right. Also, someone who has cardiac arrest on their death certificate may have died from something else that led to their heart stopping. It's not precise enough to be helpful in this context at all for what they're trying to assert, right. Fourth, the paper has some issues with who they included and did not include. They claim that they include excluded anyone who has been diagnosed with COVID. But in the limitation section, they say this, quote, this study cannot determine the causative nature of a participants death, we use death certificate data and not medical records. COVID testing status was unknown for those who did not die of or with COVID. This makes things very confusing. They had no knowledge of the testing status of anyone who didn't die of or with COVID. But people who died over with COVID were excluded from the study, which would seem to indicate that they had no idea of any of the people in the study had COVID at any point,"

They tried to intimidate and bum rush and panic and bully everyone into submission. But it didn't work. Some took it but the victory we've had now is massive. People are really waking up.

It's stale, repetitive, and you're really preaching to the choir, the audience already thinks the vaccine's a death shot. So proving that over and over again is just monotonous. However, with Alex Lee Moyer's dumb movie, and Glenn Greenwald's glowing review and the mileage that he's been able to get out of things like that Channel Five interview, and his book release, and the attention that he's getting from the trial, I wouldn't be surprised if Alex was seeing some new eyes on his product. And some of these folks probably got vaccinated. If you have a new initiate, and you make them scared of this death vaccine, that's killing millions that they've already taken, and there's no solution, it's gonna be hard to make money off them. Conversely, if you start to come up with cures and solutions to protect yourself, if you've been vaccinated, then you can create this intense fear about the vaccine and then sell people a placebo to alleviate those fears."

But I also think that there's a line, I still can feel for people who are acting out in manic outbursts, but when they're things that they're saying or doing are destructive, and they've had multiple opportunities to get help and have the resources to do so. The primary concern that I have shifts from their well being to the damage that their actions can have on others. Kanye is well past that line. But it isn't really too often that he comes up in our travels because Alex has a dicey history with Kanye. When he was first doing his I like Trump thing and hanging out with Candace Owens. Alex had Owens on the show as a guest from time to time and I think that Alex thought Kanye was gonna come on, and that never happened. But Kanye wore a maga hat. So Alex liked him right? And everything was well sure. Then in July 2020, Alex got mad at him because Kanye did an interview the publicly announced his split from Trump, which wasn't cool. So close to the election, particularly right. And like that Kanye was once again evil, which in Alex's world really just translates to someone I can't use to make a buck, right? But now Kanye is doing attention grabbing nonsense in public again and talking to Tucker about it. So it's a pretty safe bet that Alex is back to thinking that Kanye is pretty all right after all, yeah. For those who haven't been following the current timeline, here's a quick breakdown of what's happened. Kanye and Candace Owens were at a fashion show in Paris where they showed off Kanye's new T shirt that just said white lives matter. This was stupid on a number of levels. Obviously, the intention was to shock but if anyone was shocked by this, it was a shock without depth. There's no art to it. It's a banal, kind of shocking, lazy, shocking, if shocking at all."

And that's pretty much what happened. Yep. Kanye is now embattled by the woke mob according to outlets like Fox because he dared to wear this shirt is a brave and artistic statement. I'm not sure if this is true, or if any woke mobs are embattling him. I kind of think that most people's response to his thought was along the lines of oh, this is happening again. wearing a white lives matter shirt while hanging out with Candace Owens is going to be viewed as racist type behavior by some but at this point, we're four years past the point where he did an interview and said that slavery was a choice. Kanye did get some negative feedback from his shirt coming from P Diddy of all people. The man who enters through the Diddy door texted Kanye, which we know we know about because Kanye posted a picture of the texts on Instagram. Kanye apparently wrote Diddy saying quote, I didn't like our Convo. I'm selling these Ts. Nobody can get in between me and my money. never called me with no bullshit like that again, unless you're ready to greenlight me because anybody that got on that T is me. This brings up an important point and that is that Kanye is selling these shirts so at its core This is basically just a publicity stunt. Yeah, Diddy asks for an address to meet with Kanye because his actions are causing distress. Kanye responds quote, This ain't a game. I'm gonna use you to show the Jewish people that told you to call me that no one can threaten or influence me. I told you this is war. Not great. Okay. Rightly people were pretty offended by this and his Instagram account ended up getting the boot. So he went to Twitter and posted quote, I'm a bit sleepy tonight but when I wake up, I'm going DEATH CON three on all caps Jewish people. Wow. The funny thing is that I actually can't be anti semitic because black people are actually Jew. Also, guys have toyed with me and tried to blackball anybody who opposes your agenda, right? He followed this with another tweet saying, quote, who you think created cancel culture. People really didn't enjoy this seeing as it's essentially swimming in anti semitic tropes. And this is really just a stone's throw away from Holocaust denial. Yeah. To recap, this was an episode that began with him wearing a racist trolling t shirt to a fashion show with racist troll Candace Owens, and ended up with him publicly declaring that he's going to war with the Jews. This is a mess."

It takes a certain level of scumbag to exploit somebody who's clearly unwell. And it turns out, Tucker is right at that level. You kind of expect that desperate grifters like Owens would take any opportunity to attach themselves to Kanye, regardless of the context because it gets their name in the media. Absolutely. Someone like Tucker, you kind of hoped that he'd realized that he doesn't always need to press like he's a big enough star and he's effective enough at pushing his talking points that interviewing Kanye is more of a liability than it is an opportunity. For instance, what if like a day or two after your interview your interview subject who you spent two days of your show arguing is sane and an insightful person declares that he's gone to war with the Jews. What then? Or even worse? What if it comes out that he said that kind of stuff in your interview, but you cut it out of the finished product to make it all more palatable for your audience? Hmm, what if footage of leaks that shows that you had every reason to suspect that your interview subject was unwell and also clearly expressing anti semitic views to your face? And then you just edit those things out? So you could exploit that celebrity to put his celebrity behind your political ideology? Yeah, seems like this is a risk you wouldn't want to take if you're Tucker"

And even so it felt meandering. It felt overly edited, but yet still not concise. What I'm saying is that I don't recommend it. It's kind of a dumb interview, particularly the part where Kanye complains about how the Democrats and the Clintons wanted to get to his wife so they could take advantage of Kanye's fame to push their messaging when he's sitting next to a guy who's doing exactly that just without his wife's involvement. yeah, at the end of day two of the interview series, Kanye briefly mentions Alex Jones.

But the fact that you're mad at the people less successful than you are concerned about your well being means you should probably put some meds in your head. I have a litany of thoughts about this interview.

And I've used the analogy a lot of everybody's walked in a, usually it's a department store but you're buying a mattress you're buying some pots and pans and like a table they'll have fruit and you just look at it for 20 feet away you have to fake fruit If you don't need to go pick it up, you can look at it. You just know it looks too good. It looks too bright. It just doesn't look right. You know what a real pear looks like? What a real apple looks like what a real orange looks like, you know, it's fake. You walk over it's plastic and pick it up. Yeah, that's fake. That's all Kanye's saying. And then it's coordinated.

From there. Alex has extrapolated this out into being an entirely fake Town Hall, which I guess is evidence that school shootings are faked. Now, if Alex wanted to really blow some minds with this conspiracy, the 15 year old girl at that town hall was named Brennan Leach. And if that name rings a bell, it's because she went on to be a Senate aide who was photographed transporting the electoral ballots on January 6. Some folks misreported that she and other aides were protecting these votes during the rioting, but in reality, it was a photo from the morning. Sure, this is perfect for Alex it proves the January 6 was a Clinton false flag and the planning has been going on since that town hall when this kid asked a staged question to Hillary, it's perfect."

I understand the short term gains that you can get from clout chasing here, but considering what Alex is saying, he should know what he's associating himself with. Alex is clearly running cover for Kanye's anti semitic Instagram post here by implying that the Tucker interview and the white lives matter shirt is the reason that he's kicked off the platform, instead of Kanye posting private messages between him and Diddy, where he threatens to use him as an example to the Jewish people who told Diddy to contact him. Alex knows what he's doing. Kanye is useful in terms of giving the appearance of not being racist while simultaneously using his celebrity to push dumb extreme right wing politics to a different audience. And Alex knows that comes with the byproduct of spreading intense anti semitic ideas to that wide audience and promoting them to your own audience at least tacitly, and Alex doesn't care at all. This is probably at least partially due to the fact that Alex's ideology is underpinned by pretty similar anti semitic ideas. Now, as for Candace Owens, Alex can claim that he woke her up but she's been very public about her experience moving to the right and it's due to GamerGate. In high school, Candace received a settlement of over $37,000 when she sued the school board for failing to protect her from racist death threats and harassment. Coincidentally, Norm Pattis, was her lawyer. In 2015 She started a website called degree 180, where there was a blog full of anti Trump and anti Republican content. So, now around that side. She followed this up in 2016 with a website called Social autopsy, which was supposed to be a site where online bullies would be unmasked and their anonymity was taken away. Everyone thought this was a terrible idea, and it would just lead to doxing and targeted harassment. It's super easy to see the way that the site's concept could be used for evil, particularly when it's being run by someone with as flimsy principles as Owens. Zoe Quinn, the target of a lot of the GamerGate harassment apparently sent Owens a message warning her that this wasn't a good idea, and she was likely to become the target of harassment herself if she followed through with this. Unsurprisingly, Owens did get, start getting harassed and doxxed and she decided to create an evidenceless conspiracy that Quinn wasn't warning her of the result of her terrible idea, she was actually threatening her that if she made this website Quinn would let loose a team of online harassers. Wow. And just like that Candace Owens became a right wing con artist. She took on the name Red Pill Black and then started working for Turning Point USA, which she continued to do until she made those comments back in 2018 about how Hitler would have been totally cool if he didn't have aspirations outside of Germany. So weird how these, there's a high percentage of people Alex claims to have woken up who go on to do Nazi shit. Yeah, yeah, that's not a coincidence."

We're going to take $2,500, outside of law, outside of courts, out of your account. Now the first thing I thought when I saw that once I got off here Friday because I missed it.

He doesn't understand the underlying story about PayPal and how this wasn't a fine, they were going to charge you it was related to fees that will be placed in your account if you're sued for crimes that involve the platform. Because Alex doesn't understand the underlying story here and just as a loose grip on the headline, he's read on like a right wing blog, he thinks that PayPal is going to find you $2,500 If you write a post on your blog that says that climate change isn't real. Now this introduces a problem. How is PayPal going to know that you're blogging about unapproved things so they can fine you. In order to accept the inaccurate and incorrect version of this story, there needs to be some mechanism in place for it to even work logistically. So Alex has written that part of the story for the audience, pulled straight from his imagination. Consider how stupid all of this is, if you believe Alex's version, PayPal would have needed to set up a super expensive part AI, part manual system to monitor all of its users behavior off site to see if they're doing anything that they could get them fined. That would require spying on like 400 million people, which would be really expensive, it'd be expensive to operate but the infrastructure to do it would also take millions upon millions of dollars to set up. So they sink all that money in, knowing that they're going to be able to recoup their losses with this fine system. You know, they're gonna start raking in that sense of censorship cash, but then oh, no, what's this? The right wing media is complaining about the terms of service. And just like that, years of investment and implementation of a worldwide censorship AI system has to be thrown out and the terms of service just go back to normal. This is legitimately what's implied by Alex's narrative. This is what you have to accept, whether you realize it or not, in order to take on Alex's version of the story, which is inaccurate because he didn't actually read the story or look into this at all, and he's just making shit up on the fly to freak out the listeners."

It was a good time, long after they banned Alex Jones, to come out and say, Listen, you dirty, filthy Americans. We're watching your ass. And if you do one thing we don't like, we're gonna fine you and kick you off our platform. What a group of criminals. But I'll tell you who is really pathetic. It's us. If we put up with crap like this and turn our world over to people like this. We deserve everything we've got.
