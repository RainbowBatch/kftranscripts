We're not scared and we're not going away. And we're not going to stop. And literally for hundreds of 1000s of dollars I can keep them in court for years. I can appeal this stuff.

You don't hook people on some sort of drug that is foreign to their body. You talk about things that are obvious to them and that no one else talks about. And until people begin to understand what makes a show like Infowars or Alex Jones or Owen Shroyer are popular, they're asking the wrong questions."

      "text": "I agree with Norm that this is a factor that's underappreciated in terms of understanding Infowars and misinformation in general, but his conclusion is childish. No one actually gravitates to Infowars or Alex because of his handle on information or the idea that he talks about stories no one else has the nerve to cover and I would say that there is a drug that he hooks his listeners on even ignoring the dumb placebo ass supplements that he sells at huge markups. And he sells to people by pretending that they have a deficiency that he can solve. yeah. Like you don't have iodine in you so you need it. yeah. Alex creates emotional hooks that get into people and they operate very similarly to how a drug might. The truth or falsity of things Alex says don't matter to the audience because he's eliciting a feeling that they believe is true. Some story about an immigrant murdering a white woman that Alex yells about may not actually be true, but the audience doesn't care because to them, the feeling he's promoting with that story that, you should be afraid of immigrants and that they want to kill white women, is true. That's the majority of what Alex has got in his skill, set evoking feelings, and it's pretty easy to see why his show is successful while Owen and Harrison are just pathetic also rans. They can't stir emotions like Alex can. Owen's just doing a bad Alex impression most of the time and doesn't come off as sincere at all. And Harrison's just too clearly a whiny baby dweeb. They can get a little bit of traction but they can't come anywhere near to even being like Alex's second because they can't do this. That's why PJW sucks on Alex's show, but he's really successful on YouTube. in that format with the quick cuts and the weird close ups on his face looking very emotional, Paul is able to make the audience feel things. Even David Knight had a bit of this, which is why part a part of why it was so dumb for Alex to fire him. To you or I David Knight was a painfully boring snooze but his rhetorical style was good at reaching the older demographics, who really don't care for Alex's theatricality and yelling, he could elicit feelings in the older crowd."

And if Alex lets himself fly a little too freely, it feels like that could haunt him, particularly because that case is one where he is super guilty and the damages could end up being way higher than the Lewis Heslin one. Alex is trapped in a space between being essentially impotent to change reality, and needing to appear defiant to the audience or risk the cash drying up. If what Norm says means anything, sure. You know, it could be a while before this appeal is decided and Alex ends up losing that, and likely ends up being sanctioned a ton for abuse of the appeals process along the way. But if the audience loses heart, that's a bigger danger. I went over to save Infowars the fundraiser they had to see how things stood, and he was about $200,000 on the afternoon of the 13th, the day after the verdict came in. So this is the evening of the 12th. Okay, so he's about 200,000. That seems to be about where you know, he can muster. Alex went all out on his show, Owen did what he could on the War Room, and then here we have Alex doing an emergency broadcast that retroactively became part of a marathon that became that started at 8am that day, and then went till midnight. Owen spent like three hours taking calls after Alex left in the first episode of Alex's long awaited all caller show, which actually still isn't the thing. It was just filling time. sure. They pulled out all the stops. And also, this is the tally after Alex's show on the 13th. And this is where they got to. It's a respectable number for sure. But it's not going to do shit for him in terms of staving off bankruptcy or paying lawyers enough to fight this two year appeal process. It seems like the free market is saying that the demand for Alex's show just doesn't justify its existence anymore. And I don't know, like I said this, this, never going to stop, thing, is making the lawyers, the plaintiffs lawyers case for them."

Russia made this move because they have a giant domestic gold supply. The Krastsvetmet plant in Siberia is one of the biggest in the world. And after they invaded Ukraine, these domestic gold producers were barred from selling to international markets. That would be really bad for a lot of folks with a lot of money and valuable commodities.

The rubles had gained in value, so they were getting screwed on the set gold price, so they decided to end it months before the program was set to run. So just to clarify, Steve is saying that the globalists want to start World War Three over the fact that Russia put their currency on a gold standard.

I walk into my room, which I had a bedroom in the basement. And the bottom line is Jesus physically appears, by the way, I wasn't drunk and I wasn't doing drugs, and Jesus all of a sudden, okay, okay, I fell at his feet as one door... and I couldn't get up. I couldn't get up, and the glory of the Lord and when I say Glory, if you want to know what Jesus looks like, go to Revelation chapter one. Because when he lifted me up, and I said, Lord, who are you? And he said, I'm Jesus, your Savior. And I'm giving you a Joseph's ministry. I didn't know what that meant. I didn't know who Joseph was. When he looked into my eyes. Every cell in my body exploded with His love, His forgiveness, I had an understanding of of just the magnificence of God, though I couldn't have told you one Bible story. You know, probably maybe one, Adam and Eve. And the bottom line is, is that we're like, it was so overwhelming for three hours. I basked I guess you'd say, praising him in his in his in just the presence of a living God. And after that he told me I would know him, now understand this is not a dream, this is not a vision. This is like terra firma on Eartha, and he said I know him... don't do that ever again. --through His Word, though and Alex, fast forward and you know, after this experience had to go out and speak to an Assembly of God pastor, because he's the only one that could let me know what it meant to have an encounter with Jesus Christ."
