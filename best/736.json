After the verdict came out on Thursday, we had the opportunity to sit down and chat with the plaintiff's attorney from the Texas cases. Mark Bankston about the you know the goings on to reflect a little bit on the the case and what were the most likely next steps. And that is a little bonus bonus bonus. That's what it is. It's a bonus little episode for this weekend for you all to enjoy. Sneaky snake and but here's the thing. Do me and Jordan had meant me up, man. I'm pronouncing things weird all over the place. Me and Jordan had meant to recorded an intro the like this what I'm what I'm doing here, but we forgot. Anyway, I just thought it would be weird if the episode started and then just immediately jumped into an interview. Maybe I'm wrong. I don't know. Maybe this is unnecessary. Anyway, before I get too up in my head. I'll just throw it to the interviewer enjoy. And we will be talking to you soon. Well, folks, I figured there's a lot of news. There's a billion stories to cover. Yeah. 965 million to be exact. Yeah, close to a billion stories. Yeah.

And, you know, it's weird because sometimes people that you don't think about it too much, that in a very technical sense, these cases of ours in Connecticut, in in Texas are in competition in a way like that. That would normally be the case. Right? But that has since almost the outset. Not been how we've treated it. Yeah. And these parents were so gracious to me. And so I mean, they were expressing their admiration and their thanks for what we did. And I don't even represent these folks. Right. But we've kind of stopped looking at it that way. Because, you know, I think we've said it in court many times, me and Chris are as cooperative as to plaintiff's lawyers across the country can ever be. And we have helped each other along this way to make sure that these people are not pulling fast ones in either direction. And so man, when that trial started, yeah, there was no other place in the world. I wanted to be try to help whatever way I could. And it was, it was a great experience to be there. And to be, I don't know, there was something about that particular courtroom and you have that amount of gravity of people in it. Yeah, of all of these plaintiffs. It was, it was quite an experience. But you know, like, like, a lot of people midway through the trial, and I had to leave and come home, because I actually had to come home for a couple days, and then go try another case at Kansas City. Nobody really knew what was gonna happen. Right. Nobody really knew."

And so I was almost concerned after my case, if people were going to look at it and go, All right, well, yeah, but that's just a total fluke, you've got one story of what happened to with neon, Scarlet where Neil gets to fame, and you get one result. That's just a fluke. And what's so rewarding about this next trial? Is it proves that's not a fluke. There's no fluke about it. Yeah. And that you can almost look at that. It's like the Heslin case is sort of the battering ram that breaks into that fortress sets the value sets understands how the case is going to go. And then Chris and his team just took that.

That's just how it's gonna be. And then then the question is, right, like so look, they have all these things going well, for them, they have the first trial with Jones that we had in Austin clearly broke his brain. Right, he came to that trial with the defense lawyer who was going to put on a fairly standard defense. He went in there and pretended that he had remorse. They tried to play the script of how you would supposedly defend this. And they got they got wrecked. And so it broke Alex's brain. So he shows up to the next trial, and he acts like a goddamn madman. He's up there on the stand said I don't apologize for shit and basically like an old enemy."

I mean, it's a mess. But here's the thing that I don't think people are putting enough attention on, is that while Chris petty had himself a really strong case, and really favorable conditions in the courtroom, he faced something that is so insanely difficult, which is when you have when you just have a win, it's just Neelam Scarlets one fan, right, you can get the number up, get it up there to 50 million and you're in your jury understands that.

And, but that has been transferred over into other entities or been given to other insiders. Right. The weird companies? Yeah, exactly. Like the one that would trips everybody's radar on this is PQ, PR. Right? Right. They set up, and there's a trust out there. You know, they say, Hey,"

Like, I'll make videos, I'll do whatever people like, yeah, like, you're not going to get rid of them that way. Either way you really have to do is to be able to marginalize and neuter his influence on American culture. Right? And that that really is kind of the goal, the whole thing, right? When these families realize that men they start to see that Parkland shooting happened, same stuff was happening, they're like, we can't just let this keep going. The suit itself, you gotta remember a suit gets filed in April. Lafferty suit pulls up a couple months later, Jones basically loses his mind over that period of time starts threatening to kill Robert Moeller starts posting just a bunch of stuff that like is like an attempt to get the tech giants to come after Mr. Most racist transphobic shit, and you know, all sorts of stuff. During that summer, he loses his mind, the combination of those two events, the lawsuit, and all of that caused the tech giants to D platform, which I still think was done in the most ridiculous, arbitrary way that kind of like points to their mistakes all through it, but like it got done. Right. And that was the first big effect of the suit. I really do think that you move past 2019 at 2018. Jones was basically at the height of his powers. And he was effectively defamed by the suit itself, then the deep platforming reduces the core size of his audience. And then now after the defaults, after all of it, after this constant drumbeat of how he's not taking it seriously, and then the verdicts, he has been heavily marginalized as in in a way that like, I'm not even sure that collecting the money makes that much more of a difference to tell you the truth. I mean, I think it will reduce the size of his media operation, but but his ultimate reach, I think, will probably be about the same margins."

And I think that could be helpful in some ways. Yeah. But then there's logistical things of like credit impacts of losing a case like these, and that's something that will will be a problem for him and In order to maintain whatever relevance he has, and ability to get audience, he has to have his own site like bamdad video that is intensely expensive for him with bandwidth costs. And the only way to keep getting people to go to the site is to offer a platform for weirdos like David Icke, and some of these other folks like that guy who dresses up like Uncle Sam and yells at people on the street. Like you, he has that stuff. And that's costing him an arm and a leg. And eventually, he's not going to be able to afford to run this site, and other people aren't going to pony up the money for that.

If if a prosecutor had the balls to do it, he could have prosecuted for this.

Wow, that's a good little act. There's no punitive damage cap for that. And so here, yeah, it is definitely going to be our argument in court on the 20 if that Jones committed a felony in this act, and that he very well could have been prosecuted.

Even though embarrassed as attorney was really, you know, rewarding in its own way. It makes all these late night shows just dissolve that you get this sort of feeling from it. But you know that it's just you're just opening the door on this whole, the final chapter, right? We said at the end of that Trump is the beginning of the end, right? There's still, like so much to see that didn't happen with a sequel that sets literally a record setting verdict, right, like, and that feels good to know. And to know, he's got two more Sydney. And I think something that some people haven't even really thought about it in this equation is that many Posner and Verity calorosa, their damages, direct damage from this are probably the most outrageous of anybody involved in this. Yeah. And for a long duration that that it really is he's got that last one he's looking at there is really, really threatening. And then look, even even with Marcel's case, which didn't have like the years long effect, is still really repugnant. And he's very possibly facing a big verdict there as well. And so you're gonna have some more of this. But the fact that the fact is, is we filed our suits near each other. In the library, people came a couple of months after mine. And then over the course of these four years, even with the procedural differences in the case, we basically stayed neck and neck. And so to have it come down to even after all the appeals aren't trials are like a month apart, to have this one two punch. It's like the story being told, it's amazing. It couldn't have worked out any better. It really is. And, and that kind of brings you back to another point, I think it's super important that people need to realize and that needs to get said more by people can say the sorts of things of like, oh, Alex Jones could have put on a First Amendment offense, but but he chose not to participate and therefore got defaulted. So he didn't get to do that. And that's actually not sure is that in the beginnings of the case, in both states, he was allowed to bring an anti slap motion that challenges his first amendment rights and all of that stuff. And he actually had all of that heard on the merits. He had appeals up to the Texas Court of Appeals, and up to the Texas Supreme Court, you can go read like one of them, it's really spells it all out really nice as the positive versus Jones opinion from the Texas Court of Appeals. And they go through these issues, all of the First Amendment things that he would want, he had every chance to do that he got a fair shake in court to do that. It wasn't until he came back from that, and still over the years, but just didn't participate, that that's when he ended up getting defaulted on the merits to trial. So he got to try to vindicate his first amendment rights, and it failed it because this, this has nothing to do with the first of them and you know, false facts about identifiable people,"
