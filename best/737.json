You know, at one point they asked to hear the testimony again, of William Sherlach, who's a wife, Mary Sherlach was the school psychologist who died at Sandy Hook. And there was this, you know, thought in the room? Well, okay. Let's think, his name appears on the bottom of the jury verdict form. So does that mean they're nearing the end? Yeah. All right, try and, you know, figure it all out. And kind of game through it to see, well, what does that mean? And one question, in particular, that the jury asked was this thing where they said, What does it mean, there's this kind of archaic language in the law, in these sorts of cases. And it's what does it, you know, the instruction to the jury is, try to put the plaintiff back into the position when you, you know, levy these damages, try to put them back into position they were before the harm occurred. And, you know, that works for things like, you know, a broken contract. So, you know, you can say, well, here's the income you would have had, if that person hadn't broken, illegally broken the contract or, you know, a personal injury, you know, you're paying for hospitalization, and maybe special care and things like that. But when it comes to defamation, and you know, reputational damage and things like that, and reputational damage to someone who has lost someone in this way, how do you ever get them back to where they started? You know, that's, it becomes almost a philosophical question. So yeah, it's a, you know, it was just, you know, everyone was thinking, what are they thinking when they're asking that question? Are they thinking, you know, no amount of money? Are they thinking any amount of money, you know, how, how are they grappling with that?

And so Norm said, I think, you know, it's probably best instead I'm, and also I think a strategic play, there's some lawyers who are commenting on Twitter who are more knowledgeable and you know, on the on the legal strategy and and they were saying it's favorable to his client if Norm would decline to do the cross like that and instead call his own client as the defense witness. So he reserved the right to do that. They made a deal with the families' lawyers where they would have the right to cross if he if Norm called him and he came back. And so Norm said, he's not going to testify today. He's going to come back next week. And I will call him as a witness. And this is agreeable to the families' lawyers, and then they will have another crack at him, basically. And he and what he said was, that'll lower the temperature in the room. You know, I think it will be better. So I interpreted that. And having seen the jurors' reactions to Jones's testimony the day prior, I interpreted that, as you know, Norm says, he's, his client has damaged himself so much that you might want to give the jury a break, something to that effect,"

I, I was a little surprised at that, because some of his, you know, messaging to the media in, you know, the years leading up to the trial was sort of, well, these families think that they'll, they'll, you know, that they won't be examined themselves? Well, they will be and, you know, he had a lot of, well, we know, he had a lot of their personal records, and health records and things like that. And the reason we know that is, of course, they were wrongly transmitted to the attorneys in Texas. And, you know, he had to come up for a hearing on that, because that shouldn't have been done. So, you know, but once the families were on the stand and testifying as to what they'd been through, he had very little to say, uh, he, he didn't, you know, Robbie Parker and what Robbie has endured in this case, or over the years from Alex Jones, where he played that, you know, opening few seconds of Robbie Parker's press conference, the night after his daughter, Emilie was killed at Sandy Hook, over and over and over again for years. So Robbie was really at the center of this case, and Alissa Parker, Emilie's mom also testified. And she's not a plaintiff, but the two of them just portray, you know, just painted this nightmare of, you know, torment and death threats and people knowing where they lived, and a man confronting Robbie, you know, four years after the shooting on the street in Seattle, and all of these things. And Norm did have, did not have a single question for either one of them. Which was really pretty surprising. But then again, this is testimony so powerful that you wonder, really, what is there to say,"

You can't talk about political figures. You can't discuss Jones's finances, because we remember in, in Austin in August, you know, he tried to say wrongly that he was bankrupt, and that 2 million would be more than he could, you know, just about all or more than he could handle in terms of a verdict, you know, so on and so on. So all of that was sort of off the table. But, you know, lawyers try to, you know, get around that to in to then, you know, in presenting their cases. And so, you know, a couple of times in mentioning some of the families' charities, you know, he was talking about well, is, and basically, Isn't this about gun violence? Isn't this about gun control? And isn't this about politics? You know, that, didn't you? Uh, well, he mentioned this when the Wheelers testified because Francine Wheeler, about I can't remember how long after the shooting a month or two, after the shooting, delivered President Obama's radio address on a Saturday, and this was when the families were pushing for expanded background checks. And that legislation wound up failing. But as part of that effort, she delivered the radio address and Norm brought that up. So it's a way to get both guns and politics, you know, back into the the jury's minds. And I think the calculus there may have been, that there would have been some people on the jury who might have been sympathetic to that argument that, okay, so this was, there was a political aspect here or something like that. But I think as these stories mounted, and as, you know, just the sort of horror of what some of these people had endured, became more and more apparent, I think, you know, Norm wisely decided that this wouldn't be worth it. But you know, st trying to say, Oh, well, you voted for Hillary Clinton, is not going to cut it. When you have jurors weeping at the idea that, you know, people who had just lost their loved ones were getting death threats, rape threats, people threatening to dig up their murdered children, and, you know, talking about defiling their graves, you know, saying, oh, wasn't this all about gun control? Just sort of pales as an argument."

And it was extremely powerful. And I think that's another reason that Alex Jones didn't return to the courtroom because we saw what happened when Scarlett Lewis through an accident of timing wound up, you know, confronting him and for 90 minutes addressing the answer to every question directly at Alex Jones and asking him, you know, why are you doing this and truth is so important to our society. Truth is the bedrock on which our democracy rests, you say you're concerned about the country, and you're spreading things like this? What, what's wrong with you, basically, and I think, at all costs, I mean, having watched him literally sweat through his shirt while she was talking to him, I think the idea of sitting in front of 15 plaintiffs just, I don't think he could do it.

Any as, close as he got to this, if he got close to this process, that it would sort of expose him as this guy who's just a huckster and selling products, and doing it, you know, on the backs of these people, and lying about this and having to acknowledge that he had been lying about this for years, that that would damage him with his audience.

What I yeah, what I, from what I gathered, first of all, a gigantic exhale in the room, you know, just a sense of, wow, you know, we, we kind of took back our story, you know, we we, we were able to tell the world what happened, we were able to explain by explaining what happened, we were able to explain the dangers here of this sort of culture of disinformation and lies for profit. And, you know, and explain that this is a phenomenon that's not confined to to Alex Jones, and has really in the decades since Sandy Hook, occurred again and again. And, you know, he himself and this was a point I made in the story I wrote about the verdict. You know, he has been a part of most of the highest profile, viral lies over the decades since Sandy Hook, you know, whether you're talking about Pizzagate, or you know, Coronavirus myths and anti vax stuff. And, you know, the great replacement theory that drove the violence in Charlottesville, and certainly the 2020 election conspiracy theories that led to the violence at the Capitol on January 6th. So, you know, I think that their sense was by speaking about what happened to them, and how this all got started, and how long it's lasted, they were speaking to that. And, you know, and really trying to help, you know, claiming, you know, not only claiming their their, you know, their their story and saying, you know, this is that, as Robbie put it, you know, in the press conference afterwards, you know, he found his voice. He was silent about this for so long because he didn't want the abuse to get worse. He was really worried about the safety of his family. And, and, you know, he he finally got to a point when he saw that, you know, Parkland parents were receiving the same kind of abuse. And that just horrible statistic that today, nearly 20% of Americans believe that every high profile mass shooting is a plot by the government. Yeah, and is fake. You know, they were able to sort of say, Hey, this is something really serious that isn't not only impacting us, this is not a one off, this, we were the, you know, a foundational story and what is now a phenomenon, and the fact that they were able to raise that I think was was really satisfying to them. And, and we owe them our gratitude for that, because as you could see from watching the proceedings, it did not come easily for them to you know, it was extremely painful for them to, to, you know, raise that alarm, and and, you know, and relay and recall what had happened. So, yeah, so I think in that sense, you know, and again, sticking with what Robbie was saying, afterwards, you know, that they stood, they sat there, they went through it, they told the truth, and everybody on that stand, and this is these are Robbie's words, not mine. Everybody on that stand, told the truth, except for one person. yeah. And you know, and I think that that is"

But by doing this, the trial itself, to me kind of reinforces just how bad Alex is, without allowing Alex to poison people's minds with all of the other shit with all the politics and the emotional bullshit, all the things that can get them angry and distract them. Without that, there is no misinformation a reasonable group of people, and you know, there were Republicans on the jury, a reasonable group of people will look at that shit and go, that is a monster. It is only by Alex Jones's ability to inject those things that we get to where Alex Jones is in trial. You know what I'm saying?"
