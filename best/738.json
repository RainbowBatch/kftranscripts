The audience of the show is, as Steven Crowder has tweeted about before, it's at least half of the audience is under 16. So this show is white children. And I haven't been able to confirm that figure in any way. But he said it and I have no reason to doubt it. He has the analytics can you do that? I guess you can feel"

Okay, one of the reasons I've avoided doing too much about Crowder up till this point is that he has a lot of his content behind paywalls. For instance, the last time Alex was on for his weird performatively masculine cigar club session. The first part of it was public, but then the rest of it that you'd actually want to watch is not we may be coming to a point where I stop over respecting these ding dongs intellectual property, but I don't think I'm quite there yet. Steven Crowder is repugnant. He's a horrible person and his career has been a shameful series of horrible embarrassments that he's been able to parlay into having a very successful YouTube talk show that appeals to kids with sophomore IQ, racist jokes and sophomore IQ anti LGBTQ jokes. I don't want to do too deep dive on his trajectory. But here's a summation of his career path. Okay. He tried to be a stand up comedian, but he sucked at it. So to a right wing grift catching the attention of Fox News when he got punched in the face by a union protester who he was harassing Great, this rose his stature and he began making his own content, most notably a segment called change my mind where he would show up at a college campus and sit at a table waiting for college students on their way to class to join him for a spirited debate."

And I want you to correct me if I have this wrong. So in 2017, as an example, because the narrative is Sandy Hook, you torment to the parents, you call them out by name, and you continually harass them from what I understand. And I have some quotes in front of me, and I want you to tell me, if I'm misquoting you, you admit that you were wrong, and you apologize. And I think that's key, because they still want to go after you anyway. So 2017, you talked about an epiphany you had on Father's Day, you said, Forgive me, on Father's Day, I want to reach out to the parents of the slain children at the horrible tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut, and give you my sincere condolences. You said that, right? Yes, okay. You also said like, I'd also like to reach out to any of the parents who lost a child at New New Town to invite them to contact me to open a dialogue. Because I think it's really essential. We do that, instead of letting the mainstream media misrepresent things, and really try and drive this nation apart. You said that right. Before they sued me, yes, before they sued you. And then in 2019, and in deposition, you said, and I, myself, have almost like a form of psychosis in the past where I basically thought everything was staged, even though I've now learned, a lot of times, things aren't staged. And I'm not saying this to embarrass you. I'm saying it because you were clear and that you had a change of heart or you believe that you were wrong, or you believed you made a mistake, which I think is admirable. And I think the fact that they want to browbeat you after that is what is so scary."

The only problem is I've seen a lot of soap operas, and I've seen actors before. And I know when I'm watching a movie, and when I'm watching something real, that was in late 2016. Alex only said the things that Stephens reading because of the Megyn Kelly interview that was about to come out, Alex knew was going to come out around Father's Day and Neil Heslin was going to be interviewed in it so he was trying to get ahead of any controversy. He was also still repeating the basic conspiracy theories about the shooting at this point, just holding back some things that he thought could be legally actionable. Stevens also ignoring that after this point, oh, and Shroyer did his video about how Neil Heslin couldn't have held his son after the shooting. And Alex reported on that, which in many ways really does undo any goodwill that he might want to pretend he has from his feigned apology. Stevens also ignoring that in October 2017, Alex said quote, it's as phony as a $3 bill with CNN doing fake newscasts and blue screens. Stephens also ignoring that Alex has said that he thinks Sandy Hook probably was fake at least twice on air while the trials have been ongoing, including once in the last two weeks. There's a good and fun to create the straw man versions of what Alex actually did. And the reason he's facing consequences but it's not real. Steven knows it's not real, but Alex's existence is pretty helpful for his brand. So we pretend this and you know, the people who are watching Stephens show probably don't have any interest in debunking this nonsense that he's feeding them. Yeah,"

What he would maybe try to do is insinuate himself even more with Alex, and get involved with like, the infrastructure, part of bamdad video, and that kind of thing, and try and use it as a like a reinforcing misinformation. Sort of YouTube, because as it stands, now, there's a shallow depth of anything interesting on there, there's plenty of content. That's true. There's Info Wars stuff, and there's a load of bullshit. Steven is like, I don't think it's in his best interest necessarily to be hooked with Glenn Beck with the blaze stuff, but maybe there's some good money there. But in terms of like, if you want some of Alex's audience and that stuff, and he wants to create, like more of a space, yeah, that would be the thing you'd do, maybe and then try and rope in some of the other weirdos"

It's a search box for the back end of Google. And a lot of you have to pay for it. We've never paid for it. We've barely ever used it.

If Stephen really wanted to be prepared to ask this question and respond appropriately to Alex's answer, he should have read the order for the default judgment. It spells everything out. There were requests for production that Alex never even responded to. There are requests to produce people for depositions that were ignored. Alex repeatedly sent completely unprepared people to depositions as a corporate representatives. And that's just the surface. Alex did turn over big batches of documents, but he had a habit of doing that just before hearings about his failure to turn over documents, so he could avoid consequences while overwhelming the plaintiffs with tons of unrelated shit. Even these tranches weren't satisfactory to what he was obligated to turn over though, and it didn't really help him. Yeah. In the judgment, they even discuss how they tried to resolve the problem through fines and sanctions, but it was clear that it had no effect on Alex's abuse of the discovery process. He has too much money to be impacted by whatever fines the court could impose. So it was a dead end. Steven doesn't care about the reality here or the truth. He's just asking questions to allow Alex to give his boilerplate rehearsed answer and make it look like Steven was asking tough questions.

Quite frankly, the way inflation is going the way it accelerates towards, why am I Republican Zimbabwe? In 10 years, there's such inflation, a billion dollars will be like $1,000. Yeah, I mean, at the current rate we're at here, so be like, No, I'm not scared. I am disgusted. And I really feel proud of myself. Because I've told the truth about this.
