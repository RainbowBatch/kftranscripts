And their answer to most things is, I don't know, good question, really. And he that young man was able to persuade a trial judge in Texas that this was willful failure, that the corporation had an obligation to produce a representative that could answer his questions because there had to be answers. And so there was a nother deadline in Texas to produce a corporate rep. We selected I selected a person from Connecticut because no one else it Infowars was willing to do it again.

I mean, I don't know if Alex is going to get a percentage of the royalties for the space. Oh, good luck.

The job he had with Textbroker is the sort of thing where he would get paid to write little blurbs for websites sort of a freelance gig thing. Sure, sure. This is where you might go, if you want someone to write a paragraph about a lamp you're selling and you don't want to pay too much. Textbroker is also the sort of place you might go to get filler for a website that's designed for gaming affiliate link systems. To give you some sense of the operation. In their basic category of services, you can choose their low rate option, which has this blurb, this is how it describes that service did they write their own blurb using their service they might have Okay, quote, I accept mistakes in spelling, grammar and expression in favor of a lower price for writing where you could just write what you can just write what random misspelled words, you can make about 1.1 cents per word for that. If you have to pay attention to spelling and grammar you can make up to about like 5.5 cents, all right? To be clear, I'm not knocking the hustle. And there's no shame in this kind of gig. It's just not necessarily the sort of writing work you do. If you had in demand skills in that field, and it's something that maybe isn't a great thing to be like on the resume for the job that he ends up him."

The first is really transparent, which is how a conspiracy theorist answers a question. A Don has asked why he was suspicious about 911 But it's a conspiracy he hasn't focused on in a while, so a lot of the talking points are a bit foggy in his memory. So he tries to give a vague non answer, then Maddie asks for something more specific and Adan base Because this guy like it doesn't seem right and building seven as his response, which is pretty soft. Yeah. The second thing is something that will become important later is some of Maddies questions develop. This is something that Adan is suspicious about. He has some inconclusive things to point to that he can use to justify these suspicions. And based on having those suspicions he just testified to Matty that led him to suspect the US government was involved. This provides a clear example of a Don's thought process where he's willing to take things that look weird and make him suspicious and use them to build a baseless explanatory narratives. Hold on to this for later because it will become clear how relevant this is to the matter at hand. And how much of a mistake this was on a Don's part in reflection, yeah, maybe it doesn't, you know, lead to any direct consequences. But if you're analyzing this and looking at the way he describes his process and how he interacts with information, it's very damning. And it will that'll become clear later. Yeah."

The conspiracy the dawn spread about Sandy Hook and Batman had to do with a name Sandy Hook appearing on the map in the movie Dark Knight Rises. That was an article Rappaport wrote on December 18, but the one from the 16th, which has been discussed here since it was forwarded to a dawn is actually about something else. The Batman part of this has to do with the Aurora shooting happening at a screening of Batman and the theories about James Holmes thinking he was the Joker. And this article Sandy Hook relates to the Hunger Games. I'm just going to read you here. Some of John Rapoport brilliant work. Oh please. quote, we now have the boggling connection to the Hunger Games, and that sci fi novel and film 24 Children are picked to take part in a competitive national blood sacrifice killing ritual. One child survives at the end and 23 Die 20 died in Newtown and the author of The Hunger Games Suzanne Collins lives in Sandy Hook Next, a new town. And this means this is just the kind of bizarre and insane ops secret societies are reputed to enjoy. Ordinarily, I would ignore this sort of thing and just call it a coincidence, but it's too improbable. I can't prove the killings in New Town were part of a kind of up, but I can't disregard it either. The quote coincidence is just too stunning. And if the Hunger Games connection is real here, then all bets are off. The coincidence that Rappaport finds too stunning is that Suzanne Collins lives nearby and the number of children who are killed in The Hunger Games that doesn't match the number of dead at Sandy Hook, but it's kind of close plus"

Because where there's smoke, there's usually fire. Oh my god, what we found is interesting to say the least. It seems like this isn't quite how he's describing his writing in this deposition is Christ from the article. It sounds like they were studying these maps searching for clues to prove that there was foreign knowledge and that they found interesting stuff and where there's smoke, there's usually fire seems pretty overt and it's point I would say, yeah, and Adan doesn't point out that the prop master was from Sandy Hook, he does bring up that there's a sandy hook in New Jersey, but it's kind of a non sequitur between heavy insinuation of a conspiracy and then this quote for those who are left asking why would someone do this? Okay, Alfred Pennyworth. Bruce Wayne Oh says have an evil force and the Dark Knight movie some men aren't looking for anything logical like money they can't be bought, bullied reasoned or negotiated with some men just want to watch the world burn.

The video is a tell all leave no stone unturned work that coalesces hundreds of data points, which researchers laborious Lee spent countless hours compiling. That certainly sounds like what you might write if the video was too long, you couldn't even make it through the whole thing and you can't even really nail down what the point of it was. Also, the article includes this update, quote, a previous version of this video was removed from YouTube due to a copyright claim by Lenny Posner. Posner is reportedly the parent of one of the children supposedly killed at Sandy Hook, reportedly and supposedly both and that sentence is pretty over, over go. Fuck.

It would just be a reaction, you'd start asking yourself things like how is this possible? Is there information I'm missing? What's the context here? Is it possible for both this table to be accurate and the shooting happened as was reported, the not questioning is actually a choice a Don is making and he does that because if he scratched even an inch below the surface, he couldn't make the insane claims that he does make for a living. He is woefully unqualified and doesn't have the tools to be in the role he pretends to be in, which is that of a writer and reporter Yeah, that ability to turn off the instinct to question things when something conforms to your narrative while simultaneously yelling at your audience about how you're the people who question things.
