But what's interesting about the game is that it's about finding the connections between things. So they'll give you like a clue. And then they'll give you another clue. And then we'll have to figure out what connects all four of these things. So that impulse that so many people have towards making up connections, you know, our brains are wired to find connections even if they aren't there. It can be used for good to find out weird strange things like they might play four songs and you'd be like, Oh, in Greek these all start with an eye like it's that kind of level of Yoda. Yeah, how specific you have to be to combine those things. And it just be like three pop songs. And the only an obscene insane person will be like, well, obviously, you translate the title to Greek. And then if you do that, you can see that all four of these are the same thing."

The cases that have already happened, the the illusions about the appeal, right, the bankruptcy process, all of this stuff clearly requires a ton of attention.

Now the thing is Skype testing on the road is always a hassle. So that's going on right now as we speak with them. So I'd rather be in there monkeying around with that to make sure it all happens because the bigger the interview, the more Gremlins snack foods tend to get in the way but that's not something I'm particularly worried about here today.

That's a basically inexplicable, quarter inexplicable. And if you want to say like, during a moment of silence, people shouldn't yell anything. Yeah. And that's fine, but you're making it a little bit targeted here a little bit. So what happened was the Trump said something completely inaccurate. And then instead of admitting that he was wrong, he pretended he'd made a completely different claim altogether. He initially said, quote, I watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down. And I watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where 1000s and 1000s of people were cheering as the building was coming down. 1000s of people were cheering so something's going on. We've got to find out what it is. a Washington Post article from around 911 does mention unverified claims of small amounts of people allegedly celebrating on a rooftop, but there's no video evidence of this ever happening. Reporters have estimated that it was maybe six to 12 Teenagers quote, but even that is doubtful. So that could be what he's talking about. But he said he saw a video. Anyway, at this point when Alex is interviewing him, the goalposts have completely moved. And now Trump is declaring that he was correct because someone found video of Palestinian celebrating in the occupied West Bank. This is not what Trump had claimed, and what people were saying he was making up. This is the state of things at this point, and Trump is not at all vindicated. Also, Alex should be really against Trump's idea of surveilling mosques. That seems wildly against Alex's principles about freedom of religion and the Fourth Amendment, but I guess he doesn't really care about those things too much when the group being targeted to someone other than himself. And you have Trump essentially arguing for increased surveillance in a way that Alex would decry. Is tyranny in any other context? And instead of giving any pushback, he's just right along with Trump in it, and that's not not, he should have stayed up for hours preparing his questions and maybe stealing his resolve to be able to push back in this setting."

And now people are seeing that the same, you know, Trump predicted Osama bin Laden, which actually is true. And then two years later, a year and a half later, he knocked down the World Trade Center.

Also, this is a little bit before he got into his pizza gate bullshit. also noting is worth noting is that this trip that Biggs went on is something that we actually have some insight into thanks to information relayed by Josh Owens, in his piece in The New York Times, he worked for Infowars and was along for this very trip that's going to be discussed. Here's how he described it to the times. Quote, In December 2015, the day before Jones interviewed Donald Trump still a candidate at the time on his radio show, I made my way to upstate New York on assignment along with a reporter and second cameraman, we were sent to visit Muslim majority communities throughout the United States to investigate what Jones instructed us to call the American caliphate after the California Geiger counter debate debacle that was when they were sent out to get evidence that there was radiation and what have you and it didn't work out. It's very funny. We had meetings with Jones before trips in order to ascertain exactly what he wanted. If we quote hit some home runs, he said we would get significant bonuses. They tried to make contact with folks in a community called Islam Berg, but were turned away because of concerns for security. From Josh's article, quote, because of the conspiracy theories about the place Islam Berg was a constant target of right wing extremists. That April a Tennessee man was arrested and later convicted of plotting to raise a militia to burn Islam Berg's mosque to the ground. Only days before we arrived, the FBI had issued an alert to law enforcement to be on the lookout for a man named John Retimer, a leader of an anti Muslim movement in Arizona who posted a video threatening violence against Muslims less than two weeks earlier. So the phone call we received later that night from a law enforcement agent shouldn't have come as a surprise. The officer who contacted us said he simply wanted to verify who we were after receiving a concern call from somebody in Islaam Burg when he told Jones about it, and he chose to believe the call was a veiled threat and attempt to intimidate us into silence. To him this verified that we were onto something. He even went so far as to include Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City in the purported conspiracy, claiming he wanted to abolish the Second Amendment and that somehow intimidating us would achieve that. Jones told us to file a story that accused the police of harassment lending credence to the theory that this community contain dangerous potential terrorists. I knew this wasn't the case according to the information we had. We all did. Days before we spoke to the sheriff and the mayor of deposit New York nearby municipality. They both told us the people in his Lomberg were kind, generous neighbors who welcomed the surrounding community into their homes, even celebrating holidays together. The information did not meet our expectations. So we made it up preying on the vulnerable and feeding the prejudices and fears of Jones's audience. We ignored certain facts fabricated others and took situations out of context to fit our narrative. So that's going on right now. Joe Biggs is filing the first report from this clear, fraudulent coverage that was meant intentionally to stoke agitate against Muslim communities. Yep. And you can hear even in Alex's coverage of this video that Biggs is going to be airing that is American caliphate. The framing Yeah, came from Alex himself. And it was like, This is what you're going out to create justification for coverage. Right. And it's pretty sad. It's pretty sad. Yeah. It's the same day that Trump is on the show. Yeah,"

I kept pounding their faces in and jumping on them and ramming their head in the ground. until they realize how all the tops of shops might have blood coming out their ears and they'd say, My God, how'd you just beat up this 1617 year old who weighs 230 pounds and you weigh 160 pounds? What's going on with your kid? And I said, listen, they attacked me. And I stood up for myself. Sometimes those bullies when I had their head knocking at the pavement would ask the question. And by the way, these aren't Ben Carson stories, they're a lot worse than I tell you. Everybody knows it. Everybody's got a sixth sense.
