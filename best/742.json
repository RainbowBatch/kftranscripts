One person has text messages on their phone, but you don't have them. And I don't I don't understand anybody that has cell phones knows that they're different ones have different things. There's different things going on. And I don't understand it all. But but but as in the case of the emails, we should have just for cost of money been getting rid of them, but we had them going back 15 years, million 10s of millions, obviously, you guys were able to get those. So if anything, we have really no policy at all on data retention. It's just it's just retained, unless you know, things like text messages sometimes don't get saved."

By just keeping on target. Maddie is able to get Alex to concede that he has absolutely no idea what text messages were actually turned over to the plaintiffs lawyers. Alex's pronouncements about how much he cooperated are matters of certainty. he when he's rambling on his show, or when he's grandstanding at a disgraceful press conference outside the courtroom, but when he's actually forced to answer yes or no, if he has any idea what he actually did for discovery, he doesn't know anything. This is Alex's answer, because it's less of a problem than him saying that he intentionally withheld things, which seems like a far more likely situation to me at this point. Yeah. So yeah, it's it's good because you know, you have that DOJ have we turned over everything? Sure. What do you know about what you turned out?

And anyway, it's right in line with what I've kind of had as a thesis for a long time. And that is the enemy of any of these people with specificity. You don't want to be nailed down to anything. So it's like, is that what you said? That's what the internet said? Yep. No, you just said that. Yeah. And the the one of the problems with specificity is that as you pursue it, these theories start to really sound dumb. Because the implications of these people being actors are clear. Like, it's clearly not something that's well thought through by the people who promoted these theories. Right. And this is explored by Maddie in this next clip, about how like, how would this make sense? Right, right. Let's imagine that Robbie Parker is an actor. If that then what else must be true? Yeah,"

But I'm, I'm happy they did, because it's really true, that I didn't consciously get up there, and try to misrepresent or a lot of people, I've gotten somewhat better over the years, because most of what I say is accurate and true. And I've gotten better as the show's gotten so much more successful. I've gotten older, it's taught me how to do things better. But I did not make those with the psychosis. And I don't have a psychosis, I said, it's almost like a form of that. And it's happening everywhere, where people don't believe anything anymore. From the corporate media or the government anything because they've been lied to so much. And it's really the system's fault that people have lost total comp, competence or, or confidence in it. And it's a real crisis. And I learned right around this time, when I started pulling away from things like Sandy Hook and other events where they thought everything was a crisis actor, and I was Beau Bridges. And that I'm Bill Hicks, and crazy people coming to my office and you know, saying I was covering up a shooting in the in Texas and that I was there. And I was this person. And I just started thinking, you know, just because the media lies some of the time it gets things wrong and the government does doesn't mean every time it is and I saw the craziness for both ends. The establishment wanted to censor want to stop anybody questioning. You got everybody over here believing nothing. They say finding reasons not to believe it. It's just it's like staring into the abyss you become the abyss. And so I've been I've been honest about, you know, what went on here. And then as soon as I began to say, I don't want those people on the show. You got the emails and stuff and I don't want people I don't want any more of that, than those people said that I was on the government. A roll that I was covering up Sandy Hook. And then they"
