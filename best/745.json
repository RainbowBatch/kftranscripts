But also, I think that this clip offers a really good insight into Alex's mind and how these conspiracies work. Because if you look at it, it's basically exactly what we say pretty regularly is what he's articulating. He sees an event that's threatening to his ideology, and he knows that he has no actual argument about it, and that the people on the other side of the issue have points that he cannot in any way rebut. Instead of recognizing that and working on strengthening his arguments or attempting to find a compromise solution. Alex takes a shortcut of saying that this threatening event didn't happen. When there's a mass shooting, all gun owners aren't blamed for it. But Alex feels like they are because to him discussion of gun regulation isn't a matter of making better public policy. It's something that's being done to punish people who have guns. This is obviously inaccurate, but it serves as a launching pad for Alex to make the leap to where he wants to go, which is to say that the shooting itself is fake. So there's no reason to punish gun owners, which would not happening to begin with. If Alex had to counter the actual arguments, people who propose gun regulation are making he would fall flat. He showed all he has when he went on Piers Morgan show like it's just a bunch of yelling and aggressive statements, but there's no actual substance there. This is all just intellectual cowardice. Alex can't stand up to the actual ideas in the arena like he likes to think he can. So he takes the shortcut of taking world events personally and then insisting they didn't happen. The event didn't happen because the globalists who are really just trying to punish me to begin with, so they fake this event in order to give them a justification to do it. You can easily see how this allows Alex to sidestep any actual policy discussions because he's not equipped to have them. Also, no therapist would allow this kind of justification to stand without further exploration absurd. It's just a case of clear projection and rationalization that you'd have to have a normal level therapist in order to accept and move past That's outrageous. Yeah,"

He has to be able to recall so easily that Glenn Beck was the one who is obsessed with the Tides Foundation. He is bad at this. Alex isn't totally off the hook though, because his conspiracy stuff feeds into backs and backs whole thing about the Tides Foundation traced back to just being another Soros puppet master narrative, right. So it's all basically the same shit with slightly different labels. Byron Williams was also a reader of Infowars. In his jailhouse confession, he said, quote, I'm actually mad at Fox, I'm mad at them, because they go on to something else. It's like they drop the issue, and it lands on a shelf somewhere to collect dust. And that's what's happening to the truth. It's going out and collecting dust. I say, you're not going to let these people get away with this stuff. You can't let them get away with it. So this was my action because of foxes neglect. This isn't an insane perspective. This is the logical endpoint of the narratives that people like Alex and Beck disseminate. This guy is expressing an understandable disappointment that these people who claim to have uncovered the truth in these grand conspiracies, they just move on to some other topic, and they never actually do anything. Seems weird, doesn't it? Obviously, it's not rational to shoot up a foundation. But it makes total sense for someone who believes in someone like Alex or beck to get to the point where they've had enough with the inaction. Why isn't anybody doing anything? It's that tension state. Yeah, that Alex and Glenn Beck's propaganda is meant to keep people totally. And some people will inevitably break under that, that that amount of tension, right. It's designed, that's a feature,"
