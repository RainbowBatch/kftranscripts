Oh, and is after six. So we're probably already live. God damn them. There doesn't seem to have been a broad power outage in LA that night. It was probably really local to their studio, maybe even just their building. It might have been some other tech issue that they were calling a power outage is shorthand to who knows.

The voter has to decide that Right, the error that's most often picked up appears to be over voting where the machine doesn't read which candidate the voter picked in a certain race. The poll worker has the ability to override this with the voters consent, and the machine will then count all the other votes cast. But in that race, no vote will be tabulated. And again, this is something that the voter has to sign off on, right. This is a video of a very kind and patient lady explaining to this caller how they deal with the tech at polling place.

He's a person who has absolutely no interest in or knowledge about historical voting patterns, so he couldn't even credibly say whether or not Fetterman getting over 90% of the vote in Philadelphia County is in line with past election right. In reality, Philadelphia County contains two congressional districts Pennsylvania's second and third districts. The second district is a Democrat plus 25 district and went 72.9% to Clinton and 24.9% to Trump in 2016. And the spread was even wider for Obama Romney in 2012. However, the third district is Democrat plus 41. District. That's a big plus, and neither Romney nor Trump even got over 10% of the vote there. Pennsylvania's Third District is one of the most democratic voting districts in the country in cooks partisan index, their latest analysis, they were only behind Maryland's fourth, which is just outside DC, and California is 12, which includes Oakland and Berkeley, right. Pennsylvania's third is a more strongly Democrat area than San Francisco, Chicago, and pretty much all of LA and New York, right. Oh, and doesn't know these things. And he doesn't know that seeing early returns, like the ones he's talking about should be totally expected. Because he's stupid and uninformed. He takes his very normal phenomenon and translates it into a conspiracy. Also, Fetterman didn't end up with that high of a share of the votes in Philadelphia County. As of the time that I was preparing this, his win was only at about 82.1%, which actually represents an over performance there by Dr. Oz. Notice how I'm commenting on how oz got more votes than one might have expected but somehow I'm not implying that that's a result of a nefarious conspiracy."

This is Alex thinking on his feet and coming up with a new framework for the audience to use to claim that the election was being stolen, namely that it was machines breaking down in key districts, that's to blame. Keep in mind that Alex has not proven in any way that machines are broken down in key districts, nor is even illustrated it poorly. The closest thing was that one color from before Alex was even there. That was there's too much humidity in Oklahoma. And no matter where he was in Oklahoma, that was not a key district. This is a good illustration of why fact checking doesn't really matter in terms of opposing someone like Alex, he just manufactures whatever reality is most convenient for him and allows him to tell the stories he wants to tell and that he knows will be most profitable to tell his audience or respect for reality's existence is a requirement for having your facts checked. And Alex doesn't give a shit about that. It's the same thing. Same dynamic that was a play with Owen trying to check the past results in Philadelphia County, it doesn't matter, you're just going to come up with a new story that under undergirds the point that you want to make,"

He just thinks it's a place that's subject to colonialism like to say that the Democrats have colonized the US but that's not what a banana republic is. Very specifically, a banana republic is characterized by being a country whose economy is solely dependent on exporting its own natural resources. Typically this involves a single resource. That's the basis of the economy, like the bananas were in Central American countries like Honduras and Guatemala, when they were under the sway of giant American fruit companies. You could make the argument that the way that those large corporations held so much political power based on their control over a single resource that this country's economy relied on, it's similar to how many of the giant companies in the US have outsized political influence due to their involvement in things like the energy markets, but I don't think that's a conversation ally or anyone at Infowars really wants to have because at the end of the day, they err on the side of those big corporations.
