And so I think this stuff is really important to discuss and important to cover Okay, and we're not going to not continue to, nor are we going to not follow Alex in the present in such of course, but we I think you run the risk of if we only talk about that stuff. Yeah, it gives a overwhelming perception of maybe how uniform it is, you know what I mean? Like, if if our show is all that right, I worry about the listeners taking in too much of that and like giving the sense that we think that everything all around is white supremacist and Nazis.

But right off the bat, it can't be the CPS because this is a story that happened in Canada where the US child protective service doesn't have any jurisdiction have extradition now, okay, the Toronto Star article itself isn't online anymore, and the wayback machine doesn't have a snapshot of it. But cruising around, I was able to find some other cases that Alex might want to consider. And late October 2003, a 23 year old mother in Summerville, Georgia was arrested for throwing her eight month old into a dryer, or in November 2000, a woman in Niles, Miss Michigan was arrested for shutting her six year old son in a running dryer to punish him for playing hide and seek during which time he had hid in the dryer Jesus Christ. One of the things that I sadly learned while prepping this episode is that apparently people put babies and dryers more than you'd think which is horrible. Even if you grant that all the details of the story Alex is telling are true, it's still not a valid point. There are definitely valid critiques of the CPS and foster care system to be made. And anything that can be done to protect the children in that world is a moral imperative to pursue. But abuse like this happens in all different contexts. The image that Alex is trying to present is that it never happens between a parent and a child. And whenever there's a headline that reads like that's the case, it's secretly a situation where the CPS is abusing children and trying to blame it on parents because the globalist tape families Yeah, in hindsight, it really shouldn't come as a huge surprise that Alex got caught up in shit like pizza gate, the Wayfair stuff, and pretty much every other child abuse Satanic Panic we've seen over the last years, he's never really taking the issue seriously. So what he's doing now is more or less the natural progression of what you see even back in 2003 Yeah, it's a cartoonish pneus around a fairly serious issue."

So many of the other fires were smaller in nature, but they contributed to an environment where firefighting resources were spread thin made worse by a dry season, and the arrival of some bad Santa Ana winds that made fire spread much more easily. The Cedar Fire which the San Diego government describes as quote, the largest wildland fire in California history was started quote, when a hunter became lost and lit a small fire to signal for help. One of the other large fires called the old fire was started by an arsonist named Ricky Lee Fowler, who burned the house down after he was kicked out of it. The fire ended up killing five people and in 2013, he was found guilty of those murders and sentenced to death. Another of the large fires was the grand prix fire which was suspicious, but was called an accident by investigators in 2004, likely the result of an exhaust spark or cigarette but sure, I'm not sure what our evidence Alex is basing his claims on and he doesn't cite a single source other than his memories of unnamed news things he claimed to have seen. So it seems like maybe he's just talking shit. If I had to guess I would say that he's taking the fact that the Roblox to fire began at Camp Pendleton and then pretending that some of these other fires like the old or Grand Prix also had military involvement in their ignition.

This fire burned for just short of a month and ended up covering over 84,000 acres of land. And it was also in the woods, which fits Alex's description. Initially, folks thought that it was possibly caused by a lightning strike. But investigators fairly quickly ruled that out as none of the telltale signs were there. It's believed that it was human caused. And while the definite origin isn't known, there was a man who ended up being charged with and convicted of lying to investigators about whether or not he was smoking on the trail that day, exactly where the fire was known to have started, right. It's a pretty safe assumption that this was the inciting incident that caused the fire. Or I guess secret globalist military exercises involve setting off giant fires for some unknown and unachieved goal. Yeah, Alex is welcome to prove that if he wants, yeah, in the interest of full disclosure, the military does hold training exercises twice a year in that area, in a program called Angel funder. It's about personnel recovery, but it absolutely would not be taking place near the trail where the fire started. Yeah. And the program began in 2006. Sure, but there is that there is a base, right nearby this Mount Lemmon, right, the area where the fire was. And so it's conceivable that there might have been some sort of an exercise that pre existed. Angel thunder. Yeah. Yeah, for sure.

The mayor gets up and goes we've been attacked by terrorists in the headlines and newspaper said, Belton is in the film, attacked by terrorist. And I said to the mayor at the end of it, I said, Sir, this has all been a drill. And he goes, of course, it's been a drill. But again, that was at the bottom of a two page article that it was a drill, but you're reading it having the emotional response. You see, this is what happens to an unconscious mass of people.

And you'll emotionally think that there are more attacks than there actually are. Because of your heightened state of subconscious fear. The globalists will be able to exploit you into supporting things that are sold to you in the name of protecting you from these attacks course, in more present times these exercises exist to give cover to real false flag attacks. For instance, the operation lockstep shit existed so that the globalists could plan the COVID-19 release. And if anyone was caught, they could say it was part of the exercise. Leaving aside how stupid that theory is. It's the it's worlds apart from this 2003 understanding of these exercises.

Unfortunately, this is exactly the kind of thinking that left unexamined for too long and enabled by a further radicalized conspiracy environment leads to a person losing a billion dollars. All that stuff about Columbine does sound remarkably similar to the stuff Alex says about Sandy Hook. Yeah, not necessarily in terms of the specifics of the claim, but the way that there's a collection of claims that he almost certainly got from completely disreputable sources, which aren't accurate, but he throws out anyway to defend his contention that it was a big theatrical event. Yeah, it's the same way that he has all of these talking points.

I would go up try to disarm one gun and kill the others, I would fight them. My instinct is to fight thugs and fight scum. And, you know, that's how men were in the past, folks, our forefathers had incredible courage when I was on sailing ships or, you know, you know, in faraway lands, regardless of what color we are men were men, women were women. You know, this is how it operated. I am not a castrated coward. And I know I can end up the scurvy with O'Brien hanging over me. And you know, they may be able to torture me enough to where I cry and say I love Big Brother. But the point is, I stood up and I fought. And we have this freedom. We have this bounty, we have this liberty because countless hundreds of 1000s and millions of people died in defense of humanity. And I'm part of that stream of history.

This is the way that he wants people to see him because it helps make you more appealing to folks who fancy themselves also to be above politics, pendant thinker, right. But what Alex seems to actually mean is a bit different. He opposes bush, and because of that people on the right assume he's on the left, the left right paradigm he's against is the assumption that because you oppose a Republican, you must be attacking from the left, right. When Alex says he's above the left right paradigm, what he's essentially saying is that he wants to make people aware that you can attack the GOP from the right, yeah, based on his use of the term and his clear ignorance about pretty basic stuff in terms of politics and civics. I kind of think he doesn't understand that this is what he mean, you are 100% Correct.

I've tracked Alex's answer. And here is what he says in response to a very straightforward question about where these reports are that he's talking about. First, he brings up the CFR who have about five different kinds of reports, right? This seems to imply that all of these kinds of reports spring forth from the CFR maybe. So they put out the foreign affairs but Foreign Affairs is a public facing propaganda outlet. So that's not actually what we're talking about.

Then you start to learn the names of the people in these groups and you see them writing articles. This is again, outward facing propaganda, but I guess you can use this to check your work against these internal documents to illustrate that they're putting out propaganda to the masses, right and speaking openly in secret, but these documents show that they're working towards a similar goal, right? This is all completely useless as an answer to this caller because Do you have nowhere to go with what you've been told? The caller is obviously looking for more information. And you would think that someone in Alex's position would be eager to give that person specifics about how they could find hard evidence that shows that Alex is right about the nonsense that he spouts.
