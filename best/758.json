Maryland wanted to be in charge of the river, but the court said no. Court battle of who gets to the river. Okay, Alex is a really bad source of information, because pretty much everything he's saying in that clip is incorrect. He's telling this color inaccurate information and then using that to construct false narratives about the reality that we all live in. The 1997 Supreme Court case that Alex is talking about is Prince versus United States, and it did not determine that the Brady gun bill was unconstitutional. That bill had a provision that required gun background checks to be done for purchases. But on the federal level, that system was not prepared yet. According to the bill, state law enforcement agencies were required to use their background check system to run this until such time that the federal system was ready. Prince versus United States ruled that this was unconstitutional to make state law enforcement carry out federal law enforcement activity. The state law enforcement folks were required to be asked to do this. And then if they wanted to opt out they could. That was the result of this ruling. Ultimately, most states had no problem with the setup and continued to participate by their own consent, and the issue became moot once the federal background check system was operational. Naturally, Alex is lying about the Supreme Court decision to tell it this color that the government ruled the background checks for gun purchases was unconstitutional, but they didn't care. They just ignore rulings that they don't like. This is a dangerous message to be sending to an audience like Alex's because if the government doesn't even follow Supreme Court decisions, then isn't everything a farce? There's literally no way the public can be involved in politics and the globalists just decide who's going to win elections. And they can just act capriciously and decide whether or not to follow their own courts decisions. This is not a state of affairs that anyone rational or sincere would be presenting as just the way things are, this would be a message that implies the need for action, and all Civic, participatory government related actions are clearly pointless, based on his talent."

And he does zero show prep, too. It's not in his interest to be specific because he's lying. And he doesn't want to make it easy for his audience to follow up his claims and realize that because he's so unspecific, I'm left to assume that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals case in San Francisco that he's referring to his Nordyke versus King, since that was a decision that came down in 2003 and was not accepted by the Supreme Court. That ruling has to do it's not with banning guns or declaring that there's no second amendment. It was a situation where a gun dealers sued Alameda County because the county had passed an ordinance banning possession of guns on county property. This included the fairgrounds which is where Nordyke the gun dealer held gun shows that are attendance was passed in 1999. And the reason was, was stated as being because there was a shooting that happened the previous Fourth of July, at the Allemagne affair, there was believed to be a bit of a gang confrontation that resulted in 10 injuries, including an eight year old boy and two other miners, right? This case about this ordinance is the closest thing I can find what Alex is talking about. And it's nowhere close to reflecting any of his narratives. I wonder if he gives some specifics about the story later in the episode. He doesn't. You shouldn't be optimistic that that information is going to come. It's just this dis ruling and because of the Supreme Court decided not to hear it. Now the Second Amendment's gone. No, no, no, the if they just ruled that a county does have the ability to ban runs on county property."

But if they don't pretend this Supreme Court decision is the end of the Second Amendment, then according to Alex, they have to be liars and probably gun grabbers in disguise. This strategy has a couple of good effects from Alex's standpoint. The first is that it makes anything the NRA does look less extreme and always not enough. The audience will always demand that the gun rights organizations take a couple more steps than they should because they believe that they're responding to the fake stories, Alex tells them. The second effect is that the audience will push the NRA further towards living in Alex's false reality, or at least behaving as if that false reality were real, in order to keep up with the base. For any sense of this, consider that Ted Nugent was a fairly controversial person to associate with back at this point. And he's now a member of the NRA Board.

      "text": "the reason this clip is important is that it really has echoes of how Alex dealt with yay and Nick and the present day. He has a caller who's admitted to being a proud Klan member, which is something Alex is supposedly against in the same way he's supposedly against Hitler and the Nazis these days. And yet somehow, Alex can't manage to make a clear, emphatic statement in opposition to these groups. With Yann Nick, he can't rebuke the Nazi and Hitler's ship choosing instead to pretend that the ADL is worse than Nick and because of fake stories that he repeats over and over about how they think white people are inherently evil. The only way to give voice to criticism of yay and Nick's Nazi ideas is to condemn them along with the ADL, and be very insistent that the ADL is worse. And here Alex can't just tell this caller that the Klan is bad and he shouldn't be a member of it. Instead, he rattles off a bizarre rationalization for why he assumes this guy joined the clan, which I don't think is too far off from what folks in the clan might say. They also love to pretend that their racism is justified by imagining it only exists as a defense against other people being racist against them. This is Alex giving the appearance of pushing back against this guy who's literally in the Klan, while actually making excuses for him and making the act of joining a hate group a possibly unwise, but morally neutral decision. This is because Alex doesn't actually think being a member of a hate group is a bad thing. He can't even get through this response to the caller without speculating how white people would be arrested for open carrying, while black people get away with it, essentially justifying and signing off on the feelings of racial aggrievement that drive a lot of people toward these racist groups. Here's an important thing to understand. Even if a listener or this caller were to accept Alex's framing of things and concede at all, there's still no reason not to be a member of the clan. If and only if we're able to defeat the globalists, then these racist groups will stop being played against each other. But until that happens, and even they understand that that's never going to happen, then these other races groups will still exist. The Klan members and Nazis believe that they are defensive organizations. So if those other groups still exist, their rationale for the racism remains entirely intact. I understand that Alex doesn't show up to the studio knowing that like he's going to be on the phone with a Klan member. But he definitely should have known it was a distinct possibility. Like he knows who his audience is, and the fact that he doesn't have any stronger condemnation for the Klan than this is damning. It's shockingly bad."
