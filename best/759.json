And also, with the law, it really frustrates me how, you know, we do have a lot of good legal reporters, Liz Williamson, for instance, she's done a great job on this. But Oh, of course, a lot of other people just need to stop, they need to stop. So. So frustrated, because I see the headline, and I see some tweets, you know, that, of course have 50,000 likes on them by this point saying, oh, Alex doesn't have to pay for one and a half billion dollar judgment, or he does have to pay that one and a half billion dollar judgment and a judge has, you know, taken away his ability to fight it. And of course, that's not what happened at all. So I thought I was crazy, actually, because I was saying, Well, you know, this, this outlet is saying it this happened. And I don't remember that happening. Have I you know, blacked out somehow and remembered something different. And no, it turns out, I was right. So it's a, there's a there is a consent judgment in place, which means that both Alex and the plaintiffs are agreeing to this. Everyone's in agreement."

When you're talking about, you know, people like Robbie Parker, who did get about, I want to say total amount was 200 million, but including the punitive, and everything how it shakes out. But um, but yeah, so that's not what happened. What happened, though, is that the judgment has been lifted onto those cases just for procedural issues to go forward. Norm is also has a motion for a new trial, which everybody knows nor even knows that those Mote his motions are going to get denied. But basically, the bankruptcy court is saying, yeah, those judgments and go ahead and be entered, and then you can proceed with the appeals process. And those cases. Now, the Fontaine case and the Posner case, those are still stayed. Right as of right, right, right. So yeah, that's that's what's happening there. It was not a judge saying up, Alex has to write a check tomorrow, you know, and that's what I feel like a lot of people got wrong here. And also, I did want to say this hasn't come up yet. It has kind of come up in the background of the conversations, as I've kind of read between the lines, as I've listened to the attorneys speak in these hearings with Judge Lopez, and the bankruptcy court, but Bankruptcy Code section 533. A six actually prevents a debtor from being discharged for any debt for the willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity. So actually, awful and malicious injuries cannot be discharged in bankruptcy regardless. And okay, I think this is going to be litigated on if this counts, but I would say, you know, the punitive damages, which had to be awarded, if they were if, you know, you've the jury has found that his conduct was willful and malicious. I mean, it speaks to itself. Right. So I really just think that this these bankruptcies in the personal one and the company one is Alex delaying, because what I noticed was when I watched the latest Texas hearing, I saw Mark, essentially saying, Okay, well, we're fine to go ahead and schedule Fontaine and Posner because we can proceed against Alex Jones individually. And, you know, I get that lo and behold, December 2, he filed for personal bankruptcy. But I think that this is going to end up backfiring on him, I think his strategy here is that he is going to try to, you know, drag these families out, we're going to have to go through the whole bankruptcy process versus, you know, credit or committee and the personal one, there's, you know, we're going to have to submit plans to repay debt and negotiate all that out between all the creditors in the company one. So I think what he then does via appeals process, and I think what Alex is doing here is he's trying to number one, buy more time for himself. And number two, were these families down hoping that they'll settle?"

And yet they still manage to, you know, be positive and try to bring light and try to be a better force in the world for good.

One of the questions that people ask us all the time after, you know, six years of this nonsense is how do you feel like it's affected you as a person in the way you think about things? And I was wondering the same for you. Because when you immerse yourself in this kind of space, the way that we have done it does change you. So I was wondering what kind of feelings that are what kind of feeling of change do you have?"

So I I would actually say not to be corny about it. But I would say it actually has I feel like made me a better lawyer and a better communicator with how I talk about the law with people because that's something I've done. actually even discovered I have a real passion for is telling people about what's going on in these types of cases and providing some sort of analysis with that. I mean, I don't know necessarily what that means. But also it's changed me in the fact that I was, you know, very despondent about the state of the legal profession. And, you know, thinking of, you know, it seems like all these there's just so many Grifters in the legal profession, and it feels like the only way to get ahead is to be one of these despicable people. And here I am refusing but you know, there's no, I felt like there, there was like, no advantage of his profession, unless you were one of those types. Honestly, I started the show. But I was, you know, trying to, you know, I was steadfast and that I wouldn't sink to those levels. And I still am, and hopefully, always will be God willing. But I, yeah, I feel like I have gotten hope, again, and that there are good attorneys, that there are attorneys who care about the principles of this profession who can and there are judges who care about what's fair and justice and doing the right thing, and holding people to account and there are jury people who made up the juries, you know, as as we talked about people who say no, this is wrong, and also that punish that we are now punishing attorneys who break the rules and are Grifters and I feel like that has changed and made me a lot more hopeful about this profession, that I'm actually seeing consequences now for the bad actions, whereas it felt like before, they seem to be the ones taking advantage while everybody else was behind. So I feel like my faith in the legal depression, but legal Depression, depression, depression, that's"
