When I ask Wang near the end of our time together, what sorts of thoughts he has when he contemplates the improbable arc of his life. He says he mostly feels lucky. Lucky to have come of age when China was undergoing its reform. Quote, 30 years ago, people in China all had the same life. We were given rations of food. He says the reform gave us the right to choose. And the freedom of choice allowed people with a will and an ambition to achieve in the past. Only the emperor could drink this tea. Why? Says Wang before we part with one of his biggest grins of the morning? Today? Anyone with enough money can buy it?

Yeah, we have the Old Dominion study where this guy who wrote the studies has stopped using it, you're twisting the fact we have a Pew Research about illegal voting where the guy has consistently gone on record and said, they are not saying what my study shows. Yeah. Now there's the George Washington study, which I was unable to find. I'm not entirely sure what that was. So I can't speak to that. But I did a little bit of further research into the Old Dominion study. And one of the things I found was I'll just I'll just read this off verbatim, a recent study by political science, scientists at Old Dominion University use the 2008 and 2010 cooperative congressional election study, to examine whether, quote non citizens vote in US elections. The authors reported about 1% of the respondents in each survey identified themselves as non citizen immigrants 339 in 2008 489, and 2010. Estimating that 21 of these self identified non citizens voted in 2008, and eight of self identified non citizens voted in 2010. They use this to project national voting rates of the US non citizen population. In an October 24 blog, Jesse Richmond and David earnest two authors of the study admitted that their quote, extrapolation of specific state level or district level election outcomes is fraught with substantial uncertainty. The authors noted that the non citizen sample they examined was modest, and relied on self reporting, which can create errors and attempt to verify the accuracy of their self reporting was imperfect and supplemented by estimates."
