But notice the stock market went up $1,200,000,000,000, just the last month or so, because a lot of institutional investors and others understand with Trump trying to create real prosperity, not a bunch of social engineering, and I'm not here to pitch Trump to people.

And so they're rolling those groups up right now. They really are standing up against them. And this is a historic moment.

Yeah, he tried to crash the pound bring down England, he's really bad news. So mi 618. But long story short about George Soros. He's funding this attack on me and any independent media, how do you attack independent media, when the public's awake to Deep State and Government stuff? You say Alex Jones is the government. And then they always ignore real facts. I talk about her I admit. So my family of stuff does work for the government. And they said the garbage was corrupted out of control.

I kind of let them convince me but I think back to the point in the conference room, I just kind of went okay, okay, okay, sure. I get it and then I went, and then once I decided it was true, I really pushed it. So it's almost like I lied to myself because I'm being honest about this process so so this is what happened. for like a year and a half. I'm saying it's BS it's a government hoax because they're like the Navy says the chips are all bad for cities will completely fall and it's all the death I said, they just want to upgrade with all this new spy hubs, they want to do global standardization for the US is the Telecommunications Act of 96. They want to force all the new chips because I had NSA sources then that I was heading on okay. And I didn't realize how special was that I had the sources they're telling me it's all BS. People like don't argue with the Navy and don't and Fox News and ads to get your food was just everywhere. So I went okay, hell, okay, stuffs gonna be real. So it was like a Black Friday for the Black Friday deal. So the last few months. And the moral was ended up firing me anyways, they did, but the moral was I kind of convinced myself it was real. So by the end of it, of course, they edit like, you know, 12 hours beyond that day, and like five minutes, I'm totally insane, right, but it's like nuclear reactor having a problem here. And it really was happening. And like, you know, oh, and there was a missile firing from Russia, which like, was an ICBM, and they got like, shut down. That was ABC News. So I'm like, alright, this isn't really happening. Okay. We got prepared. It's always good to prepare, but oh no reactor is having a problem. Okay, some stuff. So there was some outages of some problems, but government and MSM had hyped it. Then they use it to demonize alternative media even then, when it wasn't catastrophic. So my gut told me it was BS. It was BS. And so thank God, I missed the whole 2012 thing. But still, they said Alex Jones says the world's ending the bureau 2012 where he restaurants when I say it's all a load of crap, but I didn't criticize you when I saw you doing it. I said I"

Do you want the interviews on YouTube? Do you want to know what he said? Yes. He was a World War Two fighter pilot. At the end of World War Two, he flew the first planes in hurricanes, which which are in the Atlantic, that's pretty gangster, and in two typhoons that are even faster in the Pacific.

No one thought to call the old man from Lubbock or whatever it was, right. So I call him I get him on. They sent a bunch of people to their company and threatened him the next week after I read it. And he laid it out. He said, In 1967, we certified at the Stanford Research Institute that he was able to control hurricanes, create hurricanes, and steer hurricanes, all that got black budgeted shut down. And then they got into these arrays where they could use antennas. And out of that, and Westinghouse came came the the whole heart program. So in the 60s, they could create control and steer or kill hurricanes.

The part where Brennan mentions geoengineering is just one example out of several not often mentioned issues, the CIA monitors for potential elements of instability in the world, a s AI program, if ever implemented could penetrate conflicts and security threats if misused. The CIA's job is to consider all types of concepts, concepts for potential future problems and threats, including the science oriented concepts that's totally botched. Let me break down the right. But isn't that possible? But what that guy just said, is that possible? No. That's basically what Brennan said. What he's saying is that there are potential threats. Mentally it's an issue. Right.

The elite are all about transcendence and living forever, and the secrets of the universe. And they want to know all this. Some are good, some are bad. Some are a mix. But the good ones don't ever want to organize the bad ones and want to organize because they lust for power. Powerful, consciousnesses don't want to dominate other people, they want to empower them. So they don't tend to get together until things are really late in the game, then they come together evils always defeated, because good is so much stronger. And we're on this planet. And Einstein's physics show that Max Planck says shut it off. There's at least 12 dimensions. And now that's all the top scientists and billionaires are coming up saying it's a false hologram it is artificial, the computers are scanning it and finding tension points where it's artificially projected. And gravity's bleeding in to this universe. That's what they call dark matter. We're like a thought or a dream. That's a wisp in some computer program, some Gods mind, whatever, they're proving it all, it's all coming out. Now there's like this sub transmission zone below the third dimension, that's just turned over the most horrible things is what it resonates to. And it's trying to get up into the third dimension. That's just a basic level consciousness to launch into the next levels. And our species is already way up in the fifth sixth dimension consciously our best people, but there's this big war trying to like basically destroy humanity, because humanity has freewill. And there's a decision to which level we want to go to, we have free will. So evils allowed to come and contend and not just good. And the elites themselves, believe their racing will using human technology to try to take our best minds and build some type of breakaway civilization, where they're going to merge with machines transcend, and break away from the failed species of his man, which is kind of like a false transmission because they're thinking what they are is ugly and bad. projecting it onto themselves instead of believing. No, it's a human test about building us up. And so Google was set up at 19 years ago, this was I knew about this before it was declassified."

Now, if you were that guy living in a world full of the rest of us, why wouldn't you believe crazy nonsense, right, Billy? Now Descartes, on the other hand, Descartes was a mathematician, not a logician. Well, a philosopher. Yeah, well, yeah. But even then, it was because of his affinity to math. All of all of his, all of his syllogisms were purely if A then B kind of situations. Sure, it was all opponents. Exactly. Now, Isaac Newton, on the other hand, was a pure Alpha Alchemist.

She was CIA, bringing back people to us and sham marriages to have them emigrate. It was basically a cover up for the fact that his real father was Frank Marshall Davis, the communist.
