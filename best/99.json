I don't want to I don't want to give money to Muslim immigrants, something along those lines. And everyone got surprised. I'm like, Guys, yeah, I'm we've we've been over this. You know, like, everyone's getting hundreds of retweets for being like Laura Loomer sucks and like, we could have told you that six months ago, that's when she went on Alex's show and said that there are no ratter there are no rational Muslims. There's no moderate Muslims, when she went on the show and said that everyone one's in denial about the idea that we're at war with that religion.

Are you like an organized criminal? You're saying no to us? Who told you how to lie like this? And I'm like you people are crazy.

Otherwise Columbia allowed him to do this. I mean, free speech, baby. You know, you can exploit it pretty far. So Michael Colombia sucks. Mike Cernovich was giving a speech there and some Antifa came to protest. And they had a sign that said no white supremacy. No pedo bashing? No. Mike Cernovich."

Yeah, and that it was clearly an All right plant. The guy in the mask disappeared. Yep. And they got a good picture though. I mean, not a good picture but they got a picture that's good enough.

As long as you ditch the racist propaganda. And you don't you aren't beholden to these ideas, right? Then society can function. Because we can have a polite disagreement about stuff. And some places can implement some plan. Some places can implement other, and we can see what works. That's the idea of government. I get, I guess, governments and stuff like that. There is something to that. Now, if you want to dismantle the entire federal government in the name of states, right, you're stupid that we can't do. But the idea of like, the idea that people pitch in terms of states rights, about like, let's see how things work in Colorado, and then maybe if that works there, if we can expand it, like that is kind of what happened with marijuana legalization. Yeah, they had the right to do that. And we learned it fucking worked super well. And so other states adopt it. Yeah, that is the kind of thing that I understand where that philosophy comes from. And I don't hate it. Now, if you want to say that all conservative. ideology is stupid, and it's a con. I disagree with you because I think that's as bad as Alex calling all liberals stupid. But I don't I don't. I don't think that you're dumb. And I don't think that like I don't think you have haven't thought out your opinions. Yeah. And I certainly think that most of the people that we recognize as conservative politicians aren't necessarily just that right. But I, the point I want to get to is is there are instances of political disagreements that are acceptable"

I think the problem that we're having, or at least in this discussion, is a lot of the polite disagreements that we're talking about happened hundreds of years ago and are settled. We're just still having those disagreements I know I somewhat in the future future when we're talking about cuz, cuz I don't agree with a lot of different ways. And I absolutely think that the one is one of the Terry's a certain progressive, that can go, you know, we're not Pollyanna, there is a rational approach to take. But at the same time, trickle down economics is magical. It doesn't exist. So that conservative, polite disagreement is gone. There is no further discussion of tax breaks for the rich, leading to economic growth. We're done there. So that's not a polite disagreement. Well, that's a disagree as you're making it reality."
